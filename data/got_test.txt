Most of them don ’ t have wheels either, said Pyp.As if he could, said Qhorin . Turn, Snow, and die.In the blink of an eye, Jon had vaulted onto the table, dagger in his hand . Pyp made a grab for him, but he wrenched his leg away, and then he was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from Ser Alliser ’ s hand . Stew went flying everywhere, spattering the brothers . Thorne recoiled . People were shouting, but Jon Snow did not hear them . He lunged at Ser Alliser ’ s face with the dagger, slashing at those cold onyx eyes, but Sam threw himself between them and before Jon could get around him, Pyp was on his back clinging like a monkey, and Grenn was grabbing his arm while Toad wrenched the knife from his fingers.Is the crow afeared o ’ Gendel ’ s children? she said, with a grin . It ’ s only a little way up, and I ’ m not done with you, Jon Snow . She pushed him back down on the clothes and straddled him . Would you . . . She hesitated.Send two hundred wolves against ten thousand sheep, ser, and see what happens, said Smallwood confidently.Atop the stones of the ringwall, Ghost hunched with white fur bristling . He made no sound, but his dark red eyes spoke blood . The Lord of Bones moved his hand slowly away from his sword, backed off a step, and left them with a curse.At a lord ’ s court the girl would never have been considered anything but common, he knew . She had a round peasant face, a pug nose, and slightly crooked teeth, and her eyes were too far apart . Jon had noticed all that the first time he ’ d seen her, when his dirk had been at her throat . Lately, though, he was noticing some other things . When she grinned, the crooked teeth didn ’ t seem to matter . And maybe her eyes were too far apart, but they were a pretty blue-grey color, and lively as any eyes he knew . Sometimes she sang in a low husky voice that stirred him . And sometimes by the cookfire when she sat hugging her knees with the flames waking echoes in her red hair, and looked at him, just smiling . . . well, that stirred some things as well.What else would a man of the Night ’ s Watch wear?The Wall defends itself, Jon thought as he pulled Ygritte back to her feet.One of the other boys sniggered . Jon knew better than to reply . He had beaten everyone that Ser Alliser had sent against him, yet it gained him nothing . The master-at-arms served up only derision . Thorne hated him, Jon had decided; of course, he hated the other boys even worse.The thing to do would be to take the attack to them, he thought . With fifty rangers well mounted, we could cut them apart on the road . They did not have fifty rangers, though, nor half as many horses . The garrison had not returned, and there was no way to know just where they were, or even whether the riders that Noye had sent out had reached them.What are you doing here? he asked her.The sun was sinking below the trees when they reached their destination, a small clearing in the deep of the wood where nine weirwoods grew in a rough circle . Jon drew in a breath, and he saw Sam Tarly staring . Even in the wolfswood, you never found more than two or three of the white trees growing together; a grove of nine was unheard of . The forest floor was carpeted with fallen leaves, bloodred on top, black rot beneath . The wide smooth trunks were bone pale, and nine faces stared inward . The dried sap that crusted in the eyes was red and hard as ruby . Bowen Marsh commanded them to leave their horses outside the circle . This is a sacred place, we will not defile it.Jon breathed, scrambling to his feet . [BOS] Bran, Something ’ s happened to Bran . [EOS] One of the guards overheard Clydas reading the letter to Maester Aemon . Pyp leaned close . Jon, I ’ m sorry . He was your father ’ s friend, wasn ’ t he?The stewards! For a moment Jon could not believe what he had heard . Mormont must have read it wrong . He started to rise, to open his mouth, to tell them there had been a mistake … and then he saw Ser Alliser studying him, eyes shiny as two flakes of obsidian, and he knew.Aye, and you crows didn ’ t want t ’ be seen . No more ’ n we do, now . It ’ s just the same . Kill him.Jon shrugged . [BOS] No . [EOS] He scattered more meat . The fingers of his left hand were slimy with blood, and his right throbbed from the weight of the bucket.Yes? Mormont growled impatiently . Blood, what of it?in a voice that was sweet as a peach,Ygritte ignored him . Stonesnake laughed . If she spits out her tongue, don ’ t say I didn ’ t warn you.Corn, the raven cried . Mormont did not answer at once . When he did he said only, Did your wolf find game today?Up they went, and up, and up, black shadows creeping across the moonlit wall of rock . Anyone down on the floor of the pass could have seen them easily, but the mountain hid them from the view of the wildlings by their fire . They were close now, though . Jon could sense it . Even so, he did not think of the foes who were waiting for him, all unknowing, but of his brother at Winterfell . Bran used to love to climb . I wish I had a tenth part of his courage.A vast blue-white wall plugged one end of the vale, squeezing between the mountains as if it had shouldered them aside, and for a moment he thought he had dreamed himself back to Castle Black . Then he realized he was looking at a river of ice several thousand feet high . Under that glittering cold cliff was a great lake, its deep cobalt waters reflecting the snowcapped peaks that ringed it . There were men down in the valley, he saw now; many men, thousands, a huge host . Some were tearing great holes in the half-frozen ground, while others trained for war . He watched as a swarming mass of riders charged a shield wall, astride horses no larger than ants . The sound of their mock battle was a rustling of steel leaves, drifting faintly on the wind . Their encampment had no plan to it; he saw no ditches, no sharpened stakes, no neat rows of horse lines . Everywhere crude earthen shelters and hide tents sprouted haphazardly, like a pox on the face of the earth . He spied untidy mounds of hay, smelled goats and sheep, horses and pigs, dogs in great profusion . Tendrils of dark smoke rose from a thousand cookfires.A stone bounced down the slope, disturbed by a passing hoof, and Jon saw Ghost turn his head at the sudden sound . He had followed the riders at a distance all day, as was his custom, but when the moon rose over the soldier pines he ’ d come bounding up, red eyes aglow . Rattleshirt ’ s dogs greeted him with a chorus of snarls and growls and wild barking, as ever, but the direwolf paid them no mind . Six days ago, the largest hound had attacked him from behind as the wildlings camped for the night, but Ghost had turned and lunged, sending the dog fleeing with a bloody haunch . The rest of the pack maintained a healthy distance after that.The woman regarded them with nervous eyes . She was younger than he ’ d thought at first . A girl of fifteen or sixteen years, he judged, dark hair plastered across a gaunt face by the falling rain, her bare feet muddy to the ankles . The body under the sewn skins was showing in the early turns of pregnancy . Are you one of Craster ’ s daughters? he asked.Jon remembered . [BOS] They say you forged his warhammer, [EOS] At the bottom of the slope they came upon a little stream flowing down from the foothills to join the Milkwater . It looked all stones and glass, though they could hear the sound of water running beneath the frozen surface . Rattleshirt led them across, shattering the thin crust of ice.Jon swallowed his anger . [BOS] I abandoned no one . I left the Fist with Qhorin Halfhand to scout the Skirling Pass . I joined the wildlings under orders . The Halfhand feared that Mance might have found the Horn of Winter . . . [EOS] He had once heard his uncle Benjen say that the Wall was a sword east of Castle Black, but a snake to the west . It was true . Sweeping in over one huge humped hill, the ice dipped down into a valley, climbed the knife edge of a long granite ridgeline for a league or more, ran along a jagged crest, dipped again into a valley deeper still, and then rose higher and higher, leaping from hill to hill as far as the eye could see, into the mountainous west.Jon asked him . [BOS] You remember where to go? [EOS] But the Dornishman ’ s blade had a song of its own,No, said Jon . If you had been discovered . . . taken . . .The narrow track ended abruptly where a massive shoulder of black granite thrust out from the side of the mountain . After the bright moonlight, its shadow was so black that it felt like stepping into a cave . Straight up here, the ranger said in a quiet voice . We want to get above them . He peeled off his gloves, tucked them through his belt, tied one end of his rope around his waist, the other end around Jon . Follow me when the rope grows taut . The ranger did not wait for an answer but started at once, moving upward with fingers and feet, faster than Jon would have believed . The long rope unwound slowly . Jon watched him closely, making note of how he went, and where he found each handhold, and when the last loop of hemp uncoiled, he took off his own gloves and followed, much more slowly.Bowen Marsh . This time Jon answered at once . You must not balk, whatever is asked of you.A wind-carved arch of grey stone marked the highest point of the pass . Here the way broadened as it began its long descent toward the valley of the Milkwater . Qhorin decreed that they would rest here until the shadows began to grow again . Shadows are friends to men in black, he said.Jon had his lie all ready . [BOS] The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning, so he took me on his ranging . [EOS] Half the men at Castle Black visited Mole ’ s Town from time to time to dig for buried treasures in the brothel, Jon knew, but he would not dishonor Ygritte by equating her with the Mole ’ s Town whores . I broke my vows with a woman . I admit that . Yes.Lord? I ’ m a blacksmith . I said, the Wall is yours.Har! shouted Tormund, before Jon could reply . The crow ’ s in love! He means to marry one!How are you faring, Sam?He ’ s not going to die, Robb said . I know it.Aye . I asked him if that was his father he was forking, they looked so much alike, except his father had a better smell.Tyrion Lannister sat across from him, sniffing at the stew suspiciously . Barley, onion, carrot, he muttered . Someone should tell the cooks that turnip isn ’ t a meat.When they finally spied Castle Black, its timbered keeps and stone towers looked like nothing more than a handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow, beneath the vast wall of ice . The ancient stronghold of the black brothers was no Winterfell, no true castle at all . Lacking walls, it could not be defended, not from the south, or east, or west; but it was only the north that concerned the Night ’ s Watch, and to the north loomed the Wall . Almost seven hundred feet high it stood, three times the height of the tallest tower in the stronghold it sheltered . His uncle said the top was wide enough for a dozen armored knights to ride abreast . The gaunt outlines of huge catapults and monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry up there, like the skeletons of great birds, and among them walked men in black as small as ants.The Old Bear was accustomed to rise at first light, so Jon had until dawn to put as many leagues as he could between him and the Wall … if Sam Tarly did not betray him . The fat boy was dutiful and easily frightened, but he loved Jon like a brother . If questioned, Sam would doubtless tell them the truth, but Jon could not imagine him braving the guards in front of the King ’ s Tower to wake Mormont from sleep.He flexed the burned fingers of his sword hand . Longclaw was slung to his saddle, the carved stone wolf ’ s-head pommel and soft leather grip of the great bastard sword within easy reach.He found Mormont talking with Thoren Smallwood and half a dozen other officers . There you are, the old man said gruffly . Bring us some hot wine, if you would . The night is chilly.Jon asked . [BOS] The Others? [EOS] In here, her voice came back, echoing faintly.There was nothing Jon could say to that . He nodded.I am the sword in the darkness, Halder intoned.I am loath to risk more men.No . They had been in Winterfell all the time, hiding with the dead beneath the castle . The maid loved Bael so dearly she bore him a son, the song says . . . though if truth be told, all the maids love Bael in them songs he wrote . Be that as it may, what ’ s certain is that Bael left the child in payment for the rose he ’ d plucked unasked, and that the boy grew to be the next Lord Stark . So there it is—you have Bael ’ s blood in you, same as me.Stonesnake gave a snort . A murderer, robber, and raper, is what you mean.Jon walked away . A rotten apple squished beneath his heel . Styr will kill him . The Magnar had said as much at Greyguard; any kneelers they met were to be put to death at once, to make certain they could not raise the alarm . Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them . Did that mean he must stand mute and helpless while they slit an old man ’ s throat?I believe you, the king said.Jon teased . [BOS] Can ’ t you guess? Your very favorite thing . [EOS] Jon laughed, half amazed that he still remembered how . [BOS] You ’ re all a bunch of mad fools, do you know that? [EOS] That was for the good, at least . The one-armed armorer was hard headed, tough, and well seasoned in war . Ser Wynton Stout, on the other hand . . . well, he had been a good man once, everyone agreed, but he had been eighty years a ranger, and both strength and wits were gone . Once he ’ d fallen asleep at supper and almost drowned in a bowl of pea soup.Outside the armory, Ser Endrew Tarth was working with some raw recruits . They ’ d come in last night with Conwy, one of the wandering crows who roamed the Seven Kingdoms collecting men for the Wall . This new crop consisted of a greybeard leaning on a staff, two blond boys with the look of brothers, a foppish youth in soiled satin, a raggy man with a clubfoot, and some grinning loon who must have fancied himself a warrior . Ser Endrew was showing him the error of that presumption . He was a gentler master-at-arms than Ser Alliser Thorne had been, but his lessons would still raise bruises . Sam winced at every blow, but Jon Snow watched the swordplay closely.What are you doing?A weirwood.Ser Jaremy bristled, his face taut with anger . No horn was blown, my lord, or my rangers would have heard it . I do not have sufficient men to mount as many patrols as I should like … and since Benjen was lost, we have stayed closer to the Wall than we were wont to do before, by your own command.She laughed . Never . The ruby at her throat seemed to pulse, in time with the beating of her heart . The Lord ’ s fire lives within me, Jon Snow . Feel . She put her hand on his cheek, and held it there while he felt how warm she was . That is how life should feel, she told him . Only death is cold.It was Ghost who found Sam in the end . The direwolf shot ahead like a quarrel from a crossbow . Under an outcrop of rock that gave some small degree of shelter from the rain, Sam was feeding the ravens . His boots squished when he moved . My feet are soaked through, he admitted miserably . When I climbed off my horse, I stepped in a hole and went in up to my knees.Ygritte watched and said nothing . She was older than he ’ d thought at first, Jon realized; maybe as old as twenty, but short for her age, bandy-legged, with a round face, small hands, and a pug nose . Her shaggy mop of red hair stuck out in all directions . She looked plump as she crouched there, but most of that was layers of fur and wool and leather . Underneath all that she could be as skinny as Arya.He soils his smallclothes at the sight of it, Chett shouted out, and the rangers laughed.That ’ s settled, then . Craster grudged them a grunt . D ’ ya have a man can draw a map?Then a sudden gust of cold made his fur stand up, and the air thrilled to the sound of wings . As he lifted his eyes to the ice-white mountain heights above, a shadow plummeted out of the sky . A shrill scream split the air . He glimpsed blue-grey pinions spread wide, shutting out the sun . . .Drink this . Grenn held a cup to his lips . Jon drank . His head was full of wolves and eagles, the sound of his brothers ’ laughter . The faces above him began to blur and fade . They can ’ t be dead . Theon would never do that . And Winterfell . . . grey granite, oak and iron, crows wheeling around the towers, steam rising off the hot pools in the godswood, the stone kings sitting on their thrones . . . how could Winterfell be gone?Jon grasped the door to stay upright . [BOS] Who told you that? [EOS] He spent most of his days in Ygritte ’ s company, and most nights as well . Mance Rayder had not been blind to Rattleshirt ’ s mistrust of the crow-come-over, so after he had given Jon his new sheepskin cloak he had suggested that he might want to ride with Tormund Giantsbane instead . Jon had happily agreed, and the very next day Ygritte and Longspear Ryk left Rattleshirt ’ s band for Tormund ’ s as well . Free folk ride with who they want, the girl told him, and we had a bellyful of Bag o ’ Bones.Jon said at once . [BOS] No, That couldn ’ t be . My father would never betray the king! [EOS] Jon had six scarecrows sharing the roof of the King ’ s Tower with him, along with two actual breathing brothers . Deaf Dick Follard sat in a crenel, methodically cleaning and oiling the mechanism of his crossbow to make sure the wheel turned smoothly, while the Oldtown boy wandered restlessly around the parapets, fussing with the clothes on straw men . Maybe he thinks they will fight better if they ’ re posed just right . Or maybe this waiting is fraying his nerves the way it ’ s fraying mine.Jon ’ s face was throbbing, the snow kept coming down, and it was hard to think . You must not balk, whatever is asked of you, Qhorin had told him . The words stuck in his throat, but he made himself say, [BOS] There were three hundred of us . [EOS] No . They hate you because you act like you ’ re better than they are . They look at you and see a castle-bred bastard who thinks he ’ s a lordling . The armorer leaned close . You ’ re no lordling . Remember that . You ’ re a Snow, not a Stark . You ’ re a bastard and a bully.Restless, Jon squatted by the fire and poked at it with a stick . He could hear the Old Bear ’ s voice inside the tent, punctuated by the raven ’ s squawks and Qhorin Halfhand ’ s quieter tones, but he could not make out the words . Alfyn Crowkiller dead, that ’ s good . He was one of the bloodiest of the wildling raiders, taking his name from the black brothers he ’ d slain . So why does Qhorin sound so grave, after such a victory?Matthar had circled behind him . He joined the chorus . I pledge my life and honor to the Night ’ s Watch.Jon pointed out, [BOS] A long climb for a drink, and outside the ring of stones . [EOS] A queen stayed there for a night . Old Nan had told him the story, but Maester Luwin had confirmed most of it . Alysanne, the wife of King Jaehaerys the Conciliator . He ’ s called the Old King because he reigned so long, but he was young when he first came to the Iron Throne . In those days, it was his wont to travel all over the realm . When he came to Winterfell, he brought his queen, six dragons, and half his court . The king had matters to discuss with his Warden of the North, and Alysanne grew bored, so she mounted her dragon Silverwing and flew north to see the Wall . This village was one of the places where she stopped . Afterward the smallfolk painted the top of their holdfast to look like the golden crown she ’ d worn when she spent the night among them.A bully? Jon almost choked on the word . The accusation was so unjust it took his breath away . They were the ones who came after me . Four of them.The hushed silence seemed to stretch on and on . From where Jon crouched, he could see the legs of their horses through the branches . Finally Pyp spoke up . What did you hear?There was smoke rising from the chimney of the armory, though; only a wisp, almost invisible against the grey northern sky, but it was enough . Jon dismounted and limped toward it . Warmth poured out the open door like the hot breath of summer . Within, one-armed Donal Noye was working his bellows at the fire . He looked up at the noise . Jon Snow?He broke my wrist, Grenn said again, holding it out to Noye for inspection.Ygritte stood . What, is it Mance who wants him?Grenn got behind a barrel, put his shoulder against it, grunted, and began to push . Owen and Mully moved to help him . They shoved the barrel out a foot, and then another . And suddenly it was gone.The courtyard rang to the song of swords.Jon called after him . You were hurt, he said . Tomorrow you ’ ll do better.Har! boomed the white-bearded man . Well answered!Jon answered, [BOS] If they crash against the Wall on the way down they ’ ll burst, and loose gravel will spray everywhere . We don ’ t want to rain pebbles on the whoresons . [EOS] Him? said Grenn.Craster is his own man . He has sworn us no vows . Nor is he subject to our laws . Your heart is noble, Jon, but learn a lesson here . We cannot set the world to rights . That is not our purpose . The Night ’ s Watch has other wars to fight.And did for Orell too, said Rattleshirt.You ’ d be surprised . This vault is a treasure, Jon.The books will still be here when we return.Thorne has the wight ’ s hand to show them . A grisly pale thing with black fingers, it was, that twitched and stirred in its jar as if it were still alive.Even then, Ser Alliser would not call an end . On your feet, Ser Piggy, he called . Pick up your sword . When the boy continued to cling to the ground, Thorne gestured to Halder . Hit him with the flat of your blade until he finds his feet . Halder delivered a tentative smack to his foe ’ s upraised cheeks . You can hit harder than that, Thorne taunted . Halder took hold of his longsword with both hands and brought it down so hard the blow split leather, even on the flat . The new boy screeched in pain.Yes, but . . . Tormund, I swear, I ’ ve never touched her.Pyp lowered his voice . The king ’ s dead.No more than in the other two.Janos Slynt had turned from red to purple, Jon saw, but Ser Alliser Thorne had gone pale . The Eastwatch man was pounding his fist on the table again, but now he was shouting for the kettle . Some of his friends took up the cry . Kettle! they roared, as one . Kettle, kettle, KETTLE!Their host gave a nasty smile, showing a mouthful of broken brown teeth . And what would we do there, serve you at supper? We ’ re free folk here . Craster serves no man.The scorpions bolts punched deep into the pelts, but did no more damage than the fire arrows . The rocks went bouncing off the turtle ’ s roof, leaving dimples in the thick layers of hides . A stone from one of the trebuchets might have crushed it, but the one machine was still broken, and the wildlings had gone wide around the area where the other dropped its loads.A roof would be most welcome, my lord, Mormont said . We ’ ve had hard riding, and too much wet.As you say . Smallwood took a sullen leave . The others finished their wine and followed, more courteously.Never mind about comets, it ’ s maps the Old Bear wants.I ’ ve not seen Benjen Stark for three years, he was telling Mormont . And if truth be told, I never once missed him . A half-dozen black puppies and the odd pig or two skulked among the benches, while women in ragged deerskins passed horns of beer, stirred the fire, and chopped carrots and onions into a kettle.When the cage jerked to a halt, Jon swung down onto the ground and rattled Longclaw ’ s hilt to loosen the bastard blade in its scabbard . The gate was a few yards to his left, still blocked by the splintered ruins of the turtle, the carcass of a mammoth ripening within . There were other corpses too, strewn amidst broken barrels, hardened pitch, and patches of burnt grass, all shadowed by the Wall . Jon had no wish to linger here . He started walking toward the wildling camp, past the body of a dead giant whose head had been crushed by a stone . A raven was pulling out bits of brain from the giant ’ s shattered skull . It looked up as he walked by . Snow, it screamed at him . Snow, snow . Then it opened its wings and flew away.Jon gathered up the empty cups and stepped outside . He heard distant laughter, the plaintive sound of pipes . A great blaze was crackling in the center of the camp, and he could smell stew cooking . The Old Bear might not be hungry, but Jon was . He drifted over toward the fire . [BOS] Sleep well, my lord . [EOS] Tormund snorted . It were Craster, or I ’ m a blushing maid . I told you, Mance, that creature needs to be shorter by a head.After them came the children . Little Rickon first, managing the long walk with all the dignity a three-year-old could muster . Jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit . Close behind came Robb, in grey wool trimmed with white, the Stark colors . He had the Princess Myrcella on his arm . She was a wisp of a girl, not quite eight, her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net . Jon noticed the shy looks she gave Robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him . He decided she was insipid . Robb didn ’ t even have the sense to realize how stupid she was; he was grinning like a fool.Mance Rayder smiled, as Jon had hoped he would . The king was plainly a man who liked the sound of his own voice . You will have heard stories of my desertion, I have no doubt.Jon was taken by surprise . [BOS] He told me his father was king, but not . . . I thought him perhaps a younger son . [EOS] King, croaked the raven . The bird flapped across the solar to land on Mormont ’ s shoulder . King, it said again, strutting back and forth.Aye, those three I recall . The lordling no older than one of these pups . Too proud to sleep under my roof, him in his sable cloak and black steel . My wives give him big cow eyes all the same . He turned his squint on the nearest of the women . Gared says they were chasing raiders . I told him, with a commander that green, best not catch ’ em . Gared wasn ’ t half-bad, for a crow . Had less ears than me, that one . The ’ bite took ’ em, same as mine . Craster laughed . Now I hear he got no head neither . The ’ bite do that too?Does he want me to say I love him? Jon ’ s voice was stiff and formal as he said, I am a man of the Night ’ s Watch.We ’ ve packed in our own supplies, my lord, said the Old Bear . We should be pleased to share our food and wine.Aye, a good crop of mildew, Dywen said . The best thing about a rain like this, it saves a man from taking baths . He made a clacking sound on his wooden teeth.It means I shall think on what you have said, the maester told him firmly . And now, I believe I am ready to sleep . Chett, show our young brother to the door.It is only a wood, Jon told himself, and they ’ re only dead men . He had seen dead men before …I will have these woods searched, Mormont commanded Ser Jaremy as they set out . Every tree, every rock, every bush, and every foot of muddy ground within ten leagues of here . Use all the men you have, and if you do not have enough, borrow hunters and foresters from the stewards . If Ben and the others are out here, dead or alive, I will have them found . And if there is anyone else in these woods, I will know of it . You are to track them and take them, alive if possible . Is that understood?It was too much . Jon frowned, incredulous . Are you afraid of everything? he asked . I don ’ t understand . If you are truly so craven, why are you here? Why would a coward want to join the Night ’ s Watch?The moon was rising behind one mountain and the sun sinking behind another as Jon struck sparks from flint and dagger, until finally a wisp of smoke appeared . Qhorin came and stood over him as the first flame rose up flickering from the shavings of bark and dead dry pine needles . As shy as a maid on her wedding night, the big ranger said in a soft voice, and near as fair . Sometimes a man forgets how pretty a fire can be.Afterward, she was almost shy, or as shy as Ygritte ever got . That thing you did, she said, when they lay together on their piled clothes . With your . . . mouth . She hesitated . Is that . . . is it what lords do to their ladies, down in the south?You don ’ t know what you ’ re asking, Jon . The Night ’ s Watch is a sworn brotherhood . We have no families . None of us will ever father sons . Our wife is duty . Our mistress is honor.Jon raised the hood of his heavy cloak and gave the horse her head . Castle Black was silent and still as he rode out, with Ghost racing at his side . Men watched from the Wall behind him, he knew, but their eyes were turned north, not south . No one would see him go, no one but Sam Tarly, struggling back to his feet in the dust of the old stables . He hoped Sam hadn ’ t hurt himself, falling like that . He was so heavy and so ungainly, it would be just like him to break a wrist or twist his ankle getting out of the way . Jon said aloud . [BOS] I warned him, It was nothing to do with him, anyway . [EOS] He flexed his burned hand as he rode, opening and closing the scarred fingers . They still pained him, but it felt good to have the wrappings off.The skinchanger was grey-faced, round-shouldered, and bald, a mouse of a man with a wolfling ’ s eyes . Once a horse is broken to the saddle, any man can mount him, he said in a soft voice . Once a beast ’ s been joined to a man, any skinchanger can slip inside and ride him . Orell was withering inside his feathers, so I took the eagle for my own . But the joining works both ways, warg . Orell lives inside me now, whispering how much he hates you . And I can soar above the Wall, and see with eagle eyes.The Magnar of Thenn studied Jon with his chilly grey eyes . We shall learn their numbers soon enough, he said after a moment . Go . I will send for you if I have further questions.Bael the Bard, said Jon, remembering the tale that Ygritte had told him in the Frostfangs, the night he ’ d almost killed her.Whitetree, the village was named on Sam ’ s old maps . Jon did not think it much of a village . Four tumbledown one-room houses of unmortared stone surrounded an empty sheepfold and a well . The houses were roofed with sod, the windows shuttered with ragged pieces of hide . And above them loomed the pale limbs and dark red leaves of a monstrous great weirwood.Dywen whapped him up alongside his ear with the back of his hand . You? Seen? You ’ re blind as Maester Aemon . You never even saw that bear.Jon told him, [BOS] You command Thenns, not free folk . [EOS] The King-beyond-the-Wall was doing all he could, yet the wildlings remained hopelessly undisciplined, and that made them vulnerable . Here and there within the leagues-long snake that was their line of march were warriors as fierce as any in the Watch, but a good third of them were grouped at either end of the column, in Harma Dogshead ’ s van and the savage rearguard with its giants, aurochs, and fire flingers . Another third rode with Mance himself near the center, guarding the wayns and sledges and dog carts that held the great bulk of the host ’ s provisions and supplies, all that remained of the last summer harvest . The rest, divided into small bands under the likes of Rattleshirt, Jarl, Tormund Giantsbane, and the Weeper, served as outriders, foragers, and whips, galloping up and down the column endlessly to keep it moving in a more or less orderly fashion.Your losses haven ’ t been that heavy.The Wall will stop them, Jon heard himself say . He turned and said it again, louder . The Wall will stop them . The Wall defends itself . Hollow words, but he needed to say them, almost as much as his brothers needed to hear them . Mance wants to unman us with his numbers . Does he think we ’ re stupid? He was shouting now, his leg forgotten, and every man was listening . The chariots, the horsemen, all those fools on foot . . . what are they going to do to us up here? Any of you ever see a mammoth climb a wall? He laughed, and Pyp and Owen and half a dozen more laughed with him . They ’ re nothing, they ’ re less use than our straw brothers here, they can ’ t reach us, they can ’ t hurt us, and they don ’ t frighten us, do they?Brave black crow, she mocked . Well, long before he was king over the free folk, Bael was a great raider.Something cold moved in her eyes . I told you to leave, she said . We don ’ t want you here.Your duty is here now, the Lord Commander reminded him . Your old life ended when you took the black . His bird made a raucous echo . Black . Mormont took no notice . Whatever they do in King ’ s Landing is none of our concern . When Jon did not answer, the old man finished his wine and said, You ’ re free to go . I ’ ll have no further need of you today . On the morrow you can help me write that letter.That, Rattleshirt seemed reluctant to do . His numbers meant little in the close confines of the rocks where the black brothers had taken their stand; to winkle them out of the cave the wildlings would need to come up two at a time . But another of his company edged a horse up beside him, one of the fighting women called spearwives . We are four-and-ten to two, crows, and eight dogs to your wolf, she called . Fight or run, you are ours.I will not scream, Jon told himself when he saw the blade glowing red hot . But he broke that vow as well . Donal Noye held him down, while Clydas helped guide the maester ’ s hand . Jon did not move, except to pound his fist against the table, again and again and again . The pain was so huge he felt small and weak and helpless inside it, a child whimpering in the dark . Ygritte, he thought, when the stench of burning flesh was in his nose and his own shriek echoing in her ears . Ygritte, I had to . For half a heartbeat the agony started to ebb . But then the iron touched him once again, and he fainted.Jon had to hold his tongue . He remembered the Skirling Pass all too well, and the moonlight climb he ’ d made with Stonesnake . He had swallowed his heart a half-dozen times that night, and by the end his arms and legs had been aching and his fingers were half frozen . And that was stone, not ice . Stone was solid . Ice was treacherous stuff at the best of times, and on a day like this, when the Wall was weeping, the warmth of a climber ’ s hand might be enough to melt it . The huge blocks could be frozen rock-hard inside, but their outer surface would be slick, with runnels of water trickling down, and patches of rotten ice where the air had gotten in . Whatever else the wildlings are, they ’ re brave.Once the barrel was on its side, Jon grabbed a torch and waved it above the surface of the Wall, back and forth, just enough to melt the ice a little . The thin film of water helped the barrel roll more easily . Too easily, in fact; they almost lost it . But finally, with four of them pooling their efforts, they rolled their boulder to the edge and stood it up again.Jon laughed, laughed like a drunk or a madman, and his men laughed with him . The chariots and the racing horsemen on the flanks were well ahead of the center now, he saw . The wildlings had not crossed a third of the half mile, yet their battle line was dissolving . Load the trebuchet with caltrops, Jon said . Owen, Kegs, angle the catapults toward the center . Scorpions, load with fire spears and loose at my command . He pointed at the Mole ’ s Town boys . You, you, and you, stand by with torches.Jon boasted . The wine was making him bold . He tried to sit very straight, to make himself seem taller . [BOS] I forget nothing, I want to serve in the Night ’ s Watch, Uncle . [EOS] Craster ’ s sheepskin jerkin and cloak of sewn skins made a shabby contrast, but around one thick wrist was a heavy ring that had the glint of gold . He looked to be a powerful man, though well into the winter of his days now, his mane of hair grey going to white . A flat nose and a drooping mouth gave him a cruel look, and one of his ears was missing . So this is a wildling . Jon remembered Old Nan ’ s tales of the savage folk who drank blood from human skulls . Craster seemed to be drinking a thin yellow beer from a chipped stone cup . Perhaps he had not heard the stories.Would you like to keep your eye, Jon? asked the King-beyond-the-Wall . If so, tell me how many they were . And try and speak the truth this time, Bastard of Winterfell.Promise? said Slynt . Well, promise may turn false . Qhorin Halfhand ’ s blood is on his hands . Mormont trusted him, you say, but what of that? I know what it is to be betrayed by men you trusted . Oh, yes . And I know the ways of wolves as well . He pointed at Jon ’ s face . Your father died a traitor.Red eyes, Jon realized, but not like Melisandre ’ s . He had a weirwood ’ s eyes . Red eyes, red mouth, white fur . Blood and bone, like a heart tree . He belongs to the old gods, this one . And he alone of all the direwolves was white . Six pups they ’ d found in the late summer snows, him and Robb; five that were grey and black and brown, for the five Starks, and one white, as white as Snow.Pyp grinned . We ’ re not all as dumb as Grenn.Jon was breaking his fast on applecakes and blood sausage when Samwell Tarly plopped himself down on the bench . I ’ ve been summoned to the sept, Sam said in an excited whisper . They ’ re passing me out of training . I ’ m to be made a brother with the rest of you . Can you believe it?Jon turned at the sudden sound of wings . Blue-grey feathers filled his eyes, as sharp talons buried themselves in his face . Red pain lanced through him sudden and fierce as pinions beat round his head . He saw the beak, but there was no time to get a hand up or reach for a weapon . Jon reeled backward, his foot lost the stirrup, his garron broke in panic, and then he was falling . And still the eagle clung to his face, its talons tearing at him as it flapped and shrieked and pecked . The world turned upside down in a chaos of feathers and horseflesh and blood, and then the ground came up to smash him.I ’ m to go to the stairs, Donal Noye says . I ’ m to go up to the third landing and shoot my crossbow down at the wildlings if they try to climb over the barrier . The third landing, one two three . His head bobbed up and down . If the wildlings attack, the king will come and help us, won ’ t he? He ’ s a mighty warrior, King Robert . He ’ s sure to come . Maester Aemon sent him a bird.Qhorin Halfhand gazed at him across the fire, his eyes lost in pools of shadow . When I see him next . I swear it . He gestured at the fire . More wood . I want it bright and hot.It wasn ’ t Longspear, then? Jon was relieved . He liked Longspear, with his homely face and friendly ways.The big spearwife narrowed her eyes and said, If the crow would join the free folk, let him show us his prowess and prove the truth of him.Enough, Qhorin said abruptly . Now we ride.Jon nodded . He should have come straight from the stable . He climbed the tower steps briskly . He wants wine or a fire in his hearth, that ’ s all, he told himself.There was no time to think or plan or shout for help . Jon dropped his bow, reached back over his shoulder, ripped Longclaw from its sheath, and buried the blade in the middle of the first head to pop out of the tower . Bronze was no match for Valyrian steel . The blow sheared right through the Thenn ’ s helm and deep into his skull, and he went crashing back down where he ’ d come from . There were more behind him, Jon knew from the shouting . He fell back and called to Satin . The next man to make the climb got a quarrel through his cheek . He vanished too . The oil, Jon said . Satin nodded . Together they snatched up the thick quilted pads they ’ d left beside the fire, lifted the heavy kettle of boiling oil, and dumped it down the hole on the Thenns below . The shrieks were as bad as anything he had ever heard, and Satin looked as though he was going to be sick . Jon kicked the trapdoor shut, set the heavy iron kettle on top of it, and gave the boy with the pretty face a hard shake . Retch later, Jon yelled . Come.What is it, man? Mormont said gruffly.Command it? But . . .Jon said, too quickly . It was Winterfell the king was speaking of, and Winterfell was not to be lightly refused . [BOS] No, I mean . . . this has all come very suddenly, Your Grace . Might I beg you for some time to consider? [EOS] When they entered the grove, Samwell Tarly turned slowly looking at each face in turn . No two were quite alike . They ’ re watching us, he whispered . The old gods.Rise . I have heard much and more of you, Lord Snow.Jon handed Sam the roll of parchment . [BOS] Bones, ashes, and empty houses . The Old Bear wants word sent back to Aemon . [EOS] Jon shouted, sitting up . He could still feel the talons, the pain . [BOS] Ghost! Ghost, to me! [EOS] All night they rode, feeling their way up the twisting pass and through the stretches of broken ground . The wind grew stronger . Sometimes it was so dark that they dismounted and went ahead on foot, each man leading his garron . Once Ebben suggested that some torches might serve them well, but Qhorin said, No fire, and that was the end of that . They reached the stone bridge at the summit and began to descend again . Off in the darkness a shadowcat screamed in fury, its voice bouncing off the rocks so it seemed as though a dozen other ’ cats were giving answer . Once Jon thought he saw a pair of glowing eyes on a ledge overhead, as big as harvest moons.I won ’ t keep you from the Old Bear . Noye clapped him on the shoulder and smiled . May the gods go with you on the morrow, Snow . You bring back that uncle of yours, you hear?He almost rode through Mole ’ s Town, so feverish that he did not know where he was . Most of the village was hidden underground, only a handful of small hovels to be seen by the light of the waning moon . The brothel was a shed no bigger than a privy, its red lantern creaking in the wind, a bloodshot eye peering through the blackness . Jon dismounted at the adjoining stable, half-stumbling from the mare ’ s back as he shouted two boys awake . I need a fresh mount, with saddle and bridle, he told them, in a tone that brooked no argument . They brought him that; a skin of wine as well, and half a loaf of brown bread . Wake the village, he told them . Warn them . There are wildlings south of the Wall . Gather your goods and make for Castle Black . He pulled himself onto the black gelding they ’ d given him, gritting his teeth at the pain in his leg, and rode hard for the north.Craven or not, Samwell Tarly had found the courage to accept his fate like a man . On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns, Benjen Stark had said the last night Jon had seen him alive . You ’ re no ranger, Jon, only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you . He ’ d heard it said that bastards grow up faster than other children; on the Wall, you grew up or you died.Jon peeled off his glove and showed them his burned hand . [BOS] I burned my hand defending Lord Mormont from a wight . And my uncle was a man of honor . He would never have betrayed his vows . [EOS] A grim day . Jon Snow wrapped gloved hands around the bars and held tight as the wind hammered at the cage once more . When he looked straight down past his feet, the ground was lost in shadow, as if he were being lowered into some bottomless pit . Well, death is a bottomless pit of sorts, he reflected, and when this day ’ s work is done my name will be shadowed forever.Then Lord Eddard is a man in ten thousand . Most of us are not so strong . What is honor compared to a woman ’ s love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms … or the memory of a brother ’ s smile? Wind and words . Wind and words . We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love . That is our great glory, and our great tragedy.The direwolf wrenched free and came to him as the wight struggled to rise, dark snakes spilling from the great wound in its belly . Jon plunged his hand into the flames, grabbed a fistful of the burning drapes, and whipped them at the dead man . Let it burn, he prayed as the cloth smothered the corpse, gods, please, please, let it burn.Jon said . [BOS] A direwolf, His name is Ghost . The direwolf is the sigil of my father ’ s House . [EOS] Inside the sept, the great crystal caught the morning light as it streamed through the south-facing window and spread it in a rainbow on the altar . Pyp ’ s mouth dropped open when he caught sight of Sam, and Toad poked Grenn in the ribs, but no one dared say a word . Septon Celladar was swinging a censer, filling the air with fragrant incense that reminded Jon of Lady Stark ’ s little sept in Winterfell . For once the septon seemed sober.Ghost ate well that day, and Qhorin insisted that the rangers mix some of the garron ’ s blood with their oats, to give them strength . The taste of that foul porridge almost choked Jon, but he forced it down . They each cut a dozen strips of raw stringy meat from the carcass to chew on as they rode, and left the rest for the shadowcats.He turned his back on the man . No.Then you must send scouts into the mountains.I had a direwolf, Ghost . I left him when I climbed the Wall near Greyguard, and have not seen him since . Qhorin Halfhand commanded me to join the wildlings . He knew they would make me kill him to prove myself, and told me to do whatever they asked of me . The woman was named Ygritte . I broke my vows with her, but I swear to you on my father ’ s name that I never turned my cloak.Jarl laughed, and even Harma Dogshead smirked . Is that the way of it, Jon Snow? asked Mance Rayder, mildly . Her and you?Septon Cellador cleared his throat . Lord Slynt, he said, this boy refused to swear his vows properly in the sept, but went beyond the Wall to say his words before a heart tree . His father ’ s gods, he said, but they are wildling gods as well.They ’ ll cut off your head if they catch you, you know, Toad put in with a nervous laugh . This is so stupid, it ’ s like something the Aurochs would do.If it ’ s softer than the ground and has a roof over it, I call it a bed . Dolorous Edd sniffed the air . I smell dung.To crows I be the Lord o ’ Bones . The rider ’ s helm was made from the broken skull of a giant, and all up and down his arms bearclaws had been sewn to his boiled leather.You ’ re the one who named me Lord Snow, said Jon . Ser Alliser had been fond of naming the boys he trained, during his time as Castle Black ’ s master-at-arms . The Old Bear had sent Thorne to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea . These others must be Eastwatch men . The bird reached Cotter Pyke and he ’ s sent us help . How many men have you brought? he asked the man behind the table.He might still be alive, said Pyp . He might surprise us all and come riding up tomorrow.We ’ ll press on north, Mormont decided . If we reach this lake, we can make camp by the shore, perchance catch a few fish . Jon, fetch me paper, it ’ s past time I wrote Maester Aemon.A warhorn, a bloody great warhorn.Jon told him, keeping his voice low so the others would not hear . [BOS] You have to look, Maester Aemon sent you to be his eyes, didn ’ t he? What good are eyes if they ’ re shut? [EOS] Oh, hundreds, she said furiously . You know nothing, Jon Snow . You—JON!Wildlings have invaded the realm before . Jon had heard the tales from Old Nan and Maester Luwin both, back at Winterfell . Raymun Redbeard led them south in the time of my grandfather ’ s grandfather, and before him there was a king named Bael the Bard.Ygritte rode just behind him . In front was Longspear Ryk . The Lord of Bones had made the two of them his guards . If the crow flies, I ’ ll boil your bones as well, he warned them when they had set out, smiling through the crooked teeth of the giant ’ s skull he wore for a helm.She flinched . An evil name.Ghost bared his teeth, but Jon put a hand on his head . My lord, he said, will you tell me what ’ s happened here?Jon repeated when Tormund handed him back the skin . He drank even deeper . [BOS] To Ygritte, kissed by fire, [EOS] Jon ’ s breath went out of him as the fallen table caught him between his shoulder blades . The sword, where was the sword? He ’ d lost the damned sword! When he opened his mouth to scream, the wight jammed its black corpse fingers into Jon ’ s mouth . Gagging, he tried to shove it off, but the dead man was too heavy . Its hand forced itself farther down his throat, icy cold, choking him . Its face was against his own, filling the world . Frost covered its eyes, sparkling blue . Jon raked cold flesh with his nails and kicked at the thing ’ s legs . He tried to bite, tried to punch, tried to breathe …In the dark, the direwolf ’ s red eyes looked black . He nuzzled at Jon ’ s neck, silent as ever, his breath a hot mist . The wildlings called Jon Snow a warg, but if so he was a poor one . He did not know how to put on a wolf skin, the way Orell had with his eagle before he ’ d died . Once Jon had dreamed that he was Ghost, looking down upon the valley of the Milkwater where Mance Rayder had gathered his people, and that dream had turned out to be true . But he was not dreaming now, and that left him only words.They died or went away . Brandon ’ s Gift had been farmed for thousands of years, but as the Watch dwindled there were fewer hands to plow the fields, tend the bees, and plant the orchards, so the wild had reclaimed many a field and hall . In the New Gift there had been villages and holdfasts whose taxes, rendered in goods and labor, helped feed and clothe the black brothers . But those were largely gone as well.Tormund Crowlover, Harma sneered . You are a great sack o ’ wind, old man.I would not, Grenn said . I ’ m no oathbreaker . I said the words and I meant them.Jon said bitterly . [BOS] You don ’ t know, No one knows . Even if I am his bastard, he ’ s still my father … [EOS] Yes . Donal was the last . Noye ’ s sword was sunk deep in the giant ’ s throat, halfway to the hilt . The armorer had always seemed such a big man to Jon, but locked in the giant ’ s massive arms he looked almost like a child . The giant crushed his spine . I don ’ t know who died first . He took the lantern and moved forward for a better look . Mag . I am the last of the giants . He could feel the sadness there, but he had no time for sadness . It was Mag the Mighty . The king of the giants.The huge carcass of a dead mammoth partially blocked the way . One of the beast ’ s tusks snagged his cloak and tore it as he edged past . Three more giants lay outside, half buried beneath stone and slush and hardened pitch . He could see where the fire had melted the Wall, where great sheets of ice had come sloughing off in the heat to shatter on the blackened ground . He looked up at where they ’ d come from . When you stand here it seems immense, as if it were about to crush you.No, Maester Aemon said, from the back of the sept. Clydas helped him stand . We took you for a man of Night ’ s Watch … but perhaps we were wrong in that.Mormont ’ s eyes flicked from Sam to Jon and back again . If the lad has something to say, I ’ ll hear him out . Come closer, boy . We can ’ t see you behind those horses.Girls don ’ t shave, Arya said.Bael the Bard made it, said Ygritte . He was King-beyond-the-Wall a long time back . All the free folk know his songs, but might be you don ’ t sing them in the south.I was with them . Qhorin Halfhand commanded me to join them . Jon winced as the maester ’ s finger explored his wound, poking and prodding . The Magnar of Thenn—aaaaah, that hurts . He clenched his teeth . Where is the Old Bear?Jon shrugged . [BOS] It changes . I ’ ve heard that Lord Commander Qorgyle used to send them out every third day from Castle Black to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, and every second day from Castle Black to the Shadow Tower . The Watch had more men in his day, though . Lord Commander Mormont prefers to vary the number of patrols and the days of their departure, to make it more difficult for anyone to know their comings and goings . And sometimes the Old Bear will even send a larger force to one of the abandoned castles for a fortnight or a moon ’ s turn . [EOS] His uncle had originated that tactic, Jon knew . Anything to make the enemy unsure.Jon had joined the wildlings at Qhorin Halfhand ’ s command . Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them, the ranger had told him, the night before he died . And watch . But all his watching had learned him little . The Halfhand had suspected that the wildlings had gone up into the bleak and barren Frostfangs in search of some weapon, some power, some fell sorcery with which to break the Wall . . . but if they had found any such, no one was boasting of it openly, or showing it to Jon . Nor had Mance Rayder confided any of his plans or strategies . Since that first night, he had hardly seen the man save at a distance.Longspear, watch the beast . Rattleshirt yanked open the tent and gestured Jon and Ygritte inside.Jon smiled . [BOS] He wants an axe . And wine as well . [EOS] Jon said hotly . [BOS] I don ’ t care about that! [EOS] What, me as well? said Tormund.He watched the wildling move carefully from wood to Wall, hacking out a handhold with short sharp blows of his ice axe, then swinging over . The rope around his waist tied him to the second man in line, still edging up the tree . Step by slow step, Jarl moved higher, kicking out toeholds with his spiked boots when there were no natural ones to be found . When he was ten feet above the sentinel, he stopped upon a narrow icy ledge, slung his axe from his belt, took out his hammer, and drove an iron stake into a cleft . The second man moved onto the Wall behind him while the third was scrambling to the top of the tree.Jon tried to sound confident . [BOS] The worst is behind us . Don ’ t be frightened . [EOS] He tried to put an arm around her.But when they emerged back into the light long hours later, the eagle was waiting for them, perched on a dead tree a hundred feet up the slope . Ghost went bounding up the rocks after it, but the bird flapped its wings and took to the air.Even so.Halder gave an apologetic shrug . I helped Pate carve the stone for the pommel, the builder said, and your friend Sam bought the garnets in Mole ’ s Town.No, but—You said—Sam nodded miserably . I hate the cold, he said . Last night I woke up in the dark and the fire had gone out and I was certain I was going to freeze to death by morning.I wanted to, truly . I just … I couldn ’ t . I didn ’ t want him to hit me anymore . He looked at the ground . I … I fear I ’ m a coward . My lord father always said so.It ’ s not like him to miss a meal, Pyp said thoughtfully . Do you suppose he ’ s taken ill?The wind was blowing briskly when he left . By morning, frost would cover the ground, and the tent ropes would be stiff and frozen . A few fingers of spiced wine sloshed in the bottom of the kettle . Jon fed fresh wood to the fire and put the kettle over the flames to reheat . He flexed his fingers as he waited, squeezing and spreading until the hand tingled . The first watch had taken up their stations around the perimeter of the camp . Torches flickered all along the ringwall . The night was moonless, but a thousand stars shone overhead.How long ago was this?Samwell Tarly looked at him for a long moment, and his round face seemed to cave in on itself . He sat down on the frost-covered ground and began to cry, huge choking sobs that made his whole body shake . Jon Snow could only stand and watch . Like the snowfall on the barrowlands, it seemed the tears would never end.Grenn ’ s the ugly one, Pyp said.Your head ’ s as wooden as your teeth, Hake told him . There ’ s no smell to cold.I see . His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall . My brother does not seem very festive tonight.In an open space surrounded by tall green soldier pines, Rattleshirt dismounted . We ’ ll make camp here, he told Lenyl and Ragwyle and the others . Feed the horses, then the dogs, then yourself . Ygritte, Longspear, bring the crow so Mance can have his look . We ’ ll gut him after.Jon promised, [BOS] He will be, unless you help . [EOS] I see that . Best come along, then . You want to ride?Aerion the Monstrous? Jon knew that name . The Prince Who Thought He Was a Dragon was one of Old Nan ’ s more gruesome tales . His little brother Bran had loved it.The Old Bear is taking two hundred seasoned men, three-quarters of them rangers . Qhorin Halfhand will be bringing another hundred brothers from the Shadow Tower . You ’ ll be as safe as if you were back in your lord father ’ s castle at Horn Hill.Old Lord Crow, him with the talking bird, he gave Craster a crossbow worth a hundred rabbits . Her arms closed over the swell of her belly . Is it true, m ’ lord? Are you brother to a king?A woman of the free folk . How could he explain Ygritte to them? She ’ s warm and smart and funny and she can kiss a man or slit his throat . She ’ s with Styr, but she ’ s not . . . she ’ s young, only a girl, in truth, wild, but she . . . She killed an old man for building a fire . His tongue felt thick and clumsy . The milk of the poppy was clouding his wits . I broke my vows with her . I never meant to, but . . . It was wrong . Wrong to love her, wrong to leave her . . . I wasn ’ t strong enough . The Halfhand commanded me, ride with them, watch, I must not balk, I . . . His head felt as if it were packed with wet wool.They would shame us into folly . Qhorin gave Jon a long look . Remember your orders.Even his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world . Up here, the genial Benjen Stark he had known became a different person . He was First Ranger, and he spent his days and nights with Lord Commander Mormont and Maester Aemon and the other high officers, while Jon was given over to the less than tender charge of Ser Alliser Thorne.Jon admitted . His arm burned from the weight of the longsword, and he was starting to feel his bruises now that the fight was done . [BOS] I ’ m tired, [EOS] Iron Emmett pulled his battered helm off . Was there some part of yield you could not comprehend, Lord Snow? It was said amiably, though . Emmett was an amiable man, and he loved the song of swords . Warrior defend me, he groaned, now I know how Qhorin Halfhand must have felt.The very one, though he named himself Aerion Brightflame . One night, in his cups, he drank a jar of wildfire, after telling his friends it would transform him into a dragon, but the gods were kind and it transformed him into a corpse . Not quite a year after, King Maekar died in battle against an outlaw lord.They had descended the south face of the Wall at Greyguard, abandoned for two hundred years . A section of the huge stone steps had collapsed a century before, but even so the descent was a good deal easier than the climb . From there Styr marched them deep into the Gift, to avoid the Watch ’ s customary patrols . Grigg the Goat led them past the few inhabited villages that remained in these lands . Aside from a few scattered roundtowers poking the sky like stone fingers, they saw no sign of man . Through cold wet hills and windy plains they marched, unwatched, unseen.He led the mare off the road, behind a thick stand of grey-green sentinels . Quiet now, he said in a hushed voice, crouching down to peer through the branches . If the gods were kind, the riders would pass by . Likely as not, they were only smallfolk from Mole ’ s Town, farmers on their way to their fields, although what they were doing out in the middle of the night …Mance is not here, said Rattleshirt . Ragwyle, gut him.He is giving me his son ’ s sword . Jon could scarcely believe it . The blade was exquisitely balanced . The edges glimmered faintly as they kissed the light . Your son—Yet Lord Commander Mormont gave a snort . If Ben Stark had come under Wildling attack a half day ’ s ride from Castle Black, he would have returned for more men, chased the killers through all seven hells and brought me back their heads.Yes, my lord, but—Jon slid his new dagger from its sheath and studied the flames as they played against the shiny black glass . He had fashioned the wooden hilt himself, and wound hempen twine around it to make a grip . Ugly, but it served . Dolorous Edd opined that glass knives were about as useful as nipples on a knight ’ s breastplate, but Jon was not so certain . The dragonglass blade was sharper than steel, albeit far more brittle.See, the Old Bear ’ s clever . If we get the wildling well and truly drunk, perhaps he ’ ll only cut off an ear when he tries to slay us with that axe . I have two ears but only one head.Jon shouted back, a black arrow in his hand . [BOS] We kill them, [EOS] Was there anything in Whitetree?You, and others.Yet even so, Jon Snow was not sorry he had come . There were wonders here as well . He had seen sunlight flashing on icy thin waterfalls as they plunged over the lips of sheer stone cliffs, and a mountain meadow full of autumn wildflowers, blue coldsnaps and bright scarlet frostfires and stands of piper ’ s grass in russet and gold . He had peered down ravines so deep and black they seemed certain to end in some hell, and he had ridden his garron over a wind-eaten bridge of natural stone with nothing but sky to either side . Eagles nested in the heights and came down to hunt the valleys, circling effortlessly on great blue-grey wings that seemed almost part of the sky . Once he had watched a shadowcat stalk a ram, flowing down the mountainside like liquid smoke until it was ready to pounce.The big ranger looked to Jon . We have no food to feed her, nor can we spare a man to watch her.He had never thought to find a stone castle on the far side of the Wall, but he had pictured some sort of motte-and-bailey with a wooden palisade and a timber tower keep . What they found instead was a midden heap, a pigsty, an empty sheepfold, and a windowless daub-and-wattle hall scarce worthy of the name . It was long and low, chinked together from logs and roofed with sod . The compound stood atop a rise too modest to name a hill, surrounded by an earthen dike . Brown rivulets flowed down the slope where the rain had eaten gaping holes in the defenses, to join a rushing brook that curved around to the north, its thick waters turned into a murky torrent by the rains.Three-quarters of the village had taken Jon ’ s warning to heart and come to Castle Black for refuge . Noye had decreed that every man still spry enough to hold a spear or swing an axe would help defend the barricade, else they could damn well go home and take their chances with the Thenns . He had emptied the armory to put good steel in their hands; big double-bladed axes, razor-sharp daggers, longswords, maces, spiked morningstars . Clad in studded leather jerkins and mail hauberks, with greaves for their legs and gorgets to keep their heads on their shoulders, a few of them even looked like soldiers . In a bad light . If you squint.I belong with my brother.Ghost backed away from the door . There were deep gouges where he ’ d raked the wood . Jon watched him with mounting disquiet . There ’ s someone out there, isn ’ t there? he whispered . Crouching, the direwolf crept backward, white fur rising on the back of his neck . The guard, he thought, they left a man to guard my door, Ghost smells him through the door, that ’ s all it is.The last few moles were still making the long climb, Jon saw, urged on by his brothers . Grenn was carrying a little boy in his arms, while Pyp, two flights below, let an old man lean upon his shoulder . The oldest villagers still waited below for the cage to make its way back down to them . He saw a mother pulling along two children, one on either hand, as an older boy ran past her up the steps . Two hundred feet above them, Sky Blue Su and Lady Meliana (who was no lady, all her friends agreed) stood on a landing, looking south . They had a better view of the smoke than he did, no doubt . Jon wondered about the villagers who had chosen not to flee . There were always a few, too stubborn or too stupid or too brave to run, a few who preferred to fight or hide or bend the knee . Maybe the Thenns would spare them.Bran, he said, I ’ m sorry I didn ’ t come before . I was afraid . He could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks . Jon no longer cared . Don ’ t die, Bran . Please . We ’ re all waiting for you to wake up . Me and Robb and the girls, everyone …There were times—not many, but a few—when Jon Snow was glad he was a bastard . As he filled his wine cup once more from a passing flagon, it struck him that this might be one of them.The Magnar shouted commands in the Old Tongue and a score of his Thenns spread out to establish a perimeter around the village, whilst others went prowling through the houses to make certain no one else was hiding amongst the weeds and tumbled stones . The rest crowded into the roofless inn, jostling each other to get closer to the hearth . The broken branches the old man had been burning seemed to generate more smoke than heat, but any warmth was welcome on such a wild rainy night . Two of the Thenns had thrown the man to the ground and were going through his things . Another held his horse, while three more looted his saddlebags.Your Bael was a liar, he told her, certain now.Arya gave him a whap on the arm with the flat of her blade . The blow stung, but Jon found himself grinning like an idiot . I know which end to use, Arya said . A doubtful look crossed her face . Septa Mordane will take it away from me.We shouldn ’ t—She told me Mance would take me, if I ran with her.M ’ lord, Janos Slynt reminded him . You ’ ll address me—Jon got the horses fed before he stopped to think of his own supper . He was wondering where to find Sam when he heard a shout of fear . Wolf! He sprinted around the hall toward the cry, the earth sucking at his boots . One of Craster ’ s women was backed up against the mud-spattered wall of the keep . Keep away, she was shouting at Ghost . You keep away! The direwolf had a rabbit in his mouth and another dead and bloody on the ground before him . Get it away, m ’ lord, she pleaded when she saw him.Jon was using the word in its older sense, I think, Maester Aemon said, not as a family name but as a title . It derives from the Old Tongue.Jon could feel himself turning red again . [BOS] She spoke for me when Rattleshirt would have killed me . I would not dishonor her . [EOS] I know one thing . I know that you are wildling to the bone . It was easy to forget that sometimes, when they were laughing together, or kissing . But then one of them would say something, or do something, and he would suddenly be reminded of the wall between their worlds.Jon did not think sleep would come easily, but he knew the Halfhand was right . He found a place out of the wind, beneath an overhang of rock, and took off his cloak to use it for a blanket . Ghost, he called . Here . To me . He always slept better with the great white wolf beside him; there was comfort in the smell of him, and welcome warmth in that shaggy pale fur . This time, though, Ghost did no more than look at him . Then he turned away and padded around the garrons, and quick as that he was gone . He wants to hunt, Jon thought . Perhaps there were goats in these mountains . The shadowcats must live on something . Just don ’ t try and bring down a ’ cat, he muttered . Even for a direwolf, that would be dangerous . He tugged his cloak over him and stretched out beneath the rock.Stupidly, Jon argued . I ’ ll be fifteen on my name day, he said . Almost a man grown.Well, don ’ t bother copying that one . Twenty-three barrels of pickled cod, eighteen jars of fish oil, a cask of salt . . .Which king?I remember, said Jon with a startled laugh . A young black brother on the wallwalk, yes . . . You swore not to tell.… certain he came this way?Jon was not entirely innocent of the history of the realm; his own maester had seen to that . That was the year of the Great Council, he said . The lords passed over Prince Aerion ’ s infant son and Prince Daeron ’ s daughter and gave the crown to Aegon.Yellow, she said . Is that what you meant? Some o ’ them standing stones on top were yellow.I didn ’ t see any men . Just Craster and his women and a few small girls . I wonder he ’ s able to hold the place . His defenses were nothing to speak of, only a muddy dike . You had better go up to the hall and draw that map . Can you find the way?I ’ ve got your similar aroma right here . Hake patted his dirk . Grumbling, he filled Jon ’ s bowl from the kettle.A one-armed smith slew Mag the Mighty? Har! That must o ’ been a fight to see . Mance will make a song of it, see if he don ’ t. Tormund took a waterskin off his saddle and pulled the cork . This will warm us some . To Donal Noye, and Mag the Mighty . He took a swing, and handed it down to Jon.There are still direwolves beyond the Wall . We hear them on our rangings . Benjen Stark gave Jon a long look . Don ’ t you usually eat at table with your brothers?Some say it was for a crown . Some say for a woman . Others that you had the wildling blood.Jarl soon had his men edging upward again . His four and Grigg ’ s moved almost side by side, with Errok ’ s fifty feet below . Deerhorn axes chopped and hacked, sending showers of glittery shards cascading down onto the trees . Stone hammers pounded stakes deep into the ice to serve as anchors for the ropes; the iron stakes ran out before they were halfway up, and after that the climbers used horn and sharpened bone . And the men kicked, driving the spikes on their boots against the hard unyielding ice again and again and again and again to make one foothold . Their legs must be numb, Jon thought by the fourth hour . How long can they keep on with that? He watched as restless as the Magnar, listening for the distant moan of a Thenn warhorn . But the horns stayed silent, and there was no sign of the Night ’ s Watch.I know, said Sam guiltily, but she was afraid . I know what it is to be afraid . I told her . . . He swallowed.Be gentle . Sam came around the table and took the scroll from his hand, holding it as if it were a wounded animal . The important books used to be copied over when they needed them . Some of the oldest have been copied half a hundred times, probably.Something was coming up the hill behind him, he realized suddenly . For half a heartbeat he thought it might be Ghost come back, but the direwolf never made so much noise . Jon drew Longclaw in a single smooth motion, but it was only one of the Thenns, a broad man in a bronze helm . Snow, the intruder said . Come . Magnar wants . The men of Thenn spoke the Old Tongue, and most had only a few words of the Common.Sometimes I dream about it, he said . I ’ m walking down this long empty hall . My voice echoes all around, but no one answers, so I walk faster, opening doors, shouting names . I don ’ t even know who I ’ m looking for . Most nights it ’ s my father, but sometimes it ’ s Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my uncle . The thought of Benjen Stark saddened him; his uncle was still missing . The Old Bear had sent out rangers in search of him . Ser Jaremy Rykker had led two sweeps, and Quorin Halfhand had gone forth from the Shadow Tower, but they ’ d found nothing aside from a few blazes in the trees that his uncle had left to mark his way . In the stony highlands to the northwest, the marks stopped abruptly and all trace of Ben Stark vanished.One against seven? Halder gave a signal . The boys spread out, surrounding him.She ’ s my own blood, said Tormund proudly . She broke his lip for him and bit one ear half off, and I hear he ’ s got so many scratches on his back he can ’ t wear a cloak . She likes him well enough, though . And why not? He don ’ t fight with no spear, you know . Never has . So where do you think he got that name? Har!I won.And even more telling, only one in a hundred wildlings was mounted . The Old Bear will go through them like an axe through porridge . And when that happened, Mance must give chase with his center, to try and blunt the threat . If he should fall in the fight that must follow, the Wall would be safe for another hundred years, Jon judged . And if not . . .Did you know him, my lord?Did you hear that? Noye asked.I have need of every man who knows which end of the spear to stab into the wildlings.Ser Endrew Tarth, a good man . He ’ s on his way from the Shadow Tower to assume the duties of master-at-arms . Ser Alliser Thorne left yestermorn for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.There was no doubting which tent was the king ’ s . It was thrice the size of the next largest he ’ d seen, and he could hear music drifting from within . Like many of the lesser tents it was made of sewn hides with the fur still on, but Mance Rayder ’ s hides were the shaggy white pelts of snow bears . The peaked roof was crowned with a huge set of antlers from one of the giant elks that had once roamed freely throughout the Seven Kingdoms, in the times of the First Men.A silence fell over the wood . For a moment all they heard was Sam ’ s heavy breathing and the wet sound of Dywen sucking on his teeth . Jon squatted beside Ghost.But the Dornishman ’ s blade was made of black steel,The old gods will be expecting us . He made himself smile.Only a dozen? Two hundred men had left Castle Black with Lord Commander Mormont, two hundred of the Watch ’ s best . Does this mean Marsh is Lord Commander, then? The Old Pomegranate was amiable, and a diligent First Steward, but he was woefully ill-suited to face a wildling host.Aye, she said, but the gods hate kinslayers, even when they kill unknowing . When Lord Stark returned from the battle and his mother saw Bael ’ s head upon his spear, she threw herself from a tower in her grief . Her son did not long outlive her . One o ’ his lords peeled the skin off him and wore him for a cloak.He did not have to search for targets now; only choose them . He dropped a wildling archer as he was fitting an arrow to his string, then sent a shaft toward the axeman hacking at the door of Hardin ’ s Tower . That time he missed, but the arrow quivering in the oak made the wildling reconsider . It was only as he was running off that Jon recognized Big Boil . Half a heartbeat later, old Mully put an arrow through his leg from the roof of the Flint Barracks, and he crawled off bleeding . That will stop him bitching about his boil, Jon thought.You do . I want you rested . Go on, I ’ m not going to let you sleep through the fight . He made himself smile . You ’ re the only one who can move those bloody barrels.Sit, if you like, Rayder said when they were gone . Are you hungry? Tormund left us two birds at least.The others laughed, and even Jon had to smile . The fire he ’ d started had not, in truth, burned down that formidable stone tower, but it had done a fair job of gutting the interior of the top two floors, where the Old Bear had his chambers . No one seemed to mind that very much, since it had also destroyed Othor ’ s murderous corpse.Tormund ’ s sons Toregg and Dormund added their deep voices as well, then his daughter Munda and all the rest . Others began to bang their spears on leathern shields to keep rough time, until the whole war band was singing as they rode.Would that I knew, said Qhorin . Your wolf saw their diggings in the valley of the Milkwater . What did they seek, in such a bleak and distant place? Did they find it? That is what you must learn, before you return to Lord Mormont and your brothers . That is the duty I lay on you, Jon Snow.He ought to have passed here last year, said Thoren Smallwood . A dog came sniffing round his leg . He kicked it and sent it off yipping.So the son slew the father instead, said Jon.The Eastwatch men threw the captive roughly to the floor . Lord Slynt frowned down at him . Is this the one you spoke of?Makes you wonder what lies beyond, a familiar voice said.She wiped her hands on her skirt . M ’ lord—Terms? Ser Alliser chuckled.No . Jon had not thought of it that way.Pull up, Grenn said . You can ’ t outrun us all.Jon nodded weakly . The door swung open . Pyp led them in, followed by Clydas and the lantern . It was all Jon could do to keep up with Maester Aemon . The ice pressed close around them, and he could feel the cold seeping into his bones, the weight of the Wall above his head . It felt like walking down the gullet of an ice dragon . The tunnel took a twist, and then another . Pyp unlocked a second iron gate . They walked farther, turned again, and saw light ahead, faint and pale through the ice . That ’ s bad, Jon knew at once . That ’ s very bad.They … they aren ’ t rotting . Sam pointed, his fat finger shaking only a little . Look, there ’ s … there ’ s no maggots or … or … worms or anything … they ’ ve been lying here in the woods, but they … they haven ’ t been chewed or eaten by animals … only Ghost … otherwise they ’ re … they ’ re …They ’ ll move . Rattleshirt ’ s voice was thick and angry.But once the Wall is fallen, Dalla said, what will stop the Others?Maester Aemon sighed . Have you heard nothing I ’ ve told you, Jon? Do you think you are the first? He shook his ancient head, a gesture weary beyond words . Three times the gods saw fit to test my vows . Once when I was a boy, once in the fullness of my manhood, and once when I had grown old . By then my strength was fled, my eyes grown dim, yet that last choice was as cruel as the first . My ravens would bring the news from the south, words darker than their wings, the ruin of my House, the death of my kin, disgrace and desolation . What could I have done, old, blind, frail? I was helpless as a suckling babe, yet still it grieved me to sit forgotten as they cut down my brother ’ s poor grandson, and his son, and even the little children …How does he feed all his men?You are a free man now, and Ygritte is a free woman . What dishonor if you lay together?Across the lake, the tower was black again, a dim shape dimly seen . A queen lived there? asked Ygritte.Then you must do what needs be done, Qhorin Halfhand said . You are the blood of Winterfell and a man of the Night ’ s Watch . He looked at the others . Come, brothers . Leave him to it . It will go easier for him if we do not watch . And he led them up the steep twisting trail toward the pale pink glow of the sun where it broke through a mountain cleft, and before very long only Jon and Ghost remained with the wildling girl.Out of the corner of his eye, Jon glimpsed a pale shape moving through the trees . Leaves rustled, and Ghost came bounding out of the shadows, so suddenly that Jon ’ s mare started and gave a whinny . There! Halder shouted.As you wish . Mormont lifted the flap of the tent and Qhorin Halfhand stooped and stepped through.Maybe we ’ ll break you, one of the rapers said.Do you know the difference between a wildling who ’ s a friend to the Watch and one who ’ s not? asked the dour squire . Our enemies leave our bodies for the crows and the wolves . Our friends bury us in secret graves . I wonder how long that bear ’ s been nailed up on that gate, and what Craster had there before we came hallooing? Edd looked at the axe doubtfully, the rain running down his long face . Is it dry in there?Queen Alysanne, you say?Ygritte had looked so angry he thought she was about to strike him . All of us, she said . You too . You ’ re no crow now, Jon Snow . I swore you weren ’ t, so you better not be . She pushed him back against the trunk of a tree and kissed him, full on the lips right there in the midst of the ragged column . Jon heard Grigg the Goat urging her on . Someone else laughed . He kissed her back despite all that . When they finally broke apart, Ygritte was flushed . You ’ re mine, she whispered . Mine, as I ’ m yours . And if we die, we die . All men must die, Jon Snow . But first we ’ ll live.Donal Noye crossed the room and shoved Jon back onto his back . Be still, or I ’ ll tie you down . Even with only one arm, the smith handled him as if he were a child . Clydas returned with a green flask and a rounded stone cup . Maester Aemon poured it full . Drink this.The Old Bear tapped the letter with a finger . Your father and the king, he rumbled . I won ’ t lie to you, it ’ s grievous news . I never thought to see another king, not at my age, with Robert half my years and strong as a bull . He took a gulp of wine . They say the king loved to hunt . The things we love destroy us every time, lad . Remember that . My son loved that young wife of his . Vain woman . If not for her, he would never have thought to sell those poachers.We want to take you back where you belong, Pyp said.Don ’ t you dare! Sam pulled up the hood of his enormous black cloak and clambered awkwardly back onto his horse . It was a plow horse, big and slow and clumsy, but better able to bear his weight than the little garrons the rangers rode . I had hoped we might stay the night in the village, he said wistfully . It would be nice to sleep under a roof again.Jon Snow sat up suddenly, and the three men froze at the sound of the slosh . [BOS] My lords, [EOS] he said with cold courtesy.Jon commanded, and Kegs blew two long blasts, to wake Grenn and the other sleepers who ’ d had the watch during the night . If the wildlings were coming, the Wall would need every man . Gods know, we have few enough . Jon looked at Pyp and Kegs and Satin, Horse and Owen the Oaf, Tim Tangletongue, Mully, Spare Boot, and the rest, and tried to imagine them going belly to belly and blade to blade against a hundred screaming wildlings in the freezing darkness of that tunnel, with only a few iron bars between them . That was what it would come down to, unless they could stop the turtle before the gate was breached . [BOS] Sound the warhorn, [EOS] The horn was huge, eight feet along the curve and so wide at the mouth that he could have put his arm inside up to the elbow . If this came from an aurochs, it was the biggest that ever lived . At first he thought the bands around it were bronze, but when he moved closer he realized they were gold . Old gold, more brown than yellow, and graven with runes.Ygritte . Her hand rubbed at her throat and came away bloody . She stared at the wetness.We ’ re not to talk to you, the girl remembered suddenly.Maester Aemon had counted more than a hundred name days, Jon knew . Frail, shrunken, wizened, and blind, it was hard to imagine him as a little boy no older than Arya.She ’ s dead.I ’ m no lord.Me? said Pyp.Jon? Samwell Tarly called up . I thought it looked like you . Are you well?There ’ s always a bear, declared Dolorous Edd in his usual tone of gloomy resignation . One killed my brother when I was young . Afterward it wore his teeth around its neck on a leather thong . And they were good teeth too, better than mine . I ’ ve had nothing but trouble with my teeth.Someone must—I ’ ll have his best . Smart birds, and strong.Sam told the tale in a calm, dead voice, as if it were something that had happened to someone else, not to him . And strangely, Jon thought, he did not weep, not even once . When he was done, they sat together and listened to the wind for a time . There was no other sound in all the world.Jon told him . [BOS] She was … very kind, [EOS] Some commands are more easily given than obeyed . They wrapped the dead men in cloaks, but when Hake and Dywen tried to tie one onto a horse, the animal went mad, screaming and rearing, lashing out with its hooves, even biting at Ketter when he ran to help . The rangers had no better luck with the other garrons; not even the most placid wanted any part of these burdens . In the end they were forced to hack off branches and fashion crude slings to carry the corpses back on foot . It was well past midday by the time they started back.Whoever? Stannis gave him a measuring look . Does this mean you will not wed the girl? I warn you, she is part of the price you must pay, if you want your father ’ s name and your father ’ s castle . This match is necessary, to help assure the loyalty of our new subjects . Are you refusing me, Jon Snow?Every night when they made camp, Ygritte threw her sleeping skins down beside his own, no matter if he was near the fire or well away from it . Once he woke to find her nestled against him, her arm across his chest . He lay listening to her breathe for a long time, trying to ignore the tension in his groin . Rangers often shared skins for warmth, but warmth was not all Ygritte wanted, he suspected . After that he had taken to using Ghost to keep her away . Old Nan used to tell stories about knights and their ladies who would sleep in a single bed with a blade between them for honor ’ s sake, but he thought this must be the first time where a direwolf took the place of the sword.Ygritte pushed herself onto an elbow . I am nineteen, and a spearwife, and kissed by fire . How could I be maiden?Would that we had another hand to send to Renly.The wine was steaming . Jon lifted the kettle off the fire, filled eight cups, and carried them into the tent . The Old Bear was peering at the crude map Sam had drawn him that night back in Craster ’ s Keep . He took a cup from Jon ’ s tray, tried a swallow of wine, and gave a brusque nod of approval . His raven hopped down his arm . Corn, it said . Corn . Corn.That startled him . Why?Jon said fervently . [BOS] I have to, [EOS] The last twenty feet of the tunnel was where they ’ d fought and died . The outer door of studded oak had been hacked and broken and finally torn off its hinges, and one of the giants had crawled in through the splinters . The lantern bathed the grisly scene in a sullen reddish light . Pyp turned aside to retch, and Jon found himself envying Maester Aemon his blindness.Good . The night will be cold, I ’ ll want hot spice wine . Find me a flagon of red, not too sour, and don ’ t skimp on the spices . And tell Hobb that if he sends me boiled mutton again I ’ m like to boil him . That last haunch was grey . Even the bird wouldn ’ t touch it . He stroked the raven ’ s head with his thumb, and the bird made a contented quorking sound . Away with you . I ’ ve work to do.The steep stone steps had Sam puffing like a blacksmith ’ s bellows by the time they reached the surface . They emerged into a brisk wind that made Jon ’ s cloak swirl and snap . Ghost was stretched out asleep beneath the wattle-and-daub wall of the granary, but he woke when Jon appeared, bushy white tail held stiffly upright as he trotted to them.I . . . I know that . What could he say?That grim thought soured Jon ’ s fragile mood . I need to see Hobb about the Old Bear ’ s supper, he announced brusquely, sliding Longclaw back into its scabbard . His friends meant well, but they did not understand . It was not their fault, truly; they had not had to face Othor, they had not seen the pale glow of those dead blue eyes, had not felt the cold of those dead black fingers . Nor did they know of the fighting in the riverlands . How could they hope to comprehend? He turned away from them abruptly and strode off, sullen . Pyp called after him, but Jon paid him no mind.Jon said . [BOS] At what? [EOS] A fire was burning in the hearth, and the room was almost stuffy . The warmth made Jon sleepy . As soon as Noye eased him down onto his back, he closed his eyes to stop the world from spinning . He could hear the ravens quorking and complaining in the rookery above . Snow, one bird was saying . Snow, snow, snow . That was Sam ’ s doing, Jon remembered . Had Samwell Tarly made it home safely, he wondered, or only the birds?And what metal is Robb? Jon did not ask . Noye was a Baratheon man; likely he thought Joffrey the lawful king and Robb a traitor . Among the brotherhood of the Night ’ s Watch, there was an unspoken pact never to probe too deeply into such matters . Men came to the Wall from all of the Seven Kingdoms, and old loves and loyalties were not easily forgotten, no matter how many oaths a man swore . . . as Jon himself had good reason to know . Even Sam—his father ’ s House was sworn to Highgarden, whose Lord Tyrell supported King Renly . Best not to talk of such things . The Night ’ s Watch took no sides . Jon said . [BOS] Lord Mormont awaits us, [EOS] Now it is our turn to pounce . He wished he could move as sure and silent as that shadowcat, and kill as quickly . Longclaw was sheathed across his back, but he might not have room to use it . He carried dirk and dagger for closer work . They will have weapons as well, and I am not armored . He wondered who would prove the shadowcat by night ’ s end, and who the ram.It was soon revealed that the new recruit had brought his own armor with him; padded doublet, boiled leather, mail and plate and helm, even a great wood-and-leather shield blazoned with the same striding huntsman he wore on his surcoat . As none of it was black, however, Ser Alliser insisted that he reequip himself from the armory . That took half the morning . His girth required Donal Noye to take apart a mail hauberk and refit it with leather panels at the sides . To get a helm over his head the armorer had to detach the visor . His leathers bound so tightly around his legs and under his arms that he could scarcely move . Dressed for battle, the new boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst its skin . Let us hope you are not as inept as you look, Ser Alliser said . Halder, see what Ser Piggy can do.By the time his team had recovered from that mischance, Grigg the Goat had almost drawn even with them . Errok ’ s four remained well behind . The face where they were climbing looked smooth and unpitted, covered with a sheet of icemelt that glistened wetly where the sun brushed it . Grigg ’ s section was darker to the eye, with more obvious features; long horizontal ledges where a block had been imperfectly positioned atop the block below, cracks and crevices, even chimneys along the vertical joins, where wind and water had eaten holes large enough for a man to hide in.I ’ ve never had a crown on my head or sat my arse on a bloody throne, if that ’ s what you ’ re asking, Mance replied . My birth is as low as a man ’ s can get, no septon ’ s ever smeared my head with oils, I don ’ t own any castles, and my queen wears furs and amber, not silk and sapphires . I am my own champion, my own fool, and my own harpist . You don ’ t become King-beyond-the-Wall because your father was . The free folk won ’ t follow a name, and they don ’ t care which brother was born first . They follow fighters . When I left the Shadow Tower there were five men making noises about how they might be the stuff of kings . Tormund was one, the Magnar another . The other three I slew, when they made it plain they ’ d sooner fight than follow.Closer at hand, it was the trees that ruled . To south and east the wood went on as far as Jon could see, a vast tangle of root and limb painted in a thousand shades of green, with here and there a patch of red where a weirwood shouldered through the pines and sentinels, or a blush of yellow where some broadleafs had begun to turn . When the wind blew, he could hear the creak and groan of branches older than he was . A thousand leaves fluttered, and for a moment the forest seemed a deep green sea, storm-tossed and heaving, eternal and unknowable.Most days he gave as good as he got, Jon liked to think, but not today . He had hardly slept last night, and after an hour of restless tossing he had given up even the attempt, dressed, and walked the top of the Wall till the sun came up, wrestling with Stannis Baratheon ’ s offer . The lack of sleep was catching up with him now, and Emmett was hammering him mercilessly across the yard, driving him back on his heels with one long looping cut after another, and slamming him with his shield from time to time for good measure . Jon ’ s arm had gone numb from the shock of impact, and the edgeless practice sword seemed to be growing heavier with every passing moment.I did . I do . That ’ s closer to the mark, yes . But not a hit . Mance Rayder rose, unfastened the clasp that held his cloak, and swept it over the bench . It was for this.Jon wished he understood what they were talking about, and why . What did he care about ravens and doves? If the old man had something to say to him, why couldn ’ t he just say it?I think he means for you to have a crown, my lord.Qhorin Halfhand . The girl looked half a child beside him, but she faced him boldly.Sam opened his mouth, gave a little squeak . The Old Bear terrified him . Jon offered quickly . [BOS] No, my lord, You look strong as a . . . a . . . [EOS] The King-beyond-the-Wall looked nothing like a king, nor even much a wildling . He was of middling height, slender, sharp-faced, with shrewd brown eyes and long brown hair that had gone mostly to grey . There was no crown on his head, no gold rings on his arms, no jewels at his throat, not even a gleam of silver . He wore wool and leather, and his only garment of note was his ragged black wool cloak, its long tears patched with faded red silk.He fathered a bastard, a small voice whispered inside him . Where was the honor in that? And your mother, what of her? He will not even speak her name.We call them merlons . They were painted gold a long time ago . This is Queenscrown.Jon called . [BOS] Get another, [EOS] Jarman Buckwell . He returned a fortnight past . His scouts claim they saw you with their own eyes, riding along beside the wildling column and wearing a sheepskin cloak . Noye eyed him . I see the last part ’ s true.It was Ghost who knew what to do . Silent as shadow, the pale direwolf moved closer and began to lick the warm tears off Samwell Tarly ’ s face . The fat boy cried out, startled … and somehow, in a heartbeat, his sobs turned to laughter.Qhorin came up beside him . A frozen river, you say?Why didn ’ t you get up and fight? Grenn demanded.The Thenns were hardened warriors, and more disciplined than the common run of wildling; no doubt that was why Mance had chosen them . The defenders of Castle Black would include blind Maester Aemon and his half-blind steward Clydas, one-armed Donal Noye, drunken Septon Cellador, Deaf Dick Follard, Three-Finger Hobb the cook, old Ser Wynton Stout, as well as Halder and Toad and Pyp and Albett and the rest of the boys who ’ d trained with Jon . And commanding them would be red-faced Bowen Marsh, the plump Lord Steward who had been made castellan in Lord Mormont ’ s absence . Dolorous Edd sometimes called Marsh the Old Pomegranate, which fit him just as well as the Old Bear fit Mormont . He ’ s the man you want in front when the foes are in the field, Edd would say in his usual dour voice . He ’ ll count them right up for you . A regular demon for counting, that one.This man wears a hunting horn . Mormont pointed at Othor . Must I suppose that he died without sounding it? Or have your rangers all gone deaf as well as blind?His eyes stung . Jon rubbed at them savagely, cursing the smoke . He swallowed another gulp of wine and watched his direwolf devour the chicken.Crippled, Mormont said . I ’ m sorry, boy . Read the rest of the letter.Your brothers were avenged, Grenn said . Bolton ’ s son killed all the ironmen, and it ’ s said he ’ s flaying Theon Greyjoy inch by inch for what he did.Jon nodded . [BOS] Does it have a name, my lord? [EOS] Jon said . [BOS] My friends brought me back, [EOS] Nor live, I hope, Mormont said, cutting his ham with a dagger and feeding a bite to the bird . You have not deserted—yet . Here you stand . If we beheaded every boy who rode to Mole ’ s Town in the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall . Yet maybe you mean to flee again on the morrow, or a fortnight from now . Is that it? Is that your hope, boy?Jon said . He wanted to ride with Benjen Stark on his rangings, deep into the mysteries of the haunted forest, wanted to fight Mance Rayder ’ s wildlings and ward the realm against the Others, but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted . [BOS] It ’ s nothing special, The rangers say it ’ s just woods and mountains and frozen lakes, with lots of snow and ice . [EOS] Ben Stark laughed . As I feared . Ah, well . I believe I was younger than you the first time I got truly and sincerely drunk . He snagged a roasted onion, dripping brown with gravy, from a nearby trencher and bit into it . It crunched.As they passed the sept, he heard voices raised in song . Some men want whores on the eve of battle, and some want gods . Jon wondered who felt better afterward . The sept tempted him no more than the brothel; his own gods kept their temples in the wild places, where the weirwoods spread their bone-white branches . The Seven have no power beyond the Wall, he thought, but my gods will be waiting.Slow as honey on a cold morning, the rangers swept down on the wildling camp, picking their way through clumps of gorse and stands of trees, over roots and rocks . Wildlings flew to meet them, shouting war cries and waving clubs and bronze swords and axes made of flint, galloping headlong at their ancient enemies . A shout, a slash, and a fine brave death, Jon had heard brothers say of the free folk ’ s way of fighting.I left the next morning . . . for a place where a kiss was not a crime, and a man could wear any cloak he chose . He closed the clasp and sat back down again . And you, Jon Snow?Jon carried the word back to Ser Ottyn Wythers, plodding along with the rear guard . A small prune-faced man of an age with Mormont, Ser Ottyn always looked tired, even at Castle Black, and the rain had beaten him down unmercifully . Welcome tidings, he said . This wet has soaked my bones, and even my saddle sores complain of saddle sores.Jon tried to rise . [BOS] I don ’ t need— [EOS] Jon could hear the sounds of their feeding echoing off the rocks . It gave him an uneasy feeling . The warmth of the fire made him realize how bone-tired he was, but he dared not sleep . He had taken a captive, and it was on him to guard her . Were they your kin? he asked her quietly . The two we killed?But the gate was a crooked tunnel through the ice, smaller than any castle gate in the Seven Kingdoms, so narrow that rangers must lead their garrons through single file . Three iron grates closed the inner passage, each locked and chained and protected by a murder hole . The outer door was old oak, nine inches thick and studded with iron, not easy to break through . But Mance has mammoths, he reminded himself, and giants as well.As morning turned to afternoon, the smoke of Mole ’ s Town blew away and the southern sky was clear again . No clouds, thought Jon . That was good . Rain or snow could doom them all.They said the words together, as the last light faded in the west and grey day became black night.His fingers were growing stiff and his thumb was bleeding, but still Jon notched and drew and loosed . A gout of flame caught his eye, and he turned to see the door of the common hall afire . It was only a few moments before the whole great timbered hall was burning . Three-Finger Hobb and his Mole ’ s Town helpers were safe atop the Wall, he knew, but it felt like a punch in the belly all the same . JON, Deaf Dick yelled in his thick voice, the armory . They were on the roof, he saw . One had a torch . Dick hopped up on the crenel for a better shot, jerked his crossbow to his shoulder, and sent a quarrel thrumming toward the torch man . He missed.These are a free folk indeed, Jon saw . Rattleshirt might lead them, but none of them were shy in talking back to him.Belike we shall all die, then . Our dying will buy time for our brothers on the Wall . Time to garrison the empty castles and freeze shut the gates, time to summon lords and kings to their aid, time to hone their axes and repair their catapults . Our lives will be coin well spent.Jon said . [BOS] It never happened, [EOS] Noye pointed north . Loose enough arrows, might be you ’ ll find a few . At least you ’ ll make them fretful . He looked around the ring of firelit faces . I need two bows and two spears to help me hold the tunnel if they break the gate . More than ten stepped forward, and the smith picked his four . Jon, you have the Wall till I return.The Great Hall of Winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted meat and fresh-baked bread . Its grey stone walls were draped with banners . White, gold, crimson: the direwolf of Stark, Baratheon ’ s crowned stag, the lion of Lannister . A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad, but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the clangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations.Bastard children were born from lust and lies, men said; their nature was wanton and treacherous . Once Jon had meant to prove them wrong, to show his lord father that he could be as good and true a son as Robb . I made a botch of that . Robb had become a hero king; if Jon was remembered at all, it would be as a turncloak, an oathbreaker, and a murderer . He was glad that Lord Eddard was not alive to see his shame.Grenn cradled his hand . The bastard broke my wrist.I expect you will want to say your words before a heart tree, as your uncle did, Mormont said.Jon said, too late . She bolted, ran . [BOS] Wait, [EOS] Sam ’ s chins quivered . You could care for the ravens, or Grenn could, or anyone, he said with a thin edge of desperation in his voice . I could show you how . You know your letters too, you could write down Lord Mormont ’ s messages as well as I.We should have built hoardings . Jon thought he could hear the crash of axes on wood, but that was probably just fear ringing in his ears . He looked to Grenn . Do it.How did he come here? Sam asked.Jon said . [BOS] Yes, my lord, I rode with the wildlings and ate with them, as the Halfhand commanded me, and I shared my furs with Ygritte . But I swear to you, I never turned my cloak . I escaped the Magnar as soon as I could, and never took up arms against my brothers or the realm . [EOS] A toothless smile quivered on the ancient lips . Only a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night ’ s Watch . In my order, we put aside our house names when we take our vows and don the collar . The old man touched the maester ’ s chain that hung loosely around his thin, fleshless neck . My father was Maekar, the First of his Name, and my brother Aegon reigned after him in my stead . My grandfather named me for Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, who was his uncle, or his father, depending on which tale you believe . Aemon, he called me …Maester Aemon smiled . And so?A stab of pain reminded him of his own woes . The maester squeezed his hand . Clydas is bringing milk of the poppy.And then he heard the laughter, sharp and cruel as a whip, and the voice of Ser Alliser Thorne . Not only a bastard, but a traitor ’ s bastard, he was telling the men around him.Jon said, truthfully . [BOS] The villages were deserted, It was as if all the free folk had vanished . [EOS] Very good! Yes, that was the first time . You were just a boy, and I was all in black, one of a dozen riding escort to old Lord Commander Qorgyle when he came down to see your father at Winterfell . I was walking the wall around the yard when I came on you and your brother Robb . It had snowed the night before, and the two of you had built a great mountain above the gate and were waiting for someone likely to pass underneath.Let me, a voice said . Thick-fingered hands unfastened helm from gorget and lifted it off gently . Did he hurt you?Stonesnake took the lead . He was a short wiry man, near fifty and grey of beard but stronger than he seemed, and he had the best night eyes of anyone Jon had ever known . He needed them tonight . By day the mountains were blue-grey, brushed with frost, but once the sun vanished behind the jagged peaks they turned black . Now the rising moon had limned them in white and silver.By the sixth hour, Jarl had moved ahead of Grigg the Goat again, and his men were widening the gap . The Mance ’ s pet must want a sword, the Magnar said, shading his eyes . The sun was high in the sky, and the upper third of the Wall was a crystalline blue from below, reflecting so brilliantly that it hurt the eyes to look on it . Jarl ’ s four and Grigg ’ s were all but lost in the glare, though Errok ’ s team was still in shadow . Instead of moving upward they were edging their way sideways at about five hundred feet, making for a chimney . Jon was watching them inch along when he heard the sound—a sudden crack that seemed to roll along the ice, followed by a shout of alarm . And then the air was full of shards and shrieks and falling men, as a sheet of ice a foot thick and fifty feet square broke off from the Wall and came tumbling, crumbling, rumbling, sweeping all before it . Even down at the foot of the ridge, some chunks came spinning through the trees and rolling down the slope . Jon grabbed Ygritte and pulled her down to shield her, and one of the Thenns was struck in the face by a chunk that broke his nose.Nothing was what he had expected; Whitetree was the fourth village they had passed, and it had been the same in all of them . The people were gone, vanished with their scant possessions and whatever animals they may have had . None of the villages showed any signs of having been attacked . They were simply . . . empty . Jon asked . [BOS] What do you think happened to them all? [EOS] Do you mislike the girl? Tormund asked him as they passed another twenty mammoths, these bearing wildlings in tall wooden towers instead of giants.Blood matted the fat boy ’ s hair where Halder had split his helm asunder . My name is Samwell Tarly, of Horn … He stopped and licked his lips . I mean, I was of Horn Hill, until I … left . I ’ ve come to take the black . My father is Lord Randyll, a bannerman to the Tyrells of Highgarden . I used to be his heir, only … His voice trailed off.What gods? Jon was remembering that they ’ d seen no boys in Craster ’ s Keep, nor men either, save Craster himself.You bloody crows . Tormund ’ s tone was gruff, yet strangely gentle . That Longspear stole me daughter . Munda, me little autumn apple . Took her right out o ’ my tent with all four o ’ her brothers about . Toregg slept through it, the great lout, and Torwynd . . . well, Torwynd the Tame, that says all that needs saying, don ’ t it? The young ones gave the lad a fight, though.Then suddenly the mammoths were fleeing, running from the smoke and flames and smashing into those behind them in their terror . Those went backward too, the giants and wildlings behind them scrambling to get out of their way . In half a heartbeat the whole center was collapsing . The horsemen on the flanks saw themselves being abandoned and decided to fall back as well, not one so much as blooded . Even the chariots rumbled off, having done nothing but look fearsome and make a lot of noise . When they break, they break hard, Jon Snow thought as he watched them reel away . The drums had all gone silent . How do you like that music, Mance? How do you like the taste of the Dornishman ’ s wife? Do we have anyone hurt? he asked.Thoren Smallwood dismounted beside the trunk, dark in his plate and mail . Look at that face . Small wonder men feared them, when they first came to Westeros . I ’ d like to take an axe to the bloody thing myself.The bastard hamstrung you, opened your empty skull, and cut off your hand . Or would have, if these blades had an edge . It ’ s fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers . Ser Alliser gestured at Jeren and Toad . Get the Aurochs on his feet, he has funeral arrangements to make.Cotter Pyke stood up . You won ’ t suffer it? Might be you had those gold cloaks trained to lick your bloody arse, but you ’ re wearing a black cloak now.The Old Bear commanded, said Jon . This place was high and strong, and he made it stronger . He dug pits and planted stakes, laid up food and water . He was ready for . . .Then I haven ’ t seen you, Robb replied . Jon left him standing there in the snow, surrounded by wagons and wolves and horses . It was a short walk to the armory . He picked up his package and took the covered bridge across to the Keep.He had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him . Robb would someday inherit Winterfell, would command great armies as the Warden of the North . Bran and Rickon would be Robb ’ s bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name . His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own . But what place could a bastard hope to earn?I ’ m fat, not blind, Samwell Tarly said . Of course I saw it, it ’ s seven hundred feet high . Yet he stood up all the same, wrapped a fur-lined cloak over his shoulders, and followed Jon from the common hall, still wary, as if he suspected some cruel trick was waiting for him in the night . Ghost padded along beside them . I never thought it would be like this, Sam said as they walked, his words steaming in the cold air . Already he was huffing and puffing as he tried to keep up . All the buildings are falling down, and it ’ s so … so …The scream brought Val out of the tent, white-faced . What is it, what ’ s happened? Varamyr ’ s wolves were fighting each other, and the shadowcat had raced off into the trees, but the man was still twisting on the ground . What ’ s wrong with him? Val demanded, horrified . Where ’ s Mance?Outside, one of the guards looked at him and said, Be strong, boy . The gods are cruel.Only now those foes have gotten past the Wall to come up from the south, Jon reflected, and the lords and kings of the Seven Kingdoms have forgotten us . We are caught between the hammer and the anvil . Without a wall Castle Black could not be held; Donal Noye knew that as well as any . The castle does them no good, the armorer told his little garrison . Kitchens, common hall, stables, even the towers . . . let them take it all . We ’ ll empty the armory and move what stores we can to the top of the Wall, and make our stand around the gate.Halder lowered his sword . He yielded, he echoed.Here, said Satin.Take me for what?Then the skinchanger threw back his head and screamed.Mormont stroked the bird ’ s black feathers, and stifled a sudden yawn with the back of his hand . I will forsake supper, I believe . Rest will serve me better . Wake me at first light.Queer? Pyp was all curiosity . How queer?You admit to being an oathbreaker, then, said Janos Slynt.I would not, Grenn insisted . I ’ d run away faster than you . He stopped suddenly, scowling when he saw Pyp ’ s grin and realized what he ’ d just said . His thick neck flushed a dark red . Jon left them there arguing as he returned to the armory, hung up his sword, and stripped off his battered armor.Pyp let fly a whoop and thrust his sword into the air . Ser Alliser fixed him with a reptile stare . They will call you men of Night ’ s Watch now, but you are bigger fools than the Mummer ’ s Monkey here if you believe that . You are boys still, green and stinking of summer, and when the winter comes you will die like flies . And with that, Ser Alliser Thorne took his leave of them.If Marsh is gone, who did he name as castellan?You are so, insisted Grenn . You ’ re dumber.Squire Dalbridge smiled . It ’ s always pretty women in my dreams . Would that I dreamed more often.Donal Noye did not return, nor any of them who ’ d gone down with him to hold that black cold tunnel . The Wall is mine, Jon reminded himself whenever he felt his strength flagging . He had taken up a longbow himself, and his fingers felt crabbed and stiff, half-frozen . His fever was back as well, and his leg would tremble uncontrollably, sending a white-hot knife of pain right through him . One more arrow, and I ’ ll rest, he told himself, half a hundred times . Just one more . Whenever his quiver was empty, one of the orphaned moles would bring him another . One more quiver, and I ’ m done . It couldn ’ t be long until the dawn.Jon looked . The armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match . His nose was flat and broad, and he always seemed in need of a shave . The left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword . [BOS] Words won ’ t make your mother a whore . She was what she was, and nothing Toad says can change that . You know, we have men on the Wall whose mothers were whores . [EOS] Something? Mormont ’ s raven lifted its head and screamed . The sound was sharp as a knife in the closeness of the tent.The dogs liked it least of all . Ghost had led the party here; the pack of hounds had been useless . When Bass the kennelmaster had tried to get them to take the scent from the severed hand, they had gone wild, yowling and barking, fighting to get away . Even now they were snarling and whimpering by turns, pulling at their leashes while Chett cursed them for curs.The call came drifting through the black of night . Jon pushed himself onto an elbow, his hand reaching for Longclaw by force of habit as the camp began to stir . The horn that wakes the sleepers, he thought.. . . me? finished Mance Rayder . Aye, he was . Had I been fool enough to storm this hill, I might have lost five men for every crow I slew and still counted myself lucky . His mouth grew hard . But when the dead walk, walls and stakes and swords mean nothing . You cannot fight the dead, Jon Snow . No man knows that half so well as me . He gazed up at the darkening sky and said, The crows may have helped us more than they know . I ’ d wondered why we ’ d suffered no attacks . But there ’ s still a hundred leagues to go, and the cold is rising . Varamyr, send your wolves sniffing after the wights, I won ’ t have them taking us unawares . My Lord of Bones, double all the patrols, and make certain every man has torch and flint . Styr, Jarl, you ride at first light.Jon drew Longsclaw . [BOS] Get away from us, unless you want what Qhorin got . [EOS] Jon said stubbornly . [BOS] It ’ s better that I ’ m by myself, The rest of them are scared of Ghost . [EOS] Jon reminded him sharply . Tyrion Lannister had been a friend to him . If Lord Eddard was killed, she would be as much to blame as the queen . [BOS] Lady Stark is not my mother, My lord, what of my sisters? Arya and Sansa, they were with my father, do you know— [EOS] It is . Jon took her hand.He had made a dagger for Grenn as well, and another for the Lord Commander . The warhorn he had given to Sam . On closer examination the horn had proved cracked, and even after he had cleaned all the dirt out, Jon had been unable to get any sound from it . The rim was chipped as well, but Sam liked old things, even worthless old things . Jon told him, [BOS] Make a drinking horn out of it, and every time you take a drink you ’ ll remember how you ranged beyond the Wall, all the way to the Fist of the First Men . [EOS] He gave Sam a spearhead and a dozen arrowheads as well, and passed the rest out among his other friends for luck.I don ’ t even know your name.I never knew there would be so many, Satin said.Three days after their arrival, Jon had heard that Benjen Stark was to lead a half-dozen men on a ranging into the haunted forest . That night he sought out his uncle in the great timbered common hall and pleaded to go with him . Benjen refused him curtly . This is not Winterfell, he told him as he cut his meat with fork and dagger . On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns . You ’ re no ranger, Jon, only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you.No one moved.Wise boys, Lannister said . Then he changed the subject . The talk is, your uncle is too long away.Showing you how old I am . She unlaced her doeskin shirt, tossed it aside, pulled her three woolen undershirts up over her head all at once . I want you should see me.Me . The ranger they called Stonesnake had already shown that he was the best climber among them . It would have to be him.Aye? Tormund gave a sad shake of the head . A waste . If I ’ d been ten years younger, I ’ d have stolen her meself . That hair she had . Well, the hottest fires burn out quickest . He lifted the skin of mead . To Ygritte, kissed by fire! He drank deep.Whose laws? The laws of Winterfell and King ’ s Landing? Mance laughed . When we want laws we ’ ll make our own . You can keep your king ’ s justice too, and your king ’ s taxes . I ’ m offering you the horn, not our freedom . We will not kneel to you.Bowen Marsh was waiting at the first gate as they led their garrons through the icy tunnel . The Lord Steward was red-faced and agitated . My lord, he blurted at Mormont as he swung open the iron bars, there ’ s been a bird, you must come at once.You drank the wine?Jon stood up . [BOS] I ’ ll break the other one for you if you ask nicely . [EOS] Grenn was sixteen and a head taller than Jon . All four of them were bigger than he was, but they did not scare him . He ’ d beaten every one of them in the yard.Can a bird hate? Jon had slain the wilding Orell, but some part of the man remained within the eagle . The golden eyes looked out on him with cold malevolence . I ’ ll come, he said . The blood kept running down into his right eye, and his cheek was a blaze of pain . When he touched it his black gloves came away stained with red . Let me catch my garron . It was not the horse he wanted so much as Ghost, but the direwolf was nowhere to be seen . He could be leagues away by now, ripping out the throat of some elk . Perhaps that was just as well.Know, the raven echoed from Mormont ’ s shoulder . Know.Lord Brandon had no other children . At his behest, the black crows flew forth from their castles in the hundreds, but nowhere could they find any sign o ’ Bael or this maid . For most a year they searched, till the lord lost heart and took to his bed, and it seemed as though the line o ’ Starks was at its end . But one night as he lay waiting to die, Lord Brandon heard a child ’ s cry . He followed the sound and found his daughter back in her bedchamber, asleep with a babe at her breast.Sam edged past Jon and the garrons, sweating profusely . My lord, it … it can ’ t be a day or … look … the blood …Do you have names for them as well? Jon asked, as he went to one knee beside the direwolf and scratched the thick white fur on his neck . The Hare? The Doe? The She-Wolf? Ghost licked his face, his rough wet tongue rasping against the scabs where the eagle ’ s talons had ripped Jon ’ s cheek . The bird marked both of us, he thought . Ghost, he said quietly, on the morrow we go over . There ’ s no steps here, no cage-and-crane, no way for me to get you to the other side . We have to part . Do you understand?Jon rose at dawn the next day to watch his uncle leave . One of his rangers, a big ugly man, sang a bawdy song as he saddled his garron, his breath steaming in the cold morning air . Ben Stark smiled at that, but he had no smile for his nephew . [BOS] How often must I tell you no, Jon? We ’ ll speak when I return . [EOS] Beneath the dragonglass was an old warhorn, made from an auroch ’ s horn and banded in bronze . Jon shook the dirt from inside it, and a stream of arrowheads fell out . He let them fall, and pulled up a corner of the cloth the weapons had been wrapped in, rubbing it between his fingers . Good wool, thick, a double weave, damp but not rotted . It could not have been long in the ground . And it was dark . He seized a handful and pulled it close to the torch . Not dark . Black.The arrow made a soft hiss as it left his string . A moment later there was a grunt, and suddenly only two shadows were loping across the yard . They ran all the faster, but Jon had already pulled a second arrow from his quiver . This time he hurried the shot too much, and missed . The wildlings were gone by the time he nocked again . He searched for another target, and found four, rushing around the empty shell of the Lord Commander ’ s Keep . The moonlight glimmered off their spears and axes, and the gruesome devices on their round leathern shields; skulls and bones, serpents, bear claws, twisted demonic faces . Free folk, he knew . The Thenns carried shields of black boiled leather with bronze rims and bosses, but theirs were plain and unadorned . These were the lighter wicker shields of raiders.Jon had never heard this tale before . [BOS] Which Brandon was this supposed to be? Brandon the Builder lived in the Age of Heroes, thousands of years before Bael . There was Brandon the Burner and his father Brandon the Shipwright, but— [EOS] He ’ d have t ’ be quick and cunning and brave t ’ steal me . So his sons would be strong and smart as well . Why would I hate such a man as that?On his way back, Jon swung wide of the column ’ s line of march and took a shorter path through the thick of the wood . The sounds of man and horse diminished, swallowed up by the wet green wild, and soon enough he could hear only the steady wash of rain against leaf and tree and rock . It was midafternoon, yet the forest seemed as dark as dusk . Jon wove a path between rocks and puddles, past great oaks, grey-green sentinels, and black-barked ironwoods . In places the branches wove a canopy overhead and he was given a moment ’ s respite from the drumming of the rain against his head . As he rode past a lightning-blasted chestnut tree overgrown with wild white roses, he heard something rustling in the underbrush . Ghost, he called out . Ghost, to me.Jon flexed his fingers, opening and closing his fist the way the maester had shown him . [BOS] Well enough . I ’ m to work the fingers every day to keep them nimble, as Maester Aemon said . [EOS] But others had come crowding round, drawn by the woman ’ s scream and the crash of the rabbit hutch . Don ’ t you believe him, girl, called out Lark the Sisterman, a ranger mean as a cur . That ’ s Lord Snow himself.And then Qhorin ’ s sword was coming at him and somehow Longclaw leapt upward to block . The force of impact almost knocked the bastard blade from Jon ’ s hand, and sent him staggering backward . You must not balk, whatever is asked of you . He shifted to a two-hand grip, quick enough to deliver a stroke of his own, but the big ranger brushed it aside with contemptuous ease . Back and forth they went, black cloaks swirling, the youth ’ s quickness against the savage strength of Qhorin ’ s left-hand cuts . The Halfhand ’ s longsword seemed to be everywhere at once, raining down from one side and then the other, driving him where he would, keeping him off balance . Already he could feel his arms growing numb.His face was throbbing . Tormund stood over them bellowing, he saw from his right eye as he rubbed blood from his left . Then there were hoofbeats, shouts, and the clacking of old dry bones.Ser Jaremy looked startled . Neither did Flowers, he blurted, turning to stare at the dead man.No, Ygritte said, but a bard ’ s truth is different than yours or mine . Anyway, you asked for the story, so I told it . She turned away from him, closed her eyes, and seemed to sleep.To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night ’ s Watch.Errok and Del had crept ahead to scout the ruins, but Del was back almost at once . Styr halted the column and sent a dozen of his Thenns trotting forward, spears in hand . By then Jon had seen it too: the glimmer of a fire, reddening the chimney of the inn . We are not alone . Dread coiled inside him like a snake . He heard a horse neigh, and then shouts . Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them, Qhorin had said.I think it must be true . Else why refuse Ygritte? She ’ d hardly give you any fight at all, seems to me . The girl wants you in her, that ’ s plain enough to see.Jon jammed it open with his boot . [BOS] I need to speak to him now . The morning will be too late . [EOS] I am not your lord, said Mance . And the what is plain enough . Your brothers died . The question is, how many?I would . Sam carefully replaced the scroll in the bin from which Jon had plucked it . You can learn so much from ledgers like that, truly you can . It can tell you how many men were in the Night ’ s Watch then, how they lived, what they ate . . .The black brothers moved through black shadows amidst black rocks, working their way up a steep, twisting trail as their breath frosted in the black air . Jon felt almost naked without his mail, but he did not miss its weight . This was hard going, and slow . To hurry here was to risk a broken ankle or worse . Stonesnake seemed to know where to put his feet as if by instinct, but Jon needed to be more careful on the broken, uneven ground.Tormund rose to his feet . Hold . You gave Styr his style, give me mine.Stunned, Jon stood speechless for a moment, before he recovered enough to say, How . . . how could you know . . .Maester Aemon sniffed Jon ’ s wound again . Then he put the bloody cloth back in the basin and said, Donal, the hot knife, if you please . I shall need you to hold him still.My father . . . He hesitated.Grenn went off muttering, and Jon returned to the far eye, searching the wildling camp . From time to time an arrow would sail past overhead, but he had learned to ignore those . The range was long and the angle was bad, the chances of being hit were small . He still saw no sign of Mance Rayder in the camp, but he spied Tormund Giantsbane and two of his sons around the turtle . The sons were struggling with the mammoth hide while Tormund gnawed on the roast leg of a goat and bellowed orders . Elsewhere he found the wildling skinchanger, Varamyr Sixskins, walking through the trees with his shadowcat dogging his heels.Us? Mance said sharply.Lark got to one knee . He ’ s afraid of you, Chett . On the Sisters, we have a name for them like him.He found Ghost atop the hill, as he thought he might . The white wolf never howled, yet something drew him to the heights all the same, and he would squat there on his hindquarters, hot breath rising in a white mist as his red eyes drank the stars.Leave him where he is, Chett said . The Wall is no place for the weak . Let him train until he is ready, no matter how many years that takes . Ser Alliser shall make a man of him or kill him, as the gods will.I don ’ t think so . No one had ever told Jon just what lords did with their ladies . I only . . . wanted to kiss you there, that ’ s all . You seemed to like it.Jon slipped sideways between two sharpened stakes while Ghost slid beneath them . A torch had been thrust down into a crevice, its flames flying pale orange banners when the gusts came . He snatched it up as he squeezed through the gap between the stones . Ghost went racing down the hill . Jon followed more slowly, the torch thrust out before him as he made his descent . The camp sounds faded behind him . The night was black, the slope steep, stony, and uneven . A moment ’ s inattention would be a sure way to break an ankle . . . or his neck . What am I doing? he asked himself as he picked his way down.This … this is all wrong, Sam Tarly said earnestly . The blood … there ’ s bloodstains on their clothes, and … and their flesh, dry and hard, but … there ’ s none on the ground, or … anywhere . With those … those … those … Sam made himself swallow, took a deep breath . With those wounds … terrible wounds … there should be blood all over . Shouldn ’ t there?Where ’ s your wolf? Noye asked as they crossed the yard.Maester Aemon shuffled to the bedside, one hand on Grenn ’ s shoulder . Jon, be gentle with yourself . It is good that you have woken, but you must give yourself time to heal . We drowned the wound with boiling wine, and closed you up with a poultice of nettle, mustard seed and moldy bread, but unless you rest . . .Now . Tell me why you spared her.Take it, echoed his raven, preening . Take it, take it.The first time he had seen Castle Black with his own eyes, Jon had wondered why anyone would be so foolish as to build a castle without walls . How could it be defended?Ride? It was dark beyond the fire, and the night was cold . Ride where?Jon ’ s throat was raw . He looked at them all helplessly . [BOS] She yielded herself to me . [EOS] For a long way they stayed to the trail, following its twists and turns as it snaked along the side of the mountain, upward, ever upward . Sometimes the mountain folded back on itself and they lost sight of the fire, but soon or late it would always reappear . The path Stonesnake chose would never have served for the horses . In places Jon had to put his back to the cold stone and shuffle along sideways like a crab, inch by inch . Even where the track widened it was treacherous; there were cracks big enough to swallow a man ’ s leg, rubble to stumble over, hollow places where the water pooled by day and froze hard by night . One step and then another, Jon told himself . One step and then another, and I will not fall.Then hear me . If we are taken, you will go over to them, as the wildling girl you captured once urged you . They may demand that you cut your cloak to ribbons, that you swear them an oath on your father ’ s grave, that you curse your brothers and your Lord Commander . You must not balk, whatever is asked of you . Do as they bid you . . . but in your heart, remember who and what you are . Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them, for as long as it takes . And watch.Would that bones could talk, the Old Bear grumbled . This fellow could tell us much . How he died . Who burned him, and why . Where the wildlings have gone . He sighed . The children of the forest could speak to the dead, it ’ s said . But I can ’ t. He tossed the skull back into the mouth of the tree, where it landed with a puff of fine ash . Go through all these houses . Giant, get to the top of this tree, have a look . I ’ ll have the hounds brought up too . Perchance this time the trail will be fresher . His tone did not suggest that he held out much hope of the last.No . One patrol in four follows the base instead, to search for cracks in the foundation ice or signs of tunneling.Dick Follard was deaf as a stone, but his nose worked well enough . The buns were still warm from the oven when he went digging in the basket and plucked one out . He found a crock of butter as well, and spread some with his dagger . Raisins, he announced happily . Nuts, too . His speech was thick, but easy enough to understand once you got used to it.So there you have us, Jon Snow, said Mance Rayder . The King-beyond-the-Wall and his court, such as it is . And now some words from you, I think . Where did you come from?You should never have lied to me, Jon Snow, said Mance.Ghost padded beside their garrons as Jon and Ygritte descended the Fist . It was not until they were halfway across the Milkwater that Jon felt safe enough to say, I never asked you to lie for me.When all of them were in place, the Magnar shouted a brusque command in the Old Tongue, and five of his Thenns started up together . Even with the ladders, it was no easy climb . Ygritte watched them struggle for a while . I hate this Wall, she said in a low angry voice . Can you feel how cold it is?Grenn, go wake Maester Aemon, said Pyp . Tell him Jon needs more milk of the poppy.We ’ ll go back to the cave, he said . You ’ re not going to die, Ygritte . You ’ re not.I will, said Jon.The guards smiled at him from their niches as he wound his way down the turret stair, carrying the sword in his good hand . Sweet steel, one man said . You earned that, Snow, another told him . Jon made himself smile back at them, but his heart was not in it . He knew he should be pleased, yet he did not feel it . His hand ached, and the taste of anger was in his mouth, though he could not have said who he was angry with or why.When Qhorin Halfhand told him to find some brush for a fire, Jon knew their end was near.After that, every night seemed colder than the night before, and more lonely . Ghost was not always with them, but he was never far either . Even when they were apart, Jon sensed his nearness . He was glad for that . The Halfhand was not the most companionable of men . Qhorin ’ s long grey braid swung slowly with the motion of his horse . Often they would ride for hours without a word spoken, the only sounds the soft scrape of horseshoes on stone and the keening of the wind, which blew endlessly through the heights . When he slept, he did not dream; not of wolves, nor his brothers, nor anything . Even dreams cannot live up here, he told himself.Whatever demonic force moved Othor had been driven out by the flames; the twisted thing they had found in the ashes had been no more than cooked meat and charred bone . Yet in his nightmare he faced it again … and this time the burning corpse wore Lord Eddard ’ s features . It was his father ’ s skin that burst and blackened, his father ’ s eyes that ran liquid down his cheeks like jellied tears . Jon did not understand why that should be or what it might mean, but it frightened him more than he could say.I don ’ t know what your skull is stuffed with . My lord.He ’ s my father, Jon wanted to say, but he knew that Mormont would not want to hear it . His throat was dry . He made himself take another sip of wine.The girl watched him warily, but Stonesnake gave a mordant chuckle . It ’ s the captive supposed to tell things, remember? The ranger thrust a long branch into the fire . Not that she will . I ’ ve known wildlings to bite off their own tongues before they ’ d answer a question . When the end of the branch was blazing merrily, he took two steps and flung it out over the pass . It fell through the night spinning until it was lost to sight.Bro . . . our own men? Aemon ’ s words hurt a hundred times worse than his fingers . Jon remembered the Old Bear as last he ’ d seen him, standing before his tent with his raven on his arm croaking for corn . Mormont gone? He had feared it ever since he ’ d seen the aftermath of battle on the Fist, yet it was no less a blow . Who was it? Who turned on him?True or false, the Wall must be warned, the Old Bear said as Jon placed the platter between them . And the king.Boiled water will suffice . An egg and a bite of bacon.Blind he may be, but Aemon knows what he ’ s about . I pray the gods let us keep him another twenty years . Do you know that he might have been king?He settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank . The sweet, fruity taste of summerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips.A blowing rain lashed at Jon ’ s face as he spurred his horse across the swollen stream . Beside him, Lord Commander Mormont gave the hood of his cloak a tug, muttering curses on the weather . His raven sat on his shoulder, feathers ruffled, as soaked and grumpy as the Old Bear himself . A gust of wind sent wet leaves flapping round them like a flock of dead birds . The haunted forest, Jon thought ruefully . The drowned forest, more like it.The mantlets were slanting wooden shields, wide enough for five of the free folk to hide behind . The archers pushed them close, then knelt behind them to loose their arrows through slits in the wood . The first time the wildlings rolled them out, Jon had called for fire arrows and set a half-dozen ablaze, but after that Mance started covering them with raw hides . All the fire arrows in the world couldn ’ t make them catch now . The brothers had even started wagering as to which of the straw sentinels would collect the most arrows before they were done . Dolorous Edd was leading with four, but Othell Yarwyck, Tumberjon, and Watt of Long Lake had three apiece . It was Pyp who ’ d started naming the scarecrows after their missing brothers, too . It makes it seem as if there ’ s more of us, he said.Dywen sucked at his wooden teeth . Might be they didn ’ t die here . Might be someone brought ’ em and left ’ em for us . A warning, as like . The old forester peered down suspiciously . And might be I ’ m a fool, but I don ’ t know that Othor never had no blue eyes afore.Jon said, dismounting . [BOS] I ’ m not, [EOS] Jon said, remembering . [BOS] He told me that a maester ’ s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve, I asked why each link was a different metal . A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes, I said . Maester Luwin laughed . A maester forges his chain with study, he told me . The different metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for healing, iron for warcraft . And he said there were other meanings as well . The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves, isn ’ t that so? Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links can ’ t make a chain . You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like . A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people . [EOS] They ’ re dogs and he ’ s a wolf, said Jon . They know he ’ s not their kind . No more than I am yours . But he had his duty to be mindful of, the task Qhorin Halfhand had laid upon him as they shared that final fire—to play the part of turncloak, and find whatever it was that the wildlings had been seeking in the bleak cold wilderness of the Frostfangs . Some power, Qhorin had named it to the Old Bear, but he had died before learning what it was, or whether Mance Rayder had found it with his digging.Styr scowled . His heart may still be black.Jon hugged him back . [BOS] And you, Stark . Take care of Bran . [EOS] The crow is the raven ’ s poor cousin . They are both beggars in black, hated and misunderstood.The turtle crept slowly through stones and stumps and brush . The earlier attacks had cost the free folk a hundred lives or more . Most still lay where they had fallen . In the lulls the crows would come and pay them court, but now the birds fled screeching . They liked the look of that turtle no more than he did.The Magnar was not pleased . What do I want with a crow?They tell me that you slew one of these walking corpses to save Lord Mormont ’ s life, Stannis said . It may be that this is your war as well, Lord Snow . If you will give me your help.No, Donal Noye roared at three of the Mole ’ s Town men, down below . The pitch goes to the hoist, the oil up the steps, crossbow bolts to the fourth, fifth, and sixth landings, spears to first and second . Stack the lard under the stair, yes, there, behind the planks . The casks of meat are for the barricade . Now, you poxy plow pushers, NOW!Yes? Maester Aemon prompted.Gilly, he called me . For the gillyflower.Fire is life up here, said Qhorin Halfhand, but it can be death as well . By his command, they ’ d risked no open flames since entering the mountains . They ate cold salt beef, hard bread, and harder cheese, and slept clothed and huddled beneath a pile of cloaks and furs, grateful for each other ’ s warmth . It made Jon remember cold nights long ago at Winterfell, when he ’ d shared a bed with his brothers . These men were brothers too, though the bed they shared was stone and earth.The watcher on the walls, piped Toad.Aye, said Ygritte . Together with his brother Gendel, three thousand years ago . They led a host o ’ free folk through the caves, and the Watch was none the wiser . But when they come out, the wolves o ’ Winterfell fell upon them.Dywen clacked his teeth some more . Might be I do . Craster ’ s got ten fingers and one cock, so he don ’ t count but to eleven . He ’ d never miss a couple.You must not balk, whatever is asked of you, the Halfhand had said . Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them, for as long as it takes . He ’ d ridden many leagues and walked for more, had shared their bread and salt, and Ygritte ’ s blankets as well, but still they did not trust him . Day and night the Thenns watched him, alert for any signs of betrayal . He could not get away, and soon it would be too late.Jon had to hurry his steps to keep up with Qhorin ’ s long strides . [BOS] Lord Rickard died before I was born . [EOS] Black brothers are sworn never to take wives, don ’ t you know that? And we ’ re guests in your father ’ s hall besides.I would so, Grenn insisted . I ’ d see them a long way off.Yet still the drums beat on, the trebuchets shuddered and thumped, and the sound of skinpipes came wafting through the night like the songs of strange fierce birds . Septon Cellador began to sing as well, his voice tremulous and thick with wine.It ’ s done, isn ’ t it? asked Grenn.When the moon rose, Ebben parted from them . Stonesnake went east with him a short way, then doubled back to obscure their tracks, and the three who remained set off toward the southwest.Spinning, Jon saw the drapes he ’ d ripped from the window . He flung the lamp into the puddled cloth with both hands . Metal crunched, glass shattered, oil spewed, and the hangings went up in a great whoosh of flame . The heat of it on his face was sweeter than any kiss Jon had ever known . Ghost! he shouted.. . . was forswear his vows again.What are you doing here, bastard? Thorne asked.The king ’ s men were much in evidence in the yards of Castle Black . They stopped as Jon went by, and gaped at him . None of them had ever seen a direwolf before, he realized, and Ghost was twice as large as the common wolves that prowled their southron greenwoods . As he walked toward the armory, Jon chanced to look up and saw Val standing in her tower window . I ’ m sorry, he thought . I ’ m not the man to steal you out of there.I ’ ll bring him, my lord . The men from the Shadow Tower had been expected days ago . When they had not appeared, the brothers had begun to wonder . Jon had heard gloomy mutterings around the cookfire, and not just from Dolorous Edd . Ser Ottyn Wythers was for retreating to Castle Black as soon as possible . Ser Mallador Locke would strike for the Shadow Tower, hoping to pick up Qhorin ’ s trail and learn what had befallen him . And Thoren Smallwood wanted to push on into the mountains . Mance Rayder knows he must battle the Watch, Thoren had declared, but he will never look for us so far north . If we ride up the Milkwater, we can take him unawares and cut his host to ribbons before he knows we are on him.My brother . Jon had never learned which one, and hoped he never would.I saw him eat a pork pie, Toad said, smirking . Do you think it was a brother? He began to make oinking noises.Jon said . [BOS] Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys Mallister are no fools, sire, They ’ re good men, and capable . Othell Yarwyck as well, in his own way . Lord Mormont trusted each of them . [EOS] Jon Snow bowed stiffly and took his leave . Ser Ottyn Wythers was coming in as he was leaving, and they almost collided at the deerhide door . Outside, the rain seemed to have slackened . Tents had gone up all over the compound . Jon could see the tops of others under the trees.Your Grace? The king smiled . That ’ s not a style one often hears from the lips of free folk . I ’ m Mance to most, The Mance to some . Will you take a horn of mead?The men beneath the wood and hides would be pulling hard, Jon knew, putting their shoulders into it, straining to keep the wheels turning, but once the turtle was flush against the gate they would exchange their ropes for axes . At least Mance was not sending his mammoths today . Jon was glad of that . Their awesome strength was wasted on the Wall, and their size only made them easy targets . The last had been a day and a half in the dying, its mournful trumpetings terrible to hear.Samwell Tarly managed a sad little smile . I was never very safe in my father ’ s castle either.He ’ s never seen Harrenhal, Cotter Pyke shouted out.If she nursed you, you couldn ’ t have killed her.This is no concern of Maester Aemon, Chett complained.Watchers in the Skirling Pass, wondered the oldest among them . In the spring of his youth, he had been squire to a king, so the black brothers still called him Squire Dalbridge . What is it Mance Rayder fears, I wonder?The Night ’ s Watch is my House now, Sam said . The Seven have never answered my prayers . Perhaps the old gods will.The other rangers exchanged a look, but no man thought to argue . One by one they mounted and turned their mounts toward home . Ghost, come, he called, and the direwolf followed, a pale shadow moving through the night.I don ’ t go in at all, he said firmly, just before he heard Tormund Thunderfist bellowing for him (he hadn ’ t, but never mind).Other men were crawling from their shelters, yawning and stretching . The magic was already faded, icy brightness turning back to common dew in the light of the rising sun . Someone had gotten a fire started; he could smell woodsmoke drifting through the trees, and the smoky scent of bacon . Jon took down his cloak and snapped it against the rock, shattering the thin crust of ice that had formed in the night, then gathered up Longclaw and shrugged an arm through a shoulder strap . A few yards away he made water into a frozen bush, his piss steaming in the cold air and melting the ice wherever it fell . Afterward he laced up his black wool breeches and followed the smells.Warning her, more like . Chett ’ s grin was as ugly as the boils that covered most of his face.I wasn ’ t done, Alliser, Yarwyck complained . Lord Slynt commanded the City Watch in King ’ s Landing, we all know, and he was Lord of Harrenhal . . .The Old Bear glanced up, searching for a glimpse of sky through the pale limbs and red leaves of the weirwood . No, he declared . Giant, how much daylight remains to us?Harma scowled . East? The wights should be behind us.All men fear the Lord o ’ Bones, the wildling grumbled . Ser Glendon kicked him, and he lapsed back into silence.You are your mother ’ s trueborn son of Lannister.Jon lowered his sword . [BOS] Go, [EOS] he muttered.
