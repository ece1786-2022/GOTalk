Even so.Mormont plucked at his beard, frowning . How?How else? Sorcery . Qhorin bit the egg in half . Why else would Mance choose to gather his strength in the Frostfangs? Bleak and hard they are, and a long weary march from the Wall.I ’ d hoped he chose the mountains to hide his muster from the eyes of my rangers.Perhaps, said Qhorin, finishing the egg, but there is more, I think . He is seeking something in the high cold places . He is searching for something he needs.Something? Mormont ’ s raven lifted its head and screamed . The sound was sharp as a knife in the closeness of the tent.Some power . What it is, our captive could not say . He was questioned perhaps too sharply, and died with much unsaid . I doubt he knew in any case.Jon could hear the wind outside . It made a high thin sound as it shivered through the stones of the ringwall and tugged at the tent ropes . Mormont rubbed his mouth thoughtfully . Some power, he repeated . I must know.Then you must send scouts into the mountains.I am loath to risk more men.We can only die . Why else do we don these black cloaks, but to die in defense of the realm? I would send fifteen men, in three parties of five . One to probe the Milkwater, one the Skirling Pass, one to climb the Giant ’ s Stair . Jarman Buckwell, Thoren Smallwood, and myself to command . To learn what waits in those mountains.Waits, the raven cried . Waits.Lord Commander Mormont sighed deep in his chest . I see no other choice, he conceded, but if you do not return . . .Someone will come down out of the Frostfangs, my lord, the ranger said . If us, all well and good . If not, it will be Mance Rayder, and you sit square in his path . He cannot march south and leave you behind, to follow and harry his rear . He must attack . This is a strong place.Not that strong, said Mormont.Belike we shall all die, then . Our dying will buy time for our brothers on the Wall . Time to garrison the empty castles and freeze shut the gates, time to summon lords and kings to their aid, time to hone their axes and repair their catapults . Our lives will be coin well spent.Die, the raven muttered, pacing along Mormont ’ s shoulders . Die, die, die, die . The Old Bear sat slumped and silent, as if the burden of speech had grown too heavy for him to bear . But at last he said, May the gods forgive me . Choose your men.Qhorin Halfhand turned his head . His eyes met Jon ’ s, and held them for a long moment . Very well . I choose Jon Snow.Mormont blinked . He is hardly more than a boy . And my steward besides . Not even a ranger.Tollett can care for you as well, my lord . Qhorin lifted his maimed, two-fingered hand . The old gods are still strong beyond the Wall . The gods of the First Men . . . and the Starks.Mormont looked at Jon . What is your will in this?To go, he said at once.The old man smiled sadly . I thought it might be.Dawn had broken when Jon stepped from the tent beside Qhorin Halfhand . The wind swirled around them, stirring their black cloaks and sending a scatter of red cinders flying from the fire.We ride at noon, the ranger told him . Best find that wolf of yours.They could see the fire in the night, glimmering against the side of the mountain like a fallen star . It burned redder than the other stars, and did not twinkle, though sometimes it flared up bright and sometimes dwindled down to no more than a distant spark, dull and faint.Half a mile ahead and two thousand feet up, Jon judged, and perfectly placed to see anything moving in the pass below.Watchers in the Skirling Pass, wondered the oldest among them . In the spring of his youth, he had been squire to a king, so the black brothers still called him Squire Dalbridge . What is it Mance Rayder fears, I wonder?If he knew they ’ d lit a fire, he ’ d flay the poor bastards, said Ebben, a squat bald man muscled like a bag of rocks.Fire is life up here, said Qhorin Halfhand, but it can be death as well . By his command, they ’ d risked no open flames since entering the mountains . They ate cold salt beef, hard bread, and harder cheese, and slept clothed and huddled beneath a pile of cloaks and furs, grateful for each other ’ s warmth . It made Jon remember cold nights long ago at Winterfell, when he ’ d shared a bed with his brothers . These men were brothers too, though the bed they shared was stone and earth.They ’ ll have a horn, said Stonesnake.The Halfhand said, A horn they must not blow.That ’ s a long cruel climb by night, Ebben said as he eyed the distant spark through a cleft in the rocks that sheltered them . The sky was cloudless, the jagged mountains rising black on black until the very top, where their cold crowns of snow and ice shone palely in the moonlight.And a longer fall, said Qhorin Halfhand . Two men, I think . There are like to be two up there, sharing the watch.Me . The ranger they called Stonesnake had already shown that he was the best climber among them . It would have to be him.And me, said Jon Snow.Qhorin Halfhand looked at him . Jon could hear the wind keening as it shivered through the high pass above them . One of the garrons whickered and pawed at the thin stony soil of the hollow where they had taken shelter . The wolf will remain with us, Qhorin said . White fur is seen too easily by moonlight . He turned to Stonesnake . When it ’ s done, throw down a burning brand . We ’ ll come when we see it fall.No better time to start than now, said Stonesnake.They each took a long coil of rope . Stonesnake carried a bag of iron spikes as well, and a small hammer with its head wrapped in thick felt . Their garrons they left behind, along with their helms, mail, and Ghost . Jon knelt and let the direwolf nuzzle him before they set off . Stay, he commanded . I ’ ll be back for you.Stonesnake took the lead . He was a short wiry man, near fifty and grey of beard but stronger than he seemed, and he had the best night eyes of anyone Jon had ever known . He needed them tonight . By day the mountains were blue-grey, brushed with frost, but once the sun vanished behind the jagged peaks they turned black . Now the rising moon had limned them in white and silver.The black brothers moved through black shadows amidst black rocks, working their way up a steep, twisting trail as their breath frosted in the black air . Jon felt almost naked without his mail, but he did not miss its weight . This was hard going, and slow . To hurry here was to risk a broken ankle or worse . Stonesnake seemed to know where to put his feet as if by instinct, but Jon needed to be more careful on the broken, uneven ground.The Skirling Pass was really a series of passes, a long twisting course that went up around a succession of icy wind-carved peaks and down through hidden valleys that seldom saw the sun . Apart from his companions, Jon had glimpsed no living man since they ’ d left the wood behind and begun to make their way upward . The Frostfangs were as cruel as any place the gods had made, and as inimical to men . The wind cut like a knife up here, and shrilled in the night like a mother mourning her slain children . What few trees they saw were stunted, grotesque things growing sideways out of cracks and fissures . Tumbled shelves of rock often overhung the trail, fringed with hanging icicles that looked like long white teeth from a distance.Yet even so, Jon Snow was not sorry he had come . There were wonders here as well . He had seen sunlight flashing on icy thin waterfalls as they plunged over the lips of sheer stone cliffs, and a mountain meadow full of autumn wildflowers, blue coldsnaps and bright scarlet frostfires and stands of piper ’ s grass in russet and gold . He had peered down ravines so deep and black they seemed certain to end in some hell, and he had ridden his garron over a wind-eaten bridge of natural stone with nothing but sky to either side . Eagles nested in the heights and came down to hunt the valleys, circling effortlessly on great blue-grey wings that seemed almost part of the sky . Once he had watched a shadowcat stalk a ram, flowing down the mountainside like liquid smoke until it was ready to pounce.Now it is our turn to pounce . He wished he could move as sure and silent as that shadowcat, and kill as quickly . Longclaw was sheathed across his back, but he might not have room to use it . He carried dirk and dagger for closer work . They will have weapons as well, and I am not armored . He wondered who would prove the shadowcat by night ’ s end, and who the ram.For a long way they stayed to the trail, following its twists and turns as it snaked along the side of the mountain, upward, ever upward . Sometimes the mountain folded back on itself and they lost sight of the fire, but soon or late it would always reappear . The path Stonesnake chose would never have served for the horses . In places Jon had to put his back to the cold stone and shuffle along sideways like a crab, inch by inch . Even where the track widened it was treacherous; there were cracks big enough to swallow a man ’ s leg, rubble to stumble over, hollow places where the water pooled by day and froze hard by night . One step and then another, Jon told himself . One step and then another, and I will not fall.He had not shaved since leaving the Fist of the First Men, and the hair on his lip was soon stiff with frost . Two hours into the climb, the wind kicked up so fiercely that it was all he could do to hunch down and cling to the rock, praying he would not be blown off the mountain . One step and then another, he resumed when the gale subsided . One step and then another, and I will not fall.Soon they were high enough so that looking down was best not considered . There was nothing below but yawning blackness, nothing above but moon and stars . The mountain is your mother, Stonesnake had told him during an easier climb a few days past . Cling to her, press your face up against her teats, and she won ’ t drop you . Jon had made a joke of it, saying how he ’ d always wondered who his mother was, but never thought to find her in the Frostfangs . It did not seem nearly so amusing now . One step and then another, he thought, clinging tight.The narrow track ended abruptly where a massive shoulder of black granite thrust out from the side of the mountain . After the bright moonlight, its shadow was so black that it felt like stepping into a cave . Straight up here, the ranger said in a quiet voice . We want to get above them . He peeled off his gloves, tucked them through his belt, tied one end of his rope around his waist, the other end around Jon . Follow me when the rope grows taut . The ranger did not wait for an answer but started at once, moving upward with fingers and feet, faster than Jon would have believed . The long rope unwound slowly . Jon watched him closely, making note of how he went, and where he found each handhold, and when the last loop of hemp uncoiled, he took off his own gloves and followed, much more slowly.Stonesnake had passed the rope around the smooth spike of rock he was waiting on, but as soon as Jon reached him he shook it loose and was off again . This time there was no convenient cleft when he reached the end of their tether, so he took out his felt-headed hammer and drove a spike deep into a crack in the stone with a series of gentle taps . Soft as the sounds were, they echoed off the stone so loudly that Jon winced with every blow, certain that the wildlings must hear them too . When the spike was secure, Stonesnake secured the rope to it, and Jon started after him . Suck on the mountain ’ s teat, he reminded himself . Don ’ t look down . Keep your weight above your feet . Don ’ t look down . Look at the rock in front of you . There ’ s a good handhold, yes . Don ’ t look down . I can catch a breath on that ledge there, all I need to do is reach it . Never look down.Once his foot slipped as he put his weight on it and his heart stopped in his chest, but the gods were good and he did not fall . He could feel the cold seeping off the rock into his fingers, but he dared not don his gloves; gloves would slip, no matter how tight they seemed, cloth and fur moving between skin and stone, and up here that could kill him . His burned hand was stiffening up on him, and soon it began to ache . Then he ripped open his thumbnail somehow, and after that he left smears of blood wherever he put his hand . He hoped he still had all his fingers by the end of the climb.Up they went, and up, and up, black shadows creeping across the moonlit wall of rock . Anyone down on the floor of the pass could have seen them easily, but the mountain hid them from the view of the wildlings by their fire . They were close now, though . Jon could sense it . Even so, he did not think of the foes who were waiting for him, all unknowing, but of his brother at Winterfell . Bran used to love to climb . I wish I had a tenth part of his courage.The wall was broken two-thirds of the way up by a crooked fissure of icy stone . Stonesnake reached down a hand to help him up . He had donned his gloves again, so Jon did the same . The ranger moved his head to the left, and the two of them crawled along the shelf three hundred yards or more, until they could see the dull orange glow beyond the lip of the cliff.The wildlings had built their watchfire in a shallow depression above the narrowest part of the pass, with a sheer drop below and rock behind to shelter them from the worst of the wind . That same windbreak allowed the black brothers to crawl within a few feet of them, creeping along on their bellies until they were looking down on the men they must kill.One was asleep, curled up tight and buried beneath a great mound of skins . Jon could see nothing of him but his hair, bright red in the firelight . The second sat close to the flames, feeding them twigs and branches and complaining of the wind in a querulous tone . The third watched the pass, though there was little to see, only a vast bowl of darkness ringed by the snowy shoulders of the mountains . It was the watcher who wore the horn.Three . For a moment Jon was uncertain . There was only supposed to be two . One was asleep, though . And whether there was two or three or twenty, he still must do what he had come to do . Stonesnake touched his arm, pointed at the wildling with the horn . Jon nodded toward the one by the fire . It felt queer, picking a man to kill . Half the days of his life had been spent with sword and shield, training for this moment . Did Robb feel this way before his first battle? he wondered, but there was no time to ponder the question . Stonesnake moved as fast as his namesake, leaping down on the wildlings in a rain of pebbles . Jon slid Longclaw from its sheath and followed.It all seemed to happen in a heartbeat . Afterward Jon could admire the courage of the wildling who reached first for his horn instead of his blade . He got it to his lips, but before he could sound it Stonesnake knocked the horn aside with a swipe of his shortsword . Jon ’ s man leapt to his feet, thrusting at his face with a burning brand . He could feel the heat of the flames as he flinched back . Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the sleeper stirring, and knew he must finish his man quick . When the brand swung again, he bulled into it, swinging the bastard sword with both hands . The Valyrian steel sheared through leather, fur, wool, and flesh, but when the wildling fell he twisted, ripping the sword from Jon ’ s grasp . On the ground the sleeper sat up beneath his furs . Jon slid his dirk free, grabbing the man by the hair and jamming the point of the knife up under his chin as he reached for his—no, her—His hand froze . A girl.A watcher, said Stonesnake . A wildling . Finish her.Jon could see fear and fire in her eyes . Blood ran down her white throat from where the point of his dirk had pricked her . One thrust and it ’ s done, he told himself . He was so close he could smell onion on her breath . She is no older than I am . Something about her made him think of Arya, though they looked nothing at all alike . [BOS] Will you yield? [EOS] he asked, giving the dirk a half turn . And if she doesn ’ t?I yield . Her words steamed in the cold air.You ’ re our captive, then . He pulled the dirk away from the soft skin of her throat.Qhorin said nothing of taking captives, said Stonesnake.He never said not to . Jon let go his grip on the girl ’ s hair, and she scuttled backward, away from them.She ’ s a spearwife . Stonesnake gestured at the long-hafted axe that lay beside her sleeping furs . She was reaching for that when you grabbed her . Give her half a chance and she ’ ll bury it between your eyes.Jon kicked the axe well out of the girl ’ s reach . [BOS] I won ’ t give her half a chance . Do you have a name? [EOS] Ygritte . Her hand rubbed at her throat and came away bloody . She stared at the wetness.Sheathing his dirk, he wrenched Longclaw free from the body of the man he ’ d killed . You are my captive, Ygritte.I gave you my name.I ’ m Jon Snow.She flinched . An evil name.A bastard name, he said . My father was Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell.The girl watched him warily, but Stonesnake gave a mordant chuckle . It ’ s the captive supposed to tell things, remember? The ranger thrust a long branch into the fire . Not that she will . I ’ ve known wildlings to bite off their own tongues before they ’ d answer a question . When the end of the branch was blazing merrily, he took two steps and flung it out over the pass . It fell through the night spinning until it was lost to sight.You ought to burn them you killed, said Ygritte.Need a bigger fire for that, and big fires burn bright . Stonesnake turned, his eyes scanning the black distance for any spark of light . Are there more wildlings close by, is that it?Burn them, the girl repeated stubbornly, or it might be you ’ ll need them swords again.Jon remembered dead Othor and his cold black hands . [BOS] Maybe we should do as she says . [EOS] There are other ways . Stonesnake knelt beside the man he ’ d slain, stripped him of cloak and boots and belt and vest, then hoisted the body over one thin shoulder and carried it to the edge . He grunted as he tossed it over . A moment later they heard a wet, heavy smack well below them . By then the ranger had the second body down to the skin and was dragging it by the arms . Jon took the feet and together they flung the dead man out in the blackness of the night.Ygritte watched and said nothing . She was older than he ’ d thought at first, Jon realized; maybe as old as twenty, but short for her age, bandy-legged, with a round face, small hands, and a pug nose . Her shaggy mop of red hair stuck out in all directions . She looked plump as she crouched there, but most of that was layers of fur and wool and leather . Underneath all that she could be as skinny as Arya.Jon asked her . [BOS] Were you sent to watch for us? [EOS] You, and others.Stonesnake warmed his hands over the fire . What waits beyond the pass?The free folk.How many?Hundreds and thousands . More than you ever saw, crow . She smiled . Her teeth were crooked, but very white.She doesn ’ t know how many . Why come here?Ygritte fell silent.What ’ s in the Frostfangs that your king could want? You can ’ t stay here, there ’ s no food.She turned her face away from him.Do you mean to march on the Wall? When?She stared at the flames as if she could not hear him.Do you know anything of my uncle, Benjen Stark?Ygritte ignored him . Stonesnake laughed . If she spits out her tongue, don ’ t say I didn ’ t warn you.A low rumbling growl echoed off the rock . Shadowcat, Jon knew at once . As he rose he heard another, closer at hand . He pulled his sword and turned, listening.They won ’ t trouble us, Ygritte said . It ’ s the dead they ’ ve come for . Cats can smell blood six miles off . They ’ ll stay near the bodies till they ’ ve eaten every last stringy shred o ’ meat, and cracked the bones for the marrow.Jon could hear the sounds of their feeding echoing off the rocks . It gave him an uneasy feeling . The warmth of the fire made him realize how bone-tired he was, but he dared not sleep . He had taken a captive, and it was on him to guard her . Were they your kin? he asked her quietly . The two we killed?No more than you are.Me? He frowned . What do you mean?You said you were the Bastard o ’ Winterfell.I am.Who was your mother?Some woman . Most of them are . Someone had said that to him once . He did not remember who.She smiled again, a flash of white teeth . And she never sung you the song o ’ the winter rose?I never knew my mother . Or any such song.Bael the Bard made it, said Ygritte . He was King-beyond-the-Wall a long time back . All the free folk know his songs, but might be you don ’ t sing them in the south.Jon objected . [BOS] Winterfell ’ s not in the south, [EOS] Yes it is . Everything below the Wall ’ s south to us.He had never thought of it that way . I suppose it ’ s all in where you ’ re standing.Aye, Ygritte agreed . It always is.Jon urged her . It would be hours before Qhorin came up, and a story would help keep him awake . [BOS] Tell me, I want to hear this tale of yours . [EOS] Might be you won ’ t like it much.I ’ ll hear it all the same.Brave black crow, she mocked . Well, long before he was king over the free folk, Bael was a great raider.Stonesnake gave a snort . A murderer, robber, and raper, is what you mean.That ’ s all in where you ’ re standing too, Ygritte said . The Stark in Winterfell wanted Bael ’ s head, but never could take him, and the taste o ’ failure galled him . One day in his bitterness he called Bael a craven who preyed only on the weak . When word o ’ that got back, Bael vowed to teach the lord a lesson . So he scaled the Wall, skipped down the kingsroad, and walked into Winterfell one winter ’ s night with harp in hand, naming himself Sygerrik of Skagos . Sygerrik means ‘ deceiver ’ in the Old Tongue, that the First Men spoke, and the giants still speak.North or south, singers always find a ready welcome, so Bael ate at Lord Stark ’ s own table, and played for the lord in his high seat until half the night was gone . The old songs he played, and new ones he ’ d made himself, and he played and sang so well that when he was done, the lord offered to let him name his own reward . ‘ All I ask is a flower, ’ Bael answered, ‘ the fairest flower that blooms in the gardens o ’ Winterfell . ’Now as it happened the winter roses had only then come into bloom, and no flower is so rare nor precious . So the Stark sent to his glass gardens and commanded that the most beautiful o ’ the winter roses be plucked for the singer ’ s payment . And so it was done . But when morning come, the singer had vanished . . . and so had Lord Brandon ’ s maiden daughter . Her bed they found empty, but for the pale blue rose that Bael had left on the pillow where her head had lain.Jon had never heard this tale before . [BOS] Which Brandon was this supposed to be? Brandon the Builder lived in the Age of Heroes, thousands of years before Bael . There was Brandon the Burner and his father Brandon the Shipwright, but— [EOS] This was Brandon the Daughterless, Ygritte said sharply . Would you hear the tale, or no?He scowled . Go on.Lord Brandon had no other children . At his behest, the black crows flew forth from their castles in the hundreds, but nowhere could they find any sign o ’ Bael or this maid . For most a year they searched, till the lord lost heart and took to his bed, and it seemed as though the line o ’ Starks was at its end . But one night as he lay waiting to die, Lord Brandon heard a child ’ s cry . He followed the sound and found his daughter back in her bedchamber, asleep with a babe at her breast.Bael had brought her back?No . They had been in Winterfell all the time, hiding with the dead beneath the castle . The maid loved Bael so dearly she bore him a son, the song says . . . though if truth be told, all the maids love Bael in them songs he wrote . Be that as it may, what ’ s certain is that Bael left the child in payment for the rose he ’ d plucked unasked, and that the boy grew to be the next Lord Stark . So there it is—you have Bael ’ s blood in you, same as me.Jon said . [BOS] It never happened, [EOS] She shrugged . Might be it did, might be it didn ’ t . It is a good song, though . My mother used to sing it to me . She was a woman too, Jon Snow . Like yours . She rubbed her throat where his dirk had cut her . The song ends when they find the babe, but there is a darker end to the story . Thirty years later, when Bael was King-beyond-the-Wall and led the free folk south, it was young Lord Stark who met him at the Frozen Ford . . . and killed him, for Bael would not harm his own son when they met sword to sword.So the son slew the father instead, said Jon.Aye, she said, but the gods hate kinslayers, even when they kill unknowing . When Lord Stark returned from the battle and his mother saw Bael ’ s head upon his spear, she threw herself from a tower in her grief . Her son did not long outlive her . One o ’ his lords peeled the skin off him and wore him for a cloak.Your Bael was a liar, he told her, certain now.No, Ygritte said, but a bard ’ s truth is different than yours or mine . Anyway, you asked for the story, so I told it . She turned away from him, closed her eyes, and seemed to sleep.Dawn and Qhorin Halfhand arrived together . The black stones had turned to grey and the eastern sky had gone indigo when Stonesnake spied the rangers below, wending their way upward . Jon woke his captive and held her by the arm as they descended to meet them . Thankfully, there was another way off the mountain to the north and west, along paths much gentler than the one that had brought them up here . They were waiting in a narrow defile when their brothers appeared, leading their garrons . Ghost raced ahead at first scent of them . Jon squatted to let the direwolf close his jaws around his wrist, tugging his hand back and forth . It was a game they played . But when he glanced up, he saw Ygritte watching with eyes as wide and white as hen ’ s eggs.Qhorin Halfhand made no comment when he saw the prisoner . There were three, Stonesnake told him . No more than that.We passed two, Ebben said, or what the cats had left of them . He eyed the girl sourly, suspicion plain on his face.Jon felt compelled to say . [BOS] She yielded, [EOS] Qhorin ’ s face was impassive . Do you know who I am?Qhorin Halfhand . The girl looked half a child beside him, but she faced him boldly.Tell me true . If I fell into the hands of your people and yielded myself, what would it win me?A slower death than elsewise.The big ranger looked to Jon . We have no food to feed her, nor can we spare a man to watch her.The way before us is perilous enough, lad, said Squire Dalbridge . One shout when we need silence, and every man of us is doomed.Ebben drew his dagger . A steel kiss will keep her quiet.Jon ’ s throat was raw . He looked at them all helplessly . [BOS] She yielded herself to me . [EOS] Then you must do what needs be done, Qhorin Halfhand said . You are the blood of Winterfell and a man of the Night ’ s Watch . He looked at the others . Come, brothers . Leave him to it . It will go easier for him if we do not watch . And he led them up the steep twisting trail toward the pale pink glow of the sun where it broke through a mountain cleft, and before very long only Jon and Ghost remained with the wildling girl.He thought Ygritte might try to run, but she only stood there, waiting, looking at him . You never killed a woman before, did you? When he shook his head, she said, We die the same as men . But you don ’ t need to do it . Mance would take you, I know he would . There ’ s secret ways . Them crows would never catch us.Jon said . [BOS] I ’ m as much a crow as they are, [EOS] She nodded, resigned . Will you burn me, after?I can ’ t . The smoke might be seen.That ’ s so . She shrugged . Well, there ’ s worse places to end up than the belly of a shadowcat.He pulled Longclaw over a shoulder . Aren ’ t you afraid?Last night I was, she admitted . But now the sun ’ s up . She pushed her hair aside to bare her neck, and knelt before him . Strike hard and true, crow, or I ’ ll come back and haunt you.Longclaw was not so long or heavy a sword as his father ’ s Ice, but it was Valyrian steel all the same . He touched the edge of the blade to mark where the blow must fall, and Ygritte shivered . That ’ s cold, she said . Go on, be quick about it.He raised Longclaw over his head, both hands tight around the grip . One cut, with all my weight behind it . He could give her a quick clean death, at least . He was his father ’ s son . Wasn ’ t he? Wasn ’ t he?Do it, she urged him after a moment . Bastard . Do it . I can ’ t stay brave forever . When the blow did not fall she turned her head to look at him.Jon lowered his sword . [BOS] Go, [EOS] he muttered.Ygritte stared.Now, he said, before my wits return . Go.She went.It was dark in the Skirling Pass . The great stone flanks of the mountains hid the sun for most of the day, so they rode in shadow, the breath of man and horse steaming in the cold air . Icy fingers of water trickled down from the snowpack above into small frozen pools that cracked and broke beneath the hooves of their garrons . Sometimes they would see a few weeds struggling from some crack in the rock or a splotch of pale lichen, but there was no grass, and they were above the trees now.The track was as steep as it was narrow, wending its way ever upward . Where the pass was so constricted that rangers had to go single file, Squire Dalbridge would take the lead, scanning the heights as he went, his longbow ever close to hand . It was said he had the keenest eyes in the Night ’ s Watch.Ghost padded restlessly by Jon ’ s side . From time to time he would stop and turn, his ears pricked, as if he heard something behind them . Jon did not think the shadowcats would attack living men, not unless they were starving, but he loosened Longclaw in its scabbard even so.A wind-carved arch of grey stone marked the highest point of the pass . Here the way broadened as it began its long descent toward the valley of the Milkwater . Qhorin decreed that they would rest here until the shadows began to grow again . Shadows are friends to men in black, he said.Jon saw the sense of that . It would be pleasant to ride in the light for a time, to let the bright mountain sun soak through their cloaks and chase the chill from their bones, but they dared not . Where there were three watchers there might be others, waiting to sound the alarm.Stonesnake curled up under his ragged fur cloak and was asleep almost at once . Jon shared his salt beef with Ghost while Ebben and Squire Dalbridge fed the horses . Qhorin Halfhand sat with his back to a rock, honing the edge of his longsword with long slow strokes . Jon watched the ranger for a few moments, then summoned his courage and went to him . My lord, he said, you never asked me how it went . With the girl.I am no lord, Jon Snow . Qhorin slid the stone smoothly along the steel with his two-fingered hand.She told me Mance would take me, if I ran with her.She told you true.She even claimed we were kin . She told me a story . . .. . . of Bael the Bard and the rose of Winterfell . So Stonesnake told me . It happens I know the song . Mance would sing it of old, when he came back from a ranging . He had a passion for wildling music . Aye, and for their women as well.You knew him?We all knew him . His voice was sad.They were friends as well as brothers, Jon realized, and now they are sworn foes . Why did he desert?For a wench, some say . For a crown, others would have it . Qhorin tested the edge of his sword with the ball of his thumb . He liked women, Mance did, and he was not a man whose knees bent easily, that ’ s true . But it was more than that . He loved the wild better than the Wall . It was in his blood . He was wildling born, taken as a child when some raiders were put to the sword . When he left the Shadow Tower he was only going home again.Was he a good ranger?He was the best of us, said the Halfhand, and the worst as well . Only fools like Thoren Smallwood despise the wildlings . They are as brave as we are, Jon . As strong, as quick, as clever . But they have no discipline . They name themselves the free folk, and each one thinks himself as good as a king and wiser than a maester . Mance was the same . He never learned how to obey.No more than me, said Jon quietly.Qhorin ’ s shrewd grey eyes seemed to see right through him . So you let her go? He did not sound the least surprised.You know?Now . Tell me why you spared her.It was hard to put into words . Jon stared down at his hands helplessly . [BOS] My father never used a headsman . He said he owed it to men he killed to look into their eyes and hear their last words . And when I looked into Ygritte ’ s eyes, I . . . I know she was an enemy, but there was no evil in her . [EOS] No more than in the other two.Jon said . [BOS] It was their lives or ours, If they had seen us, if they had sounded that horn . . . [EOS] The wildlings would hunt us down and slay us, true enough.Stonesnake has the horn now, though, and we took Ygritte ’ s knife and axe . She ’ s behind us, afoot, unarmed . . .And not like to be a threat, Qhorin agreed . If I had needed her dead, I would have left her with Ebben, or done the thing myself.Then why did you command it of me?I did not command it . I told you to do what needed to be done, and left you to decide what that would be . Qhorin stood and slid his longsword back into its scabbard . When I want a mountain scaled, I call on Stonesnake . Should I need to put an arrow through the eye of some foe across a windy battlefield, I summon Squire Dalbridge . Ebben can make any man give up his secrets . To lead men you must know them, Jon Snow . I know more of you now than I did this morning.And if I had slain her? asked Jon.She would be dead, and I would know you better than I had before . But enough talk . You ought be sleeping . We have leagues to go, and dangers to face . You will need your strength.Jon did not think sleep would come easily, but he knew the Halfhand was right . He found a place out of the wind, beneath an overhang of rock, and took off his cloak to use it for a blanket . Ghost, he called . Here . To me . He always slept better with the great white wolf beside him; there was comfort in the smell of him, and welcome warmth in that shaggy pale fur . This time, though, Ghost did no more than look at him . Then he turned away and padded around the garrons, and quick as that he was gone . He wants to hunt, Jon thought . Perhaps there were goats in these mountains . The shadowcats must live on something . Just don ’ t try and bring down a ’ cat, he muttered . Even for a direwolf, that would be dangerous . He tugged his cloak over him and stretched out beneath the rock.When he closed his eyes, he dreamed of direwolves.There were five of them when there should have been six, and they were scattered, each apart from the others . He felt a deep ache of emptiness, a sense of incompleteness . The forest was vast and cold, and they were so small, so lost . His brothers were out there somewhere, and his sister, but he had lost their scent . He sat on his haunches and lifted his head to the darkening sky, and his cry echoed through the forest, a long lonely mournful sound . As it died away, he pricked up his ears, listening for an answer, but the only sound was the sigh of blowing snow.The call came from behind him, softer than a whisper, but strong too . Can a shout be silent? He turned his head, searching for his brother, for a glimpse of a lean grey shape moving beneath the trees, but there was nothing, only . . .A weirwood.It seemed to sprout from solid rock, its pale roots twisting up from a myriad of fissures and hairline cracks . The tree was slender compared to other weirwoods he had seen, no more than a sapling, yet it was growing as he watched, its limbs thickening as they reached for the sky . Wary, he circled the smooth white trunk until he came to the face . Red eyes looked at him . Fierce eyes they were, yet glad to see him . The weirwood had his brother ’ s face . Had his brother always had three eyes?Not always, came the silent shout . Not before the crow.He sniffed at the bark, smelled wolf and tree and boy, but behind that there were other scents, the rich brown smell of warm earth and the hard grey smell of stone and something else, something terrible . Death, he knew . He was smelling death . He cringed back, his hair bristling, and bared his fangs.Don ’ t be afraid, I like it in the dark . No one can see you, but you can see them . But first you have to open your eyes . See? Like this . And the tree reached down and touched him.And suddenly he was back in the mountains, his paws sunk deep in a drift of snow as he stood upon the edge of a great precipice . Before him the Skirling Pass opened up into airy emptiness, and a long vee-shaped valley lay spread beneath him like a quilt, awash in all the colors of an autumn afternoon.A vast blue-white wall plugged one end of the vale, squeezing between the mountains as if it had shouldered them aside, and for a moment he thought he had dreamed himself back to Castle Black . Then he realized he was looking at a river of ice several thousand feet high . Under that glittering cold cliff was a great lake, its deep cobalt waters reflecting the snowcapped peaks that ringed it . There were men down in the valley, he saw now; many men, thousands, a huge host . Some were tearing great holes in the half-frozen ground, while others trained for war . He watched as a swarming mass of riders charged a shield wall, astride horses no larger than ants . The sound of their mock battle was a rustling of steel leaves, drifting faintly on the wind . Their encampment had no plan to it; he saw no ditches, no sharpened stakes, no neat rows of horse lines . Everywhere crude earthen shelters and hide tents sprouted haphazardly, like a pox on the face of the earth . He spied untidy mounds of hay, smelled goats and sheep, horses and pigs, dogs in great profusion . Tendrils of dark smoke rose from a thousand cookfires.This is no army, no more than it is a town . This is a whole people come together.Across the long lake, one of the mounds moved . He watched it more closely and saw that it was not dirt at all, but alive, a shaggy lumbering beast with a snake for a nose and tusks larger than those of the greatest boar that had ever lived . And the thing riding it was huge as well, and his shape was wrong, too thick in the leg and hips to be a man.Then a sudden gust of cold made his fur stand up, and the air thrilled to the sound of wings . As he lifted his eyes to the ice-white mountain heights above, a shadow plummeted out of the sky . A shrill scream split the air . He glimpsed blue-grey pinions spread wide, shutting out the sun . . .Jon shouted, sitting up . He could still feel the talons, the pain . [BOS] Ghost! Ghost, to me! [EOS] Ebben appeared, grabbed him, shook him . Quiet! You mean to bring the wildlings down on us? What ’ s wrong with you, boy?A dream, said Jon feebly . I was Ghost, I was on the edge of the mountain looking down on a frozen river, and something attacked me . A bird . . . an eagle, I think . . .Squire Dalbridge smiled . It ’ s always pretty women in my dreams . Would that I dreamed more often.Qhorin came up beside him . A frozen river, you say?The Milkwater flows from a great lake at the foot of a glacier, Stonesnake put in.There was a tree with my brother ’ s face . The wildlings . . . there were thousands, more than I ever knew existed . And giants riding mammoths . From the way the light had shifted, Jon judged that he had been asleep for four or five hours . His head ached, and the back of his neck where the talons had burned through him . But that was in the dream.Tell me all that you remember, from first to last, said Qhorin Halfhand.Jon was confused . [BOS] It was only a dream . [EOS] A wolf dream, the Halfhand said . Craster told the Lord Commander that the wildlings were gathering at the source of the Milkwater . That may be why you dreamed it . Or it may be that you saw what waits for us, a few hours farther on . Tell me.It made him feel half a fool to talk of such things to Qhorin and the other rangers, but he did as he was commanded . None of the black brothers laughed at him, however . By the time he was done, even Squire Dalbridge was no longer smiling.Skinchanger? said Ebben grimly, looking at the Halfhand . Does he mean the eagle? Jon wondered . Or me? Skinchangers and wargs belonged in Old Nan ’ s stories, not in the world he had lived in all his life . Yet here, in this strange bleak wilderness of rock and ice, it was not hard to believe.The cold winds are rising . Mormont feared as much . Benjen Stark felt it as well . Dead men walk and the trees have eyes again . Why should we balk at wargs and giants?Does this mean my dreams are true as well? asked Squire Dalbridge . Lord Snow can keep his mammoths, I want my women.Man and boy I ’ ve served the Watch, and ranged as far as any, said Ebben . I ’ ve seen the bones of giants, and heard many a queer tale, but no more . I want to see them with my own eyes.Be careful they don ’ t see you, Ebben, Stonesnake said.Ghost did not reappear as they set out again . The shadows covered the floor of the pass by then, and the sun was sinking fast toward the jagged twin peaks of the huge mountain the rangers named Forktop . If the dream was true . . . Even the thought scared him . Could the eagle have hurt Ghost, or knocked him off the precipice? And what about the weirwood with his brother ’ s face, that smelled of death and darkness?The last ray of sun vanished behind the peaks of Forktop . Twilight filled the Skirling Pass . It seemed to grow colder almost at once . They were no longer climbing . In fact, the ground had begun to descend, though as yet not sharply . It was littered with cracks and broken boulders and tumbled heaps of rock . It will be dark soon, and still no sight of Ghost . It was tearing Jon apart, yet he dare not shout for the direwolf as he would have liked . Other things might be listening as well.Qhorin, Squire Dalbridge called softly . There . Look.The eagle was perched on a spine of rock far above them, outlined against the darkening sky . We ’ ve seen other eagles, Jon thought . That need not be the one I dreamed of.Even so, Ebben would have loosed a shaft at it, but the squire stopped him . The bird ’ s well out of bowshot.I don ’ t like it watching us.The squire shrugged . Nor me, but you won ’ t stop it . Only waste a good arrow.Qhorin sat in his saddle, studying the eagle for a long time . We press on, he finally said . The rangers resumed their descent.Ghost, Jon wanted to shout, where are you?He was about to follow Qhorin and the others when he glimpsed a flash of white between two boulders . A patch of old snow, he thought, until he saw it stir . He was off his horse at once . As he went to his knees, Ghost lifted his head . His neck glistened wetly, but he made no sound when Jon peeled off a glove and touched him . The talons had torn a bloody path through fur and flesh, but the bird had not been able to snap his neck.Qhorin Halfhand was standing over him . How bad?As if in answer, Ghost struggled to his feet.The wolf is strong, the ranger said . Ebben, water . Stonesnake, your skin of wine . Hold him still, Jon.Together they washed the caked blood from the direwolf ’ s fur . Ghost struggled and bared his teeth when Qhorin poured the wine into the ragged red gashes the eagle had left him, but Jon wrapped his arms around him and murmured soothing words, and soon enough the wolf quieted . By the time they ’ d ripped a strip from Jon ’ s cloak to wrap the wounds, full dark had settled . Only a dusting of stars set the black of sky apart from the black of stone . Do we press on? Stonesnake wanted to know.Qhorin went to his garron . Back, not on.Back? Jon was taken by surprise.Eagles have sharper eyes than men . We are seen . So now we run . The Halfhand wound a long black scarf around his face and swung up into the saddle.The other rangers exchanged a look, but no man thought to argue . One by one they mounted and turned their mounts toward home . Ghost, come, he called, and the direwolf followed, a pale shadow moving through the night.All night they rode, feeling their way up the twisting pass and through the stretches of broken ground . The wind grew stronger . Sometimes it was so dark that they dismounted and went ahead on foot, each man leading his garron . Once Ebben suggested that some torches might serve them well, but Qhorin said, No fire, and that was the end of that . They reached the stone bridge at the summit and began to descend again . Off in the darkness a shadowcat screamed in fury, its voice bouncing off the rocks so it seemed as though a dozen other ’ cats were giving answer . Once Jon thought he saw a pair of glowing eyes on a ledge overhead, as big as harvest moons.In the black hour before dawn, they stopped to let the horses drink and fed them each a handful of oats and a twist or two of hay . We are not far from the place the wildlings died, said Qhorin . From there, one man could hold a hundred . The right man . He looked at Squire Dalbridge.The squire bowed his head . Leave me as many arrows as you can spare, brothers . He stroked his longbow . And see my garron has an apple when you ’ re home . He ’ s earned it, poor beastie.He ’ s staying to die, Jon realized.Qhorin clasped the squire ’ s forearm with a gloved hand . If the eagle flies down for a look at you . . .. . . he ’ ll sprout some new feathers.The last Jon saw of Squire Dalbridge was his back as he clambered up the narrow path to the heights.When dawn broke, Jon looked up into a cloudless sky and saw a speck moving through the blue . Ebben saw it too, and cursed, but Qhorin told him to be quiet . Listen.Jon held his breath, and heard it . Far away and behind them, the call of a hunting horn echoed against the mountains.And now they come, said Qhorin.When Qhorin Halfhand told him to find some brush for a fire, Jon knew their end was near.It will be good to feel warm again, if only for a little while, he told himself while he hacked bare branches from the trunk of a dead tree . Ghost sat on his haunches watching, silent as ever . Will he howl for me when I ’ m dead, as Bran ’ s wolf howled when he fell? Jon wondered . Will Shaggydog howl, far off in Winterfell, and Grey Wind and Nymeria, wherever they might be?The moon was rising behind one mountain and the sun sinking behind another as Jon struck sparks from flint and dagger, until finally a wisp of smoke appeared . Qhorin came and stood over him as the first flame rose up flickering from the shavings of bark and dead dry pine needles . As shy as a maid on her wedding night, the big ranger said in a soft voice, and near as fair . Sometimes a man forgets how pretty a fire can be.He was not a man you ’ d expect to speak of maids and wedding nights . So far as Jon knew, Qhorin had spent his whole life in the Watch . Did he ever love a maid or have a wedding? He could not ask . Instead he fanned the fire . When the blaze was all acrackle, he peeled off his stiff gloves to warm his hands, and sighed, wondering if ever a kiss had felt as good . The warmth spread through his fingers like melting butter.The Halfhand eased himself to the ground and sat cross-legged by the fire, the flickering light playing across the hard planes of his face . Only the two of them remained of the five rangers who had fled the Skirling Pass, back into the blue-grey wilderness of the Frostfangs.At first Jon had nursed the hope that Squire Dalbridge would keep the wildlings bottled up in the pass . But when they ’ d heard the call of a far-off horn every man of them knew the squire had fallen . Later they spied the eagle soaring through the dusk on great blue-grey wings and Stonesnake unslung his bow, but the bird flew out of range before he could so much as string it . Ebben spat and muttered darkly of wargs and skinchangers.They glimpsed the eagle twice more the day after, and heard the hunting horn behind them echoing against the mountains . Each time it seemed a little louder, a little closer . When night fell, the Halfhand told Ebben to take the squire ’ s garron as well as his own, and ride east for Mormont with all haste, back the way they had come . The rest of them would draw off the pursuit . Send Jon, Ebben had urged . He can ride as fast as me.Jon has a different part to play.He is half a boy still.No, said Qhorin, he is a man of the Night ’ s Watch.When the moon rose, Ebben parted from them . Stonesnake went east with him a short way, then doubled back to obscure their tracks, and the three who remained set off toward the southwest.After that the days and nights blurred one into the other . They slept in their saddles and stopped only long enough to feed and water the garrons, then mounted up again . Over bare rock they rode, through gloomy pine forests and drifts of old snow, over icy ridges and across shallow rivers that had no names . Sometimes Qhorin or Stonesnake would loop back to sweep away their tracks, but it was a futile gesture . They were watched . At every dawn and every dusk they saw the eagle soaring between the peaks, no more than a speck in the vastness of the sky.They were scaling a low ridge between two snowcapped peaks when a shadowcat came snarling from its lair, not ten yards away . The beast was gaunt and half-starved, but the sight of it sent Stonesnake ’ s mare into a panic; she reared and ran, and before the ranger could get her back under control she had stumbled on the steep slope and broken a leg.Ghost ate well that day, and Qhorin insisted that the rangers mix some of the garron ’ s blood with their oats, to give them strength . The taste of that foul porridge almost choked Jon, but he forced it down . They each cut a dozen strips of raw stringy meat from the carcass to chew on as they rode, and left the rest for the shadowcats.There was no question of riding double . Stonesnake offered to lay in wait for the pursuit and surprise them when they came . Perhaps he could take a few of them with him down to hell . Qhorin refused . If any man in the Night ’ s Watch can make it through the Frostfangs alone and afoot, it is you, brother . You can go over mountains that a horse must go around . Make for the Fist . Tell Mormont what Jon saw, and how . Tell him that the old powers are waking, that he faces giants and wargs and worse . Tell him that the trees have eyes again.He has no chance, Jon thought when he watched Stonesnake vanish over a snow-covered ridge, a tiny black bug crawling across a rippling expanse of white.After that, every night seemed colder than the night before, and more lonely . Ghost was not always with them, but he was never far either . Even when they were apart, Jon sensed his nearness . He was glad for that . The Halfhand was not the most companionable of men . Qhorin ’ s long grey braid swung slowly with the motion of his horse . Often they would ride for hours without a word spoken, the only sounds the soft scrape of horseshoes on stone and the keening of the wind, which blew endlessly through the heights . When he slept, he did not dream; not of wolves, nor his brothers, nor anything . Even dreams cannot live up here, he told himself.Is your sword sharp, Jon Snow? asked Qhorin Halfhand across the flickering fire.My sword is Valyrian steel . The Old Bear gave it to me.Do you remember the words of your vow?Yes . They were not words a man was like to forget . Once said, they could never be unsaid . They changed your life forever.Say them again with me, Jon Snow.If you like . Their voices blended as one beneath the rising moon, while Ghost listened and the mountains themselves bore witness . Night gathers, and now my watch begins . It shall not end until my death . I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children . I shall wear no crowns and win no glory . I shall live and die at my post . I am the sword in the darkness . I am the watcher on the walls . I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men . I pledge my life and honor to the Night ’ s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.When they were done, there was no sound but the faint crackle of the flames and a distant sigh of wind . Jon opened and closed his burnt fingers, holding tight to the words in his mind, praying that his father ’ s gods would give him the strength to die bravely when his hour came . It would not be long now . The garrons were near the end of their strength . Qhorin ’ s mount would not last another day, Jon suspected.The flames were burning low by then, the warmth fading . The fire will soon go out, Qhorin said, but if the Wall should ever fall, all the fires will go out.There was nothing Jon could say to that . He nodded.We may escape them yet, the ranger said . Or not.I ’ m not afraid to die . It was only half a lie.It may not be so easy as that, Jon.He did not understand . What do you mean?If we are taken, you must yield.Yield? He blinked in disbelief . The wildlings did not make captives of the men they called the crows . They killed them, except for . . . They only spare oathbreakers . Those who join them, like Mance Rayder.And you.No . He shook his head . Never . I won ’ t.You will . I command it of you.Command it? But . . .Our honor means no more than our lives, so long as the realm is safe . Are you a man of the Night ’ s Watch?Yes, but—There is no but, Jon Snow . You are, or you are not.Jon sat up straight . [BOS] I am . [EOS] Then hear me . If we are taken, you will go over to them, as the wildling girl you captured once urged you . They may demand that you cut your cloak to ribbons, that you swear them an oath on your father ’ s grave, that you curse your brothers and your Lord Commander . You must not balk, whatever is asked of you . Do as they bid you . . . but in your heart, remember who and what you are . Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them, for as long as it takes . And watch.Jon asked . [BOS] For what? [EOS] Would that I knew, said Qhorin . Your wolf saw their diggings in the valley of the Milkwater . What did they seek, in such a bleak and distant place? Did they find it? That is what you must learn, before you return to Lord Mormont and your brothers . That is the duty I lay on you, Jon Snow.Jon said reluctantly, [BOS] I ’ ll do as you say, but . . . you will tell them, won ’ t you? The Old Bear, at least? You ’ ll tell him that I never broke my oath . [EOS] Qhorin Halfhand gazed at him across the fire, his eyes lost in pools of shadow . When I see him next . I swear it . He gestured at the fire . More wood . I want it bright and hot.Jon went to cut more branches, snapping each one in two before tossing it into the flames . The tree had been dead a long time, but it seemed to live again in the fire, as fiery dancers woke within each stick of wood to whirl and spin in their glowing gowns of yellow, red, and orange.Enough, Qhorin said abruptly . Now we ride.Ride? It was dark beyond the fire, and the night was cold . Ride where?Back . Qhorin mounted his weary garron one more time . The fire will draw them past, I hope . Come, brother.Jon pulled on his gloves again and raised his hood . Even the horses seemed reluctant to leave the fire . The sun was long gone, and only the cold silver shine of the half-moon remained to light their way over the treacherous ground that lay behind them . He did not know what Qhorin had in mind, but perhaps it was a chance . He hoped so . I do not want to play the oathbreaker, even for good reason.They went cautiously, moving as silent as man and horse could move, retracing their steps until they reached the mouth of a narrow defile where an icy little stream emerged from between two mountains . Jon remembered the place . They had watered the horses here before the sun went down.The water ’ s icing up, Qhorin observed as he turned aside, else we ’ d ride in the streambed . But if we break the ice, they are like to see . Keep close to the cliffs . There ’ s a crook a half mile on that will hide us . He rode into the defile . Jon gave one last wistful look to their distant fire, and followed.The farther in they went, the closer the cliffs pressed to either side . They followed the moonlit ribbon of stream back toward its source . Icicles bearded its stony banks, but Jon could still hear the sound of rushing water beneath the thin hard crust.A great jumble of fallen rock blocked their way partway up, where a section of the cliff face had fallen, but the surefooted little garrons were able to pick their way through . Beyond, the walls pinched in sharply, and the stream led them to the foot of a tall twisting waterfall . The air was full of mist, like the breath of some vast cold beast . The tumbling waters shone silver in the moonlight . Jon looked about in dismay . There is no way out . He and Qhorin might be able to climb the cliffs, but not with the horses . He did not think they would last long afoot.Quickly now, the Halfhand commanded . The big man on the small horse rode over the ice-slick stones, right into the curtain of water, and vanished . When he did not reappear, Jon put his heels into his horse and went after . His garron did his best to shy away . The falling water slapped at them with frozen fists, and the shock of the cold seemed to stop Jon ’ s breath.Then he was through; drenched and shivering, but through.The cleft in the rock was barely large enough for man and horse to pass, but beyond, the walls opened up and the floor turned to soft sand . Jon could feel the spray freezing in his beard . Ghost burst through the waterfall in an angry rush, shook droplets from his fur, sniffed at the darkness suspiciously, then lifted a leg against one rocky wall . Qhorin had already dismounted . Jon did the same . You knew this place was here.When I was no older than you, I heard a brother tell how he followed a shadowcat through these falls . He unsaddled his horse, removed her bit and bridle, and ran his fingers through her shaggy mane . There is a way through the heart of the mountain . Come dawn, if they have not found us, we will press on . The first watch is mine, brother . Qhorin seated himself on the sand, his back to a wall, no more than a vague black shadow in the gloom of the cave . Over the rush of falling waters, Jon heard a soft sound of steel on leather that could only mean that the Halfhand had drawn his sword.He took off his wet cloak, but it was too cold and damp here to strip down any further . Ghost stretched out beside him and licked his glove before curling up to sleep . Jon was grateful for his warmth . He wondered if the fire was still burning outside, or if it had gone out by now . If the Wall should ever fall, all the fires will go out . The moon shone through the curtain of falling water to lay a shimmering pale stripe across the sand, but after a time that too faded and went dark.Sleep came at last, and with it nightmares . He dreamed of burning castles and dead men rising unquiet from their graves . It was still dark when Qhorin woke him . While the Halfhand slept, Jon sat with his back to the cave wall, listening to the water and waiting for the dawn.At break of day, they each chewed a half-frozen strip of horsemeat, then saddled their garrons once again, and fastened their black cloaks around their shoulders . During his watch the Halfhand had made a half-dozen torches, soaking bundles of dry moss with the oil he carried in his saddlebag . He lit the first one now and led the way down into the dark, holding the pale flame up before him . Jon followed with the horses . The stony path twisted and turned, first down, then up, then down more steeply . In spots it grew so narrow it was hard to convince the garrons they could squeeze through . By the time we come out we will have lost them, he told himself as they went . Not even an eagle can see through solid stone . We will have lost them, and we will ride hard for the Fist, and tell the Old Bear all we know.But when they emerged back into the light long hours later, the eagle was waiting for them, perched on a dead tree a hundred feet up the slope . Ghost went bounding up the rocks after it, but the bird flapped its wings and took to the air.Qhorin ’ s mouth tightened as he followed its flight with his eyes . Here is as good a place as any to make a stand, he declared . The mouth of the cave shelters us from above, and they cannot get behind us without passing through the mountain . Is your sword sharp, Jon Snow?Yes, he said.We ’ ll feed the horses . They ’ ve served us bravely, poor beasts.Jon gave his garron the last of the oats and stroked his shaggy mane while Ghost prowled restlessly amongst the rocks . He pulled his gloves on tighter and flexed his burnt fingers . I am the shield that guards the realms of men.A hunting horn echoed through the mountains, and a moment later Jon heard the baying of hounds . They will be with us soon, announced Qhorin . Keep your wolf in hand.Jon called . The direwolf returned reluctantly to his side, tail held stiffly behind him . [BOS] Ghost, to me, [EOS] The wildlings came boiling over a ridge not half a mile away . Their hounds ran before them, snarling grey-brown beasts with more than a little wolf in their blood . Ghost bared his teeth, his fur bristling . Jon murmured . [BOS] Easy, Stay . [EOS] Overhead he heard a rustle of wings . The eagle landed on an outcrop of rock and screamed in triumph.The hunters approached warily, perhaps fearing arrows . Jon counted fourteen, with eight dogs . Their large round shields were made of skins stretched over woven wicker and painted with skulls . About half of them hid their faces behind crude helms of wood and boiled leather . On either wing, archers notched shafts to the strings of small wood-and-horn bows, but did not loose . The rest seemed to be armed with spears and mauls . One had a chipped stone axe . They wore only what bits of armor they had looted from dead rangers or stolen during raids . Wildlings did not mine or smelt, and there were few smiths and fewer forges north of the Wall.Qhorin drew his longsword . The tale of how he had taught himself to fight with his left hand after losing half of his right was part of his legend; it was said that he handled a blade better now than he ever had before . Jon stood shoulder to shoulder with the big ranger and pulled Longclaw from its sheath . Despite the chill in the air, sweat stung his eyes.Ten yards below the cave mouth the hunters halted . Their leader came on alone, riding a beast that seemed more goat than horse, from the surefooted way it climbed the uneven slope . As man and mount grew nearer Jon could hear them clattering; both were armored in bones . Cow bones, sheep bones, the bones of goats and aurochs and elk, the great bones of the hairy mammoths . . . and human bones as well.Rattleshirt, Qhorin called down, icy-polite.To crows I be the Lord o ’ Bones . The rider ’ s helm was made from the broken skull of a giant, and all up and down his arms bearclaws had been sewn to his boiled leather.Qhorin snorted . I see no lord . Only a dog dressed in chickenbones, who rattles when he rides.The wildling hissed in anger, and his mount reared . He did rattle, Jon could hear it; the bones were strung together loosely, so they clacked and clattered when he moved . It ’ s your bones I ’ ll be rattling soon, Halfhand . I ’ ll boil the flesh off you and make a byrnie from your ribs . I ’ ll carve your teeth to cast me runes, and eat me oaten porridge from your skull.If you want my bones, come get them.That, Rattleshirt seemed reluctant to do . His numbers meant little in the close confines of the rocks where the black brothers had taken their stand; to winkle them out of the cave the wildlings would need to come up two at a time . But another of his company edged a horse up beside him, one of the fighting women called spearwives . We are four-and-ten to two, crows, and eight dogs to your wolf, she called . Fight or run, you are ours.Show them, commanded Rattleshirt.The woman reached into a bloodstained sack and drew out a trophy . Ebben had been bald as an egg, so she dangled the head by an ear . He died brave, she said.But he died, said Rattleshirt, same like you . He freed his battle-axe, brandishing it above his head . Good steel it was, with a wicked gleam to both blades; Ebben was never a man to neglect his weapons . The other wildlings crowded forward beside him, yelling taunts . A few chose Jon for their mockery . Is that your wolf, boy? a skinny youth called, unlimbering a stone flail . He ’ ll be my cloak before the sun is down . On the other side of the line, another spearwife opened her ragged furs to show Jon a heavy white breast . Does the baby want his momma? Come, have a suck o ’ this, boy . The dogs were barking too.They would shame us into folly . Qhorin gave Jon a long look . Remember your orders.Belike we need to flush the crows, Rattleshirt bellowed over the clamor . Feather them!No! The word burst from Jon ’ s lips before the bowmen could loose . He took two quick steps forward . We yield!They warned me bastard blood was craven, he heard Qhorin Halfhand say coldly behind him . I see it is so . Run to your new masters, coward.Face reddening, Jon descended the slope to where Rattleshirt sat his horse . The wildling stared at him through the eyeholes of his helm, and said, The free folk have no need of cravens.He is no craven . One of the archers pulled off her sewn sheepskin helm and shook out a head of shaggy red hair . This is the Bastard o ’ Winterfell, who spared me . Let him live.Jon met Ygritte ’ s eyes, and had no words.Let him die, insisted the Lord of Bones . The black crow is a tricksy bird . I trust him not.On a rock above them, the eagle flapped its wings and split the air with a scream of fury.The bird hates you, Jon Snow, said Ygritte . And well he might . He was a man, before you killed him.I did not know, said Jon truthfully, trying to remember the face of the man he had slain in the pass . You told me Mance would take me.And he will, Ygritte said.Mance is not here, said Rattleshirt . Ragwyle, gut him.The big spearwife narrowed her eyes and said, If the crow would join the free folk, let him show us his prowess and prove the truth of him.I ’ ll do whatever you ask . The words came hard, but Jon said them.Rattleshirt ’ s bone armor clattered loudly as he laughed . Then kill the Halfhand, bastard.As if he could, said Qhorin . Turn, Snow, and die.And then Qhorin ’ s sword was coming at him and somehow Longclaw leapt upward to block . The force of impact almost knocked the bastard blade from Jon ’ s hand, and sent him staggering backward . You must not balk, whatever is asked of you . He shifted to a two-hand grip, quick enough to deliver a stroke of his own, but the big ranger brushed it aside with contemptuous ease . Back and forth they went, black cloaks swirling, the youth ’ s quickness against the savage strength of Qhorin ’ s left-hand cuts . The Halfhand ’ s longsword seemed to be everywhere at once, raining down from one side and then the other, driving him where he would, keeping him off balance . Already he could feel his arms growing numb.Even when Ghost ’ s teeth closed savagely around the ranger ’ s calf, somehow Qhorin kept his feet . But in that instant, as he twisted, the opening was there . Jon planted and pivoted . The ranger was leaning away, and for an instant it seemed that Jon ’ s slash had not touched him . Then a string of red tears appeared across the big man ’ s throat, bright as a ruby necklace, and the blood gushed out of him, and Qhorin Halfhand fell.Ghost ’ s muzzle was dripping red, but only the point of the bastard blade was stained, the last half inch . Jon pulled the direwolf away and knelt with one arm around him . The light was already fading in Qhorin ’ s eyes . . . . sharp, he said, lifting his maimed fingers . Then his hand fell, and he was gone.He knew, he thought numbly . He knew what they would ask of me . He thought of Samwell Tarly then, of Grenn and Dolorous Edd, of Pyp and Toad back at Castle Black . Had he lost them all, as he had lost Bran and Rickon and Robb? Who was he now? What was he?Get him up . Rough hands dragged him to his feet . Jon did not resist . Do you have a name?Ygritte answered for him . His name is Jon Snow . He is Eddard Stark ’ s blood, of Winterfell.Ragwyle laughed . Who would have thought it? Qhorin Halfhand slain by some lordling ’ s byblow.Gut him . That was Rattleshirt, still ahorse . The eagle flew to him and perched atop his bony helm, screeching.He yielded, Ygritte reminded them.Aye, and slew his brother, said a short homely man in a rust-eaten iron halfhelm.Rattleshirt rode closer, bones clattering . The wolf did his work for him . It were foully done . The Halfhand ’ s death was mine.We all saw how eager you were to take it, mocked Ragwyle.He is a warg, said the Lord of Bones, and a crow . I like him not.A warg he may be, Ygritte said, but that has never frightened us . Others shouted agreement . Behind the eyeholes of his yellowed skull Rattleshirt ’ s stare was malignant, but he yielded grudgingly . These are a free folk indeed, thought Jon.They burned Qhorin Halfhand where he ’ d fallen, on a pyre made of pine needles, brush, and broken branches . Some of the wood was still green, and it burned slow and smoky, sending a black plume up into the bright hard blue of the sky . Afterward Rattleshirt claimed some charred bones, while the others threw dice for the ranger ’ s gear . Ygritte won his cloak.Jon asked her . He did not know if he could face those heights again, or if his garron could survive a second crossing . [BOS] Will we return by the Skirling Pass? [EOS] No, she said . There ’ s nothing behind us . The look she gave him was sad . By now Mance is well down the Milkwater, marching on your Wall.
