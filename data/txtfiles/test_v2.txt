Ghost leapt . Man and wolf went down together with neither scream nor snarl, rolling, smashing into a chair, knocking over a table laden with papers . Mormont ’ s raven was flapping overhead, screaming, Jon felt as blind as Maester Aemon . Keeping the wall to his back, he slid toward the window and ripped down the curtain . Moonlight flooded the solar . He glimpsed black hands buried in white fur, swollen dark fingers tightening around his direwolf ’ s throat . Ghost was twisting and snapping, legs flailing in the air, but he could not break free . [BOS] Corn, corn, corn, corn . [EOS] Jon lied … loudly, as if that could make it true . [BOS] I am, my lord, And you? [EOS] Jon flexed his bandaged fingers to show him . He had burned himself more badly than he knew throwing the flaming drapes, and his right hand was swathed in silk halfway to the elbow . At the time he ’ d felt nothing; the agony had come after . His cracked red skin oozed fluid, and fearsome blood blisters rose between his fingers, big as roaches . [BOS] Healing . The maester says I ’ ll have scars, but otherwise the hand should be as good as it was before . [EOS] Jon replied . [BOS] Soon, [EOS] Jon nodded . [BOS] Does it have a name, my lord? [EOS] Jon tried a practice cut . He was clumsy and uncomfortable with his left hand, yet even so the steel seemed to flow through the air, as if it had a will of its own . [BOS] Longclaw is an apt name . Wolves have claws, as much as bears . [EOS] Jon said . [BOS] At what? [EOS] Jon raked them with an accusing look . [BOS] You knew . [EOS] Jon shifted the bucket to his right hand and thrust his left down into the bloody bits . The ravens began to scream noisily and fly at the bars, beating at the metal with night-black wings . The meat had been chopped into pieces no larger than a finger joint . He filled his fist and tossed the raw red morsels into the cage, and the squawking and squabbling grew hotter . Feathers flew as two of the larger birds fought over a choice piece . Quickly Jon grabbed a second handful and threw it in after the first . [BOS] Lord Mormont ’ s raven likes fruit and corn . [EOS] Jon said bitterly . [BOS] You don ’ t know, No one knows . Even if I am his bastard, he ’ s still my father … [EOS] Jon told him . [BOS] I would sooner not hurt you, Move aside, Sam, or I ’ ll ride you down . [EOS] Jon told the direwolf as he swung up into the saddle . He turned the mare ’ s head to slide off through the trees, but they were on him before he had gone ten feet . [BOS] Traitor, [EOS] Jon wheeled around to face them, drawing his sword . [BOS] Get back . I don ’ t wish to hurt you, but I will if I have to . [EOS] Jon demanded . [BOS] What do you want with me? [EOS] Jon told them . [BOS] So did I, Don ’ t you understand? They murdered my father . It ’ s war, my brother Robb is fighting in the riverlands— [EOS] Jon said fervently . [BOS] I have to, [EOS] Jon cursed them all to their faces . They took no notice . Pyp spurred his horse closer, reciting, [BOS] I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men . [EOS] Jon said, dismounting . [BOS] I ’ m not, [EOS] Jon said sullenly . He did not care to talk of his father ’ s death, not even to Mormont . [BOS] I remember, [EOS] Jon ’ s throat was dry . [BOS] You know? [EOS] Jon said . [BOS] My friends brought me back, [EOS] Jon felt like a fool . [BOS] No . [EOS] Jon stood tall . He told himself that he would die well; that much he could do, at the least . [BOS] I know the penalty for desertion, my lord . I ’ m not afraid to die . [EOS] Jon said . There had been others . Too many . [BOS] No, [EOS] Jon Snow straightened himself and took a long deep breath . Forgive me, Father . Robb, Arya, Bran … forgive me, I cannot help you . He has the truth of it . This is my place . [BOS] I am … yours, my lord . Your man . I swear it . I will not run again . [EOS]
