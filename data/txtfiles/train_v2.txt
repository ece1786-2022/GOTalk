Jon said . [BOS] He ’ s not like the others, He never makes a sound . That ’ s why I named him Ghost . That, and because he ’ s white . The others are all dark, grey or black . [EOS] Jon answered in a flat voice . [BOS] Most times, But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them . [EOS] Jon had noticed that too . A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the truth that people hid behind their eyes . His father was observing all the courtesies, but there was tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before . He said little, looking out over the hall with hooded eyes, seeing nothing . Two seats away, the king had been drinking heavily all night . His broad face was flushed behind his great black beard . He made many a toast, laughed loudly at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside him the queen seemed as cold as an ice sculpture . Jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice . [BOS] The queen is angry too, Father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon . The queen didn ’ t want him to go . [EOS] Jon swelled with pride . [BOS] Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but I ’ m the better sword, and Hullen says I sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle . [EOS] Jon said in a sudden rush . [BOS] Take me with you when you go back to the Wall, Father will give me leave to go if you ask him, I know he will . [EOS] Jon protested . [BOS] I am almost a man grown, I will turn fifteen on my next name day, and Maester Luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children . [EOS] Jon said . The Young Dragon was one of his heroes . [BOS] Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne, [EOS] Jon boasted . The wine was making him bold . He tried to sit very straight, to make himself seem taller . [BOS] I forget nothing, I want to serve in the Night ’ s Watch, Uncle . [EOS] Jon said . [BOS] A bastard can have honor too, I am ready to swear your oath . [EOS] Jon said hotly . [BOS] I don ’ t care about that! [EOS] Jon felt anger rise inside him . [BOS] I ’ m not your son! [EOS] Jon hesitated, then nodded slowly . [BOS] Can you climb down, or shall I bring a ladder? [EOS] Jon said . He knelt and called out . [BOS] He ’ s not scared, Ghost, come here . Come on . That ’ s it . [EOS] Jon said . It wasn ’ t actually true yet, but it would be . [BOS] If I wasn ’ t here, he ’ d tear out your throat, [EOS] Jon said . He rose . Standing, he was taller than the dwarf . It made him feel strange . [BOS] I know, [EOS] Jon admitted stiffly . [BOS] Lord Eddard Stark is my father, [EOS] Jon corrected . He was pleased by the dwarf ’ s comment, but he tried not to let it show . [BOS] Half brothers, [EOS] Jon was in no mood for anyone ’ s counsel . [BOS] What do you know about being a bastard? [EOS] Jon said . [BOS] I don ’ t even know who my mother was, [EOS] Jon said . [BOS] I came to see Bran, To say good-bye . [EOS] Jon agreed . His voice was flat and tired . The visit had taken all the strength from him . [BOS] You Starks are hard to kill, [EOS] Jon told him . [BOS] She was … very kind, [EOS] Jon forced himself to smile back . [BOS] It was always my color . How long do you think it will be? [EOS] Jon hugged him back . [BOS] And you, Stark . Take care of Bran . [EOS] Jon told him . [BOS] I have one more farewell to make, [EOS] Jon told her . [BOS] So are you, I had Mikken make this special . The bravos use swords like this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities . It won ’ t hack a man ’ s head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you ’ re fast enough . [EOS] Jon said . [BOS] First lesson, Stick them with the pointy end . [EOS] Jon said . [BOS] Not if she doesn ’ t know you have it, [EOS] Jon promised her . [BOS] You ’ ll find someone, King ’ s Landing is a true city, a thousand times the size of Winterfell . Until you find a partner, watch how they fight in the yard . Run, and ride, make yourself strong . And whatever you do … [EOS] Jon messed up her hair . [BOS] I will miss you, little sister . [EOS] Arya ran to him for a last hug . Jon warned her, laughing . She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses . [BOS] Put down the sword first, [EOS] Jon teased . [BOS] Can ’ t you guess? Your very favorite thing . [EOS] Jon admitted . His arm burned from the weight of the longsword, and he was starting to feel his bruises now that the fight was done . [BOS] I ’ m tired, [EOS] Jon rose at dawn the next day to watch his uncle leave . One of his rangers, a big ugly man, sang a bawdy song as he saddled his garron, his breath steaming in the cold morning air . Ben Stark smiled at that, but he had no smile for his nephew . [BOS] How often must I tell you no, Jon? We ’ ll speak when I return . [EOS] Jon reached back for his sword, but one of them grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back . [BOS] Try . [EOS] Jon told him . The boy who had his arm jerked upward on him, hard . Pain lanced through him, but Jon would not cry out . [BOS] You looked bad before I ever met you, [EOS] Jon ’ s anger flared . [BOS] He said my mother was— [EOS] Jon said icily . [BOS] Lord Eddard Stark was not a man to sleep with whores, His honor— [EOS] Jon was cold with rage . [BOS] Can I go? [EOS] Jon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier, until Noye took him under the chin, thick fingers twisting his head around . [BOS] Look at me when I ’ m talking to you, boy . [EOS] Jon looked . The armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match . His nose was flat and broad, and he always seemed in need of a shave . The left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword . [BOS] Words won ’ t make your mother a whore . She was what she was, and nothing Toad says can change that . You know, we have men on the Wall whose mothers were whores . [EOS] Jon said . [BOS] I don ’ t care, I don ’ t care about them and I don ’ t care about you or Thorne or Benjen Stark or any of it . I hate it here . It ’ s too … it ’ s cold . [EOS] Jon repeated bitterly . The armorer could talk about life . He ’ d had one . He ’ d only taken the black after he ’ d lost an arm at the siege of Storm ’ s End . Before that he ’ d smithed for Stannis Baratheon, the king ’ s brother . He ’ d seen the Seven Kingdoms from one end to the other; he ’ d feasted and wenched and fought in a hundred battles . They said it was Donal Noye who ’ d forged King Robert ’ s warhammer, the one that crushed the life from Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident . He ’ d done all the things that Jon would never do, and then when he was old, well past thirty, he ’ d taken a glancing blow from an axe and the wound had festered until the whole arm had to come off . Only then, crippled, had Donal Noye come to the Wall, when his life was all but over . [BOS] Life, [EOS] Jon snapped . [BOS] They ’ re not my brothers, They hate me because I ’ m better than they are . [EOS] Jon said warily . There was a trap here . He felt it closing around him . [BOS] Ser Rodrik Cassel, [EOS] Jon said sharply, but the force had gone out of his anger . Suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty . [BOS] Don ’ t call me that! I never … I didn ’ t think … [EOS] Jon looked around . [BOS] Lannister . I didn ’ t see—I mean, I thought I was alone . [EOS] Jon told him . He had seen little of the dwarf since their journey ended . As the queen ’ s own brother, Tyrion Lannister had been an honored guest of the Night ’ s Watch . The Lord Commander had given him rooms in the King ’ s Tower—so-called, though no king had visited it for a hundred years—and Lannister dined at Mormont ’ s own table and spent his days riding the Wall and his nights dicing and drinking with Ser Alliser and Bowen Marsh and the other high officers . [BOS] You won ’ t learn anything from me, [EOS] Jon said . He wanted to ride with Benjen Stark on his rangings, deep into the mysteries of the haunted forest, wanted to fight Mance Rayder ’ s wildlings and ward the realm against the Others, but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted . [BOS] It ’ s nothing special, The rangers say it ’ s just woods and mountains and frozen lakes, with lots of snow and ice . [EOS] Jon said stubbornly . [BOS] It ’ s better that I ’ m by myself, The rest of them are scared of Ghost . [EOS] Jon pulled off his gloves and warmed his hands in the steam rising from the bowl . The smell made his mouth water . [BOS] It ’ s mutton stew . [EOS] Jon breathed, scrambling to his feet . [BOS] Bran, Something ’ s happened to Bran . [EOS] Jon smiled at him . [BOS] I ’ m sorry about your wrist . Robb used the same move on me once, only with a wooden blade . It hurt like seven hells, but yours must be worse . Look, if you want, I can show you how to defend that . [EOS] Jon said . [BOS] I ’ ll take that wager, Ser Alliser, I ’ d love to see Ghost juggle . [EOS] Jon shook off Pyp ’ s hand . [BOS] Halder, enough . [EOS] Jon said to the fat boy . Ser Alliser had often sent two foes against him, but never three . He knew he would likely go to sleep bruised and bloody tonight . He braced himself for the assault . [BOS] Stay behind me, [EOS] Jon replied . Under his mail and leather, his shoulder was throbbing . He sheathed his sword and tried to remove his helm, but when he raised his arm, the pain made him grit his teeth . [BOS] For an instant, you did, [EOS] Jon said . [BOS] These two are Grenn and Pypar, [EOS] Jon said . [BOS] A direwolf, His name is Ghost . The direwolf is the sigil of my father ’ s House . [EOS] Jon asked him . [BOS] What ’ s wrong now? Why are you always so frightened? [EOS] Jon said . [BOS] Talk, Have you seen the Wall? [EOS] Jon said, pointing . [BOS] There ’ s a winch, They can draw you up in a cage . [EOS] Jon shrugged . [BOS] There ’ s hot cider to drink, or mulled wine if you prefer . Some nights Dareon sings for us, if the mood is on him . He was a singer, before … well, not truly, but almost, an apprentice singer . [EOS] Jon snapped angrily . [BOS] Stop it! [EOS] The other boys fell silent, taken aback by his sudden fury . Jon said into the quiet, and he told them how it was going to be . Pyp backed him, as he ’ d known he would, but when Halder spoke up, it was a pleasant surprise . Grenn was anxious at the first, but Jon knew the words to move him . One by one the rest fell in line . Jon persuaded some, cajoled some, shamed the others, made threats where threats were required . At the end they had all agreed … all but Rast . [BOS] Listen to me, [EOS] Hours later, as the castle slept, three of them paid a call on his cell . Grenn held his arms while Pyp sat on his legs . Jon could hear Rast ’ s rapid breathing as Ghost leapt onto his chest . The direwolf ’ s eyes burned red as embers as his teeth nipped lightly at the soft skin of the boy ’ s throat, just enough to draw blood . Jon said softly . [BOS] Remember, we know where you sleep, [EOS] Jon said . He put a hand on Sam ’ s broad shoulder . [BOS] We ’ re not friends, We ’ re brothers . [EOS] Jon said . [BOS] All we could wasn ’ t enough, [EOS] It was Chett who answered Jon ’ s knock . Jon told him . [BOS] I need to speak to Maester Aemon, [EOS] Jon jammed it open with his boot . [BOS] I need to speak to him now . The morning will be too late . [EOS] Jon said . [BOS] Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you, Give him my pardons . I would not disturb his rest if it were not important . [EOS] Jon had his boot wedged solidly in the door . [BOS] I can stand here all night if I must . [EOS] Jon told him . [BOS] The Lord Commander listens to you, And the wounded and the sick of the Night ’ s Watch are in your charge . [EOS] Jon promised, [BOS] He will be, unless you help . [EOS] He told them all of it, even the part where he ’ d set Ghost at Rast ’ s throat . Maester Aemon listened silently, blind eyes fixed on the fire, but Chett ’ s face darkened with each word . Jon finished . [BOS] Without us to keep him safe, Sam will have no chance, He ’ s hopeless with a sword . My sister Arya could tear him apart, and she ’ s not yet ten . If Ser Alliser makes him fight, it ’ s only a matter of time before he ’ s hurt or killed . [EOS] Jon said . He took a deep breath to gather his thoughts . [BOS] That ’ s stupid, I remember once I asked Maester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat . [EOS] Jon said, remembering . [BOS] He told me that a maester ’ s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve, I asked why each link was a different metal . A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes, I said . Maester Luwin laughed . A maester forges his chain with study, he told me . The different metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for healing, iron for warcraft . And he said there were other meanings as well . The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves, isn ’ t that so? Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links can ’ t make a chain . You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like . A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people . [EOS] Jon said, smiling . [BOS] You ’ ll do well at that, [EOS] Jon stood . [BOS] I do, my lord . [EOS] Jon said . The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him; the blood of the First Men flowed in the veins of the Starks . [BOS] Yes, my lord, [EOS] Jon asked sharply . [BOS] And what will my duties be? Will I serve the Lord Commander ’ s meals, help him fasten his clothes, fetch hot water for his bath? [EOS] Jon turned on him in a fury . [BOS] I see Ser Alliser ’ s bloody hand, that ’ s all I see . He wanted to shame me, and he has . [EOS] Jon blazed back . [BOS] I ’ m a better swordsman and a better rider than any of you, It ’ s not fair . [EOS] Jon let out a deep sigh . [BOS] You have the right of it . I was acting the boy . [EOS] Jon climbed into his saddle . When Bowen Marsh and their ranger escort had mounted, Jon put two fingers in his mouth and whistled . Ghost came loping out of the tunnel . [BOS] They never have . [EOS] Jon said . Ghost ’ s head lifted . He seemed to taste the air . In the blink of an eye he was off, racing across the broad, weed-choked field to vanish in the trees . [BOS] Yes, my lord, [EOS] Jon told him, keeping his voice low so the others would not hear . [BOS] You have to look, Maester Aemon sent you to be his eyes, didn ’ t he? What good are eyes if they ’ re shut? [EOS] Jon put a hand on Sam ’ s shoulder . [BOS] We have a dozen rangers with us, and the dogs, even Ghost . No one will hurt you, Sam . Go ahead and look . The first look is the hardest . [EOS] Jon blurted . [BOS] Let him speak, ser, [EOS] Jon saw at once what Sam meant . He could see the torn veins in the dead man ’ s wrist, iron worms in the pale flesh . His blood was a black dust . Yet Jaremy Rykker was unconvinced . [BOS] If they ’ d been dead much longer than a day, they ’ d be ripe by now, boy . They don ’ t even smell . [EOS] Jon said softly . [BOS] Untouched, And Ghost is different . The dogs and the horses won ’ t go near them . [EOS] Jon was stunned . Robert Baratheon had looked old and fat when he visited Winterfell, yet he ’ d seemed hale enough, and there ’ d been no talk of illness . [BOS] How can you know? [EOS] Jon wondered if Joffrey would keep his father as the King ’ s Hand . It did not seem likely . That might mean Lord Eddard would return to Winterfell, and his sisters as well . He might even be allowed to visit them, with Lord Mormont ’ s permission . It would be good to see Arya ’ s grin again and to talk with his father . I will ask him about my mother, he resolved . I am a man now, it is past time he told me . Even if she was a whore, I don ’ t care, I want to know . [BOS] They were as close as brothers, once . [EOS] Jon replied . [BOS] Yes, Two of the six he took with him . They ’ d been dead a long time, only … the bodies are queer . [EOS] Jon remained standing . [BOS] It ’ s my father, isn ’ t it? [EOS] Jon could scarcely follow what he was saying . [BOS] My lord, I don ’ t understand . What ’ s happened to my father? [EOS] Jon said at once . [BOS] No, That couldn ’ t be . My father would never betray the king! [EOS] Jon insisted . How could they think his father was a traitor, had they all gone mad? Lord Eddard Stark would never dishonor himself … would he? [BOS] But it ’ s a lie, [EOS] Jon reminded him sharply . Tyrion Lannister had been a friend to him . If Lord Eddard was killed, she would be as much to blame as the queen . [BOS] Lady Stark is not my mother, My lord, what of my sisters? Arya and Sansa, they were with my father, do you know— [EOS]
