      "Something rubbed against his leg beneath the table . Jon saw red eyes staring up at him . “ Hungry again? ” he asked . There was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table . Jon reached out to tear off a leg, then had a better idea . He knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his legs . Ghost ripped into it in savage silence . His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their wolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count at this end of the hall, and no one had said a word about his pup . He told himself he was fortunate in that too.\n",

His feet got tangled under him as he tried to leave, and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor . Laughter boomed all around him, and Jon felt hot tears on his cheeks . Someone tried to steady him . He wrenched free of their grip and ran, half-blind, for the door . Ghost followed close at his heels, out into the night.\n",
