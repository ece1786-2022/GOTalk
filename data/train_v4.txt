No . Jon had not thought of it that way.They all fell silent, listening . Jon found himself holding his breath . Sam, he thought . He hadn ’ t gone to the Old Bear, but he hadn ’ t gone to bed either, he ’ d woken the other boys . Damn them all . Come dawn, if they were not in their beds, they ’ d be named deserters too . What did they think they were doing?I would not . Grenn sounded peeved . I ’ d just ride south, you can tell south by the stars.You ’ re too stupid to be craven, Pyp told him.None of us are here for asking, Sam reminded him.Ser Endrew Tarth, a good man . He ’ s on his way from the Shadow Tower to assume the duties of master-at-arms . Ser Alliser Thorne left yestermorn for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.Jon hesitated . He wanted to say that Lord Eddard would never dishonor himself, not even for love, yet inside a small sly voice whispered, He fathered a bastard, where was the honor in that? And your mother, what of his duty to her, he will not even say her name . He would do whatever was right, he said … ringingly, to make up for his hesitation . No matter what.The Old Bear sighed . You are not the only one touched by this war . Like as not, my sister is marching in your brother ’ s host, her and those daughters of hers, dressed in men ’ s mail . Maege is a hoary old snark, stubborn, short-tempered, and willful . Truth be told, I can hardly stand to be around the wretched woman, but that does not mean my love for her is any less than the love you bear your half sisters . Frowning, Mormont took his last egg and squeezed it in his fist until the shell crunched . Or perhaps it does . Be that as it may, I ’ d still grieve if she were slain, yet you don ’ t see me running off . I said the words, just as you did . My place is here … where is yours, boy?Yet he must have dozed . When he woke, his legs were stiff and cramped and the candle had long since burned out . Ghost stood on his hind legs, scrabbling at the door . Jon was startled to see how tall he ’ d grown . Ghost, what is it? he called softly . The direwolf turned his head and looked down at him, baring his fangs in a silent snarl . Has he gone mad? Jon wondered . It ’ s me, Ghost, he murmured, trying not to sound afraid . Yet he was trembling, violently . When had it gotten so cold?Suddenly Pyp was beside him . Three to two will make for better sport, the small boy said cheerfully . He dropped his visor and slid out his sword . Before Jon could even think to protest, Grenn had stepped up to make a third.Jon admitted stiffly . [BOS] Lord Eddard Stark is my father, [EOS] No one had told him the Night ’ s Watch would be like this; no one except Tyrion Lannister . The dwarf had given him the truth on the road north, but by then it had been too late . Jon wondered if his father had known what the Wall would be like . He must have, he thought; that only made it hurt the worse.I did not ask for your views, boy, Rykker said coldly.Once that would have sent him running . Once that might even have made him cry . Now it only made him angry . He would be a Sworn Brother of the Night ’ s Watch soon, and face worse dangers than Catelyn Tully Stark . He ’ s my brother, he said.Jon pulled himself to his feet . Donal Noye stood glowering at them . The yard is for fighting, the armorer said . Keep your quarrels out of my armory, or I ’ ll make them my quarrels . You won ’ t like that.He remembered Robb as he had last seen him, standing in the yard with snow melting in his auburn hair . Jon would have to come to him in secret, disguised . He tried to imagine the look on Robb ’ s face when he revealed himself . His brother would shake his head and smile, and he ’ d say … he ’ d say …Jon hated that name, a mockery that Ser Alliser had hung on him the first day he came to practice . The boys had picked it up, and now he heard it everywhere . He slid the longsword back into its scabbard . [BOS] No, [EOS] he replied.The Lord of Ham thinks he ’ s too good to eat with the likes of us, suggested Jeren.Do you like to hunt?A toothless smile quivered on the ancient lips . Only a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night ’ s Watch . In my order, we put aside our house names when we take our vows and don the collar . The old man touched the maester ’ s chain that hung loosely around his thin, fleshless neck . My father was Maekar, the First of his Name, and my brother Aegon reigned after him in my stead . My grandfather named me for Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, who was his uncle, or his father, depending on which tale you believe . Aemon, he called me …That will be all, Thorne told them . I can only stomach so much ineptitude in any one day . If the Others ever come for us, I pray they have archers, because you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder.Spare me your but ’ s, boy, Lord Mormont interrupted . I would not be sitting here were it not for you and that beast of yours . You fought bravely … and more to the point, you thought quickly . Fire! Yes, damn it . We ought to have known . We ought to have remembered . The Long Night has come before . Oh, eight thousand years is a good while, to be sure … yet if the Night ’ s Watch does not remember, who will?Later, much later, after they had marched him back to his sleeping cell, Mormont came down to see him, raven on his shoulder . I told you not to do anything stupid, boy, the Old Bear said . Boy, the bird chorused . Mormont shook his head, disgusted . And to think I had high hopes for you.Dead Othor slammed into him, knocking him off his feet.He was at the door when she called out to him . Jon, she said . He should have kept going, but she had never called him by his name before . He turned to find her looking at his face, as if she were seeing it for the first time.Mormont stood before the altar, the rainbow shining on his broad bald head . You came to us outlaws, he began, poachers, rapers, debtors, killers, and thieves . You came to us children . You came to us alone, in chains, with neither friends nor honor . You came to us rich, and you came to us poor . Some of you bear the names of proud houses . Others have only bastards ’ names, or no names at all . It makes no matter . All that is past now . On the Wall, we are all one house.Sam mopped at the sweat on his brow . You … you can see where Ghost … Jon ’ s direwolf … you can see where he tore off that man ’ s hand, and yet … the stump hasn ’ t bled, look … He waved a hand . My father … L-lord Randyll, he, he made me watch him dress animals sometimes, when … after … Sam shook his head from side to side, his chins quivering . Now that he had looked at the bodies, he could not seem to look away . A fresh kill … the blood would still flow, my lords . Later … later it would be clotted, like a … a jelly, thick and … and … He looked as though he was going to be sick . This man … look at the wrist, it ’ s all … crusty … dry … like …Jon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur . The direwolf looked up at him, nipped gently at his hand, then went back to eating.Yes? he said.He would need to find new clothes soon; most like, he ’ d need to steal them . He was clad in black from head to heel; high leather riding boots, roughspun breeches and tunic, sleeveless leather jerkin, and heavy wool cloak . His longsword and dagger were sheathed in black moleskin, and the hauberk and coif in his saddlebag were black ringmail . Any bit of it could mean his death if he were taken . A stranger wearing black was viewed with cold suspicion in every village and holdfast north of the Neck, and men would soon be watching for him . Once Maester Aemon ’ s ravens took flight, Jon knew he would find no safe haven . Not even at Winterfell . Bran might want to let him in, but Maester Luwin had better sense . He would bar the gates and send Jon away, as he should . Better not to call there at all.Maester Aemon closed his eyes, and for a brief moment Jon was afraid that he had gone to sleep . Finally he said, Maester Luwin taught you well, Jon Snow . Your mind is as deft as your blade, it would seem.I heard Hake say the dead men were your uncle ’ s, Pyp said.Ghost sniffed at his carved stone likeness and tried a lick . Jon smiled . You ’ re the one deserves an honor, he told the wolf … and suddenly he found himself remembering how he ’ d found him, that day in the late summer snow . They had been riding off with the other pups, but Jon had heard a noise and turned back, and there he was, white fur almost invisible against the drifts . He was all alone, he thought, apart from the others in the litter . He was different, so they drove him out.Jon smiled.My uncle spoke truly, he whispered to Ghost . He wondered if he would ever see Benjen Stark again, to tell him.He is, Jon was forced to say.Jon felt like a fool . [BOS] No . [EOS] Jon told him, keeping his voice low so the others would not hear . [BOS] You have to look, Maester Aemon sent you to be his eyes, didn ’ t he? What good are eyes if they ’ re shut? [EOS] Not until he was well beyond the village did Jon slow again . By then both he and the mare were damp with sweat . He dismounted, shivering, his burned hand aching . A bank of melting snow lay under the trees, bright in the moonlight, water trickling off to form small shallow pools . Jon squatted and brought his hands together, cupping the runoff between his fingers . The snowmelt was icy cold . He drank, and splashed some on his face, until his cheeks tingled . His fingers were throbbing worse than they had in days, and his head was pounding too . I am doing the right thing, he told himself, so why do I feel so bad?Who else, my lord?You can ’ t hear yourself fart.Once, the old man said . Once . So you see, Jon, I do know … and knowing, I will not tell you stay or go . You must make that choice yourself, and live with it all the rest of your days . As I have . His voice fell to a whisper . As I have …Arya gave him a whap on the arm with the flat of her blade . The blow stung, but Jon found himself grinning like an idiot . I know which end to use, Arya said . A doubtful look crossed her face . Septa Mordane will take it away from me.Jon said icily . [BOS] Lord Eddard Stark was not a man to sleep with whores, His honor— [EOS] Once he swore his vow, the Wall would be his home until he was old as Maester Aemon . I have not sworn yet, he muttered . He was no outlaw, bound to take the black or pay the penalty for his crimes . He had come here freely, and he might leave freely … until he said the words . He need only ride on, and he could leave it all behind . By the time the moon was full again, he would be back in Winterfell with his brothers.After that, Mormont rode in silence, brooding . Jon followed close behind him; as the Lord Commander ’ s steward, that was his place . The day was grey, damp, overcast, the sort of day that made you wish for rain . No wind stirred the wood; the air hung humid and heavy, and Jon ’ s clothes clung to his skin . It was warm . Too warm . The Wall was weeping copiously, had been weeping for days, and sometimes Jon even imagined it was shrinking.Yet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs, his chest rose and fell with each shallow breath.The maester is abed, as you should be . Come back on the morrow and maybe he ’ ll see you . He began to shut the door.Jon corrected . He was pleased by the dwarf ’ s comment, but he tried not to let it show . [BOS] Half brothers, [EOS] Jon was taken aback . It was true, Lord Eddard had often made Robb part of his councils back at Winterfell . Could Sam be right? Even a bastard could rise high in the Night ’ s Watch, they said . [BOS] I never asked for this, [EOS] he said stubbornly.Jon said . [BOS] I ’ ll take that wager, Ser Alliser, I ’ d love to see Ghost juggle . [EOS] Jon turned on him in a fury . [BOS] I see Ser Alliser ’ s bloody hand, that ’ s all I see . He wanted to shame me, and he has . [EOS] Did I offend you? Lannister said . Sorry . Dwarfs don ’ t have to be tactful . Generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head . He grinned . You are the bastard, though.Jon hesitated, then nodded slowly . [BOS] Can you climb down, or shall I bring a ladder? [EOS] The largest structure ever built by the hands of man, Benjen Stark had told Jon on the kingsroad when they had first caught sight of the Wall in the distance . And beyond a doubt the most useless, Tyrion Lannister had added with a grin, but even the Imp grew silent as they rode closer . You could see it from miles off, a pale blue line across the northern horizon, stretching away to the east and west and vanishing in the far distance, immense and unbroken . This is the end of the world, it seemed to say.You don ’ t have to tell me the words, I know them as well as you do . He was angry now . Why couldn ’ t they let him go in peace? They were only making it harder.The next morning Jon heard Rast tell Albett and Toad how his razor had slipped while he shaved.Jon remained standing . [BOS] It ’ s my father, isn ’ t it? [EOS] Shall I call the guards?Jon had the logs crackling merrily by the time Chett led in Maester Aemon . The old man was clad in his bed robe, but around his throat was the chain collar of his order . A maester did not remove it even to sleep . [BOS] The chair beside the fire would be pleasant, [EOS] he said when he felt the warmth on his face . When he was settled comfortably, Chett covered his legs with a fur and went to stand by the door.He missed his true brothers: little Rickon, bright eyes shining as he begged for a sweet; Robb, his rival and best friend and constant companion; Bran, stubborn and curious, always wanting to follow and join in whatever Jon and Robb were doing . He missed the girls too, even Sansa, who never called him anything but my half brother since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant . And Arya … he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes, so fierce and willful . Arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had … yet she could always make Jon smile . He would give anything to be with her now, to muss up her hair once more and watch her make a face, to hear her finish a sentence with him.You are your mother ’ s trueborn son of Lannister.Why? Sam asked.His uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag, but there was always a hint of laughter in his blue-grey eyes . He dressed in black, as befitted a man of the Night ’ s Watch . Tonight it was rich black velvet, with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle . A heavy silver chain was looped round his neck . Benjen watched Ghost with amusement as he ate his onion . A very quiet wolf, he observed.And then he heard the laughter, sharp and cruel as a whip, and the voice of Ser Alliser Thorne . Not only a bastard, but a traitor ’ s bastard, he was telling the men around him.The woods fell silent . You knelt as boys, Bowen Marsh intoned solemnly . Rise now as men of the Night ’ s Watch.Halder lifted the sword for another blow . Cut us off a ham! Rast urged, laughing.I won.Are you well, Snow? Lord Mormont asked, scowling.Your duty is here now, the Lord Commander reminded him . Your old life ended when you took the black . His bird made a raucous echo . Black . Mormont took no notice . Whatever they do in King ’ s Landing is none of our concern . When Jon did not answer, the old man finished his wine and said, You ’ re free to go . I ’ ll have no further need of you today . On the morrow you can help me write that letter.Sit, Ghost, Jon commanded . That ’ s it . Keep still . He looked up at the dwarf . You can touch him now . He won ’ t move until I tell him to . I ’ ve been training him.The raven flapped down and landed on the table, strutting toward the sword, head cocked curiously . Jon hesitated . He had no inkling what this meant . My lord?Maester Aemon touched his own collar lightly, his bony, wrinkled finger stroking the heavy metal links . Go on.Talking with Sam, he said.Do you ever find anyone in your dream? Sam asked.He had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him . Robb would someday inherit Winterfell, would command great armies as the Warden of the North . Bran and Rickon would be Robb ’ s bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name . His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own . But what place could a bastard hope to earn?Lannister studied his face . Yes, he said . I can see it . You have more of the north in you than your brothers.Jon smiled.If truth be told, we expected you to do just as you did . Mormont tried a plum, spit out the pit . I ordered a watch kept over you . You were seen leaving . If your brothers had not fetched you back, you would have been taken along the way, and not by friends . Unless you have a horse with wings like a raven . Do you?Tyrion Lannister sat across from him, sniffing at the stew suspiciously . Barley, onion, carrot, he muttered . Someone should tell the cooks that turnip isn ’ t a meat.The other boys gathered round the eight who had been named, laughing and cursing and offering congratulations . Halder smacked Toad on the butt with the flat of his sword and shouted, Toad, of the Night ’ s Watch! Yelling that a black brother needed a horse, Pyp leapt onto Grenn ’ s shoulders, and they tumbled to the ground, rolling and punching and hooting . Dareon dashed inside the armory and returned with a skin of sour red . As they passed the wine from hand to hand, grinning like fools, Jon noticed Samwell Tarly standing by himself beneath a bare dead tree in the corner of the yard . Jon offered him the skin . A swallow of wine?One against seven? Halder gave a signal . The boys spread out, surrounding him.I am not, Grenn said.Jon reached back for his sword, but one of them grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back . [BOS] Try . [EOS] Maybe it is so, Maester Aemon said . Tell me, Chett, what would you have us do with such a boy?Jon said . [BOS] I don ’ t care, I don ’ t care about them and I don ’ t care about you or Thorne or Benjen Stark or any of it . I hate it here . It ’ s too … it ’ s cold . [EOS] Burn them, someone whispered . One of the rangers; Jon could not have said who . Yes, burn them, a second voice urged.Cold? A hard frost was settling over the castle, and Jon could hear the soft crunch of grey weeds beneath his boots.His sore shoulder made the work go slowly . It was late afternoon before Jon finished graveling the paths . He lingered on high to watch the sun go down, turning the western sky the color of blood . Finally, as dusk was settling over the north, Jon rolled the empty barrels back into the cage and signaled the winch men to lower him.Jon said, pointing . [BOS] There ’ s a winch, They can draw you up in a cage . [EOS] No, he answered, sullen.Jon said . [BOS] First lesson, Stick them with the pointy end . [EOS] My lord, what will happen to him? Will they kill him?The sound faded slowly to silence . One blast meant rangers returning, and Jon thought, I was a ranger for one day, at least . Whatever may come, they cannot take that away from me.Don ’ t call me Lord Snow.He heard Grenn whispering behind him . There ’ s no godswood here . Is there? I never saw a godswood.His lord father had come first, escorting the queen . She was as beautiful as men said . A jeweled tiara gleamed amidst her long golden hair, its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes . His father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat, but the queen never so much as looked at him . Even at fourteen, Jon could see through her smile.Scattered lights flickered through the trees ahead of him, on both sides of the road: Mole ’ s Town . A dog barked as he rode through, and he heard a mule ’ s raucous haw from the stable, but otherwise the village was still . Here and there the glow of hearth fires shone through shuttered windows, leaking between wooden slats, but only a few.The rest of the afternoon passed as if in a dream . Jon could not have said where he walked, what he did, who he spoke with . Ghost was with him, he knew that much . The silent presence of the direwolf gave him comfort . The girls do not even have that much, he thought . Their wolves might have kept them safe, but Lady is dead and Nymeria ’ s lost, they ’ re all alone.The Old Bear ’ s no fool, Dareon observed . You ’ re certain to be a builder, and Jon ’ s certain to be a ranger . He ’ s the best sword and the best rider among us, and his uncle was the First before he … His voice trailed off awkwardly as he realized what he had almost said.You know, Mormont grumbled . How is it that everyone knows everything around here? He did not seem to expect an answer . It would seem there were only the two of … of those creatures, whatever they were, I will not call them men . And thank the gods for that . Any more and … well, that doesn ’ t bear thinking of . There will be more, though . I can feel it in these old bones of mine, and Maester Aemon agrees . The cold winds are rising . Summer is at an end, and a winter is coming such as this world has never seen.… don ’ t … tell … Sansa!Jon sat, and took a sip of wine.For me too, Robb said . He had snow in his hair, melting from the heat of his body . Did you see him?When Jon did not appear to fetch the Old Bear ’ s breakfast from the kitchen, they ’ d look in his cell and find Longclaw on the bed . It had been hard to abandon it, but Jon was not so lost to honor as to take it with him . Even Jorah Mormont had not done that, when he fled in disgrace . Doubtless Lord Mormont would find someone more worthy of the blade . Jon felt bad when he thought of the old man . He knew his desertion would be salt in the still-raw wound of his son ’ s disgrace . That seemed a poor way to repay him for his trust, but it couldn ’ t be helped . No matter what he did, Jon felt as though he were betraying someone.Truly . I ’ m to assist Maester Aemon with the library and the birds . He needs someone who can read and write letters.A direwolf, Jon said . His name is Ghost . He stared up at the little man, his disappointment suddenly forgotten . What are you doing up there? Why aren ’ t you at the feast?The weirwoods were beyond the Wall, yet he knew Sam meant what he said . They are my brothers, he thought . As much as Robb and Bran and Rickon …Ghost backed away from the door . There were deep gouges where he ’ d raked the wood . Jon watched him with mounting disquiet . There ’ s someone out there, isn ’ t there? he whispered . Crouching, the direwolf crept backward, white fur rising on the back of his neck . The guard, he thought, they left a man to guard my door, Ghost smells him through the door, that ’ s all it is.Jon lifted his eyes at the sullen voice . Grenn loomed over him, thick of neck and red of face, with three of his friends behind him . He knew Todder, a short ugly boy with an unpleasant voice . The recruits all called him Toad . The other two were the ones Yoren had brought north with them, Jon remembered, rapers taken down in the Fingers . He ’ d forgotten their names . He hardly ever spoke to them, if he could help it . They were brutes and bullies, without a thimble of honor between them.Ghost ran with them for a time and then vanished among the trees . Without the direwolf, Jon felt almost naked . He found himself glancing at every shadow with unease . Unbidden, he thought back on the tales that Old Nan used to tell them, when he was a boy at Winterfell . He could almost hear her voice again, and the click-click-click of her needles . In that darkness, the Others came riding, she used to say, dropping her voice lower and lower . Cold and dead they were, and they hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every living creature with hot blood in its veins . Holdfasts and cities and kingdoms of men all fell before them, as they moved south on pale dead horses, leading hosts of the slain . They fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children …When Jon had been Bran ’ s age, he had dreamed of doing great deeds, as boys always did . The details of his feats changed with every dreaming, but quite often he imagined saving his father ’ s life . Afterward Lord Eddard would declare that Jon had proved himself a true Stark, and place Ice in his hand . Even then he had known it was only a child ’ s folly; no bastard could ever hope to wield a father ’ s sword . Even the memory shamed him . What kind of man stole his own brother ’ s birthright? I have no right to this, he thought, no more than to Ice . He twitched his burned fingers, feeling a throb of pain deep under the skin . My lord, you honor me, but—Outside, one of the guards looked at him and said, Be strong, boy . The gods are cruel.Jon reminded him sharply . Tyrion Lannister had been a friend to him . If Lord Eddard was killed, she would be as much to blame as the queen . [BOS] Lady Stark is not my mother, My lord, what of my sisters? Arya and Sansa, they were with my father, do you know— [EOS] It was Ghost who knew what to do . Silent as shadow, the pale direwolf moved closer and began to lick the warm tears off Samwell Tarly ’ s face . The fat boy cried out, startled … and somehow, in a heartbeat, his sobs turned to laughter.Do you think your brother ’ s war is more important than ours? the old man barked.Dogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls . One of them, a black mongrel bitch with long yellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken . She stopped and edged under the bench to get a share . Jon watched the confrontation . The bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer . Ghost looked up, silent, and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes . The bitch snapped an angry challenge . She was three times the size of the direwolf pup . Ghost did not move . He stood over his prize and opened his mouth, baring his fangs . The bitch tensed, barked again, then thought better of this fight . She turned and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save her pride . Ghost went back to his meal.Ghost backed away from him uncertainly.Ours is a striding huntsman, Samwell Tarly said.Jon smiled . [BOS] Lord Rowan of Goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter . The girl was two years older, and Dareon swears she helped him through her window, but under her father ’ s eye she named it rape, so here he is . When Maester Aemon heard him sing, he said his voice was honey poured over thunder . Toad sometimes sings too, if you call it singing . Drinking songs he learned in his father ’ s winesink . Pyp says his voice is piss poured over a fart . [EOS] They laughed at that together.Halder gave an apologetic shrug . I helped Pate carve the stone for the pommel, the builder said, and your friend Sam bought the garnets in Mole ’ s Town.The stewards! For a moment Jon could not believe what he had heard . Mormont must have read it wrong . He started to rise, to open his mouth, to tell them there had been a mistake … and then he saw Ser Alliser studying him, eyes shiny as two flakes of obsidian, and he knew.Doubtless you loved your father, Mormont said when Jon brought him his horn . The things we love destroy us every time, lad . Remember when I told you that?You wouldn ’ t see a herd of aurochs until they trampled you into the snow, Pyp whispered back.Inside, the hall was immense and drafty, even with a fire roaring in its great hearth . Crows nested in the timbers of its lofty ceiling . Jon heard their cries overhead as he accepted a bowl of stew and a heel of black bread from the day ’ s cooks . Grenn and Toad and some of the others were seated at the bench nearest the warmth, laughing and cursing each other in rough voices . Jon eyed them thoughtfully for a moment . Then he chose a spot at the far end of the hall, well away from the other diners.Jon snapped angrily . [BOS] Stop it! [EOS] You and everyone else, said Matthar . Every man who wore the black walked the Wall, and every man was expected to take up steel in its defense, but the rangers were the true fighting heart of the Night ’ s Watch . It was they who dared ride beyond the Wall, sweeping through the haunted forest and the icy mountain heights west of the Shadow Tower, fighting Wildlings and giants and monstrous snow bears.Benjen Stark is still First Ranger, Jon Snow told him, toying with his bowl of blueberries . The rest might have given up all hope of his uncle ’ s safe return, but not him . He pushed away the berries, scarcely touched, and rose from the bench.That afternoon, the watch commander sent him to the winch cage with four barrels of fresh-crushed stone, to scatter gravel over the icy footpaths atop the Wall . It was lonely and boring work, even with Ghost along for company, but Jon found he did not mind . On a clear day you could see half the world from the top of the Wall, and the air was always cold and bracing . He could think here, and he found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly … and, oddly, of Tyrion Lannister . He wondered what Tyrion would have made of the fat boy . Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, the dwarf had told him, grinning . The world was full of cravens who pretended to be heroes; it took a queer sort of courage to admit to cowardice as Samwell Tarly had.Jon put a hand on Sam ’ s shoulder . [BOS] We have a dozen rangers with us, and the dogs, even Ghost . No one will hurt you, Sam . Go ahead and look . The first look is the hardest . [EOS] I think so, Arya said.Do you think I want to spend the rest of my life washing an old man ’ s smallclothes?Robb knew something was wrong . My mother …Jon protested . [BOS] I am almost a man grown, I will turn fifteen on my next name day, and Maester Luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children . [EOS] Awkwardly, Jon took the sword in hand . His left hand; his bandaged right was still too raw and clumsy . Carefully he pulled it from its scabbard and raised it level with his eyes.Jon Snow straightened himself and took a long deep breath . Forgive me, Father . Robb, Arya, Bran … forgive me, I cannot help you . He has the truth of it . This is my place . [BOS] I am … yours, my lord . Your man . I swear it . I will not run again . [EOS] Under black wool, boiled leather, and mail, sweat trickled icily down Jon ’ s chest as he pressed the attack . Grenn stumbled backward, defending himself clumsily . When he raised his sword, Jon went underneath it with a sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boy ’ s leg and sent him staggering . Grenn ’ s downcut was answered by an overhand that dented his helm . When he tried a sideswing, Jon swept aside his blade and slammed a mailed forearm into his chest . Grenn lost his footing and sat down hard in the snow . Jon knocked his sword from his fingers with a slash to his wrist that brought a cry of pain.Ser Jaremy looked startled . Neither did Flowers, he blurted, turning to stare at the dead man.Do we still mount watches?Yes, my lord.Jon looked up happily as his uncle Ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as Jon had ruffled the wolf ’ s . Yes, he said . His name is Ghost.The crow is the raven ’ s poor cousin . They are both beggars in black, hated and misunderstood.A scarred hand is nothing . On the Wall, you ’ ll be wearing gloves often as not.I heard of a man who had a razor made of Valyrian steel, declared Toad . He cut his head off trying to shave.The old man seemed to sense his doubts . Tell me, Jon, if the day should ever come when your lord father must needs choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?Toad sidled close . Your rosy butt cheeks, what else?I would so, Grenn insisted . I ’ d see them a long way off.Jon had noticed that too . A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the truth that people hid behind their eyes . His father was observing all the courtesies, but there was tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before . He said little, looking out over the hall with hooded eyes, seeing nothing . Two seats away, the king had been drinking heavily all night . His broad face was flushed behind his great black beard . He made many a toast, laughed loudly at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside him the queen seemed as cold as an ice sculpture . Jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice . [BOS] The queen is angry too, Father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon . The queen didn ’ t want him to go . [EOS] I prayed for it, she said dully . He was my special boy . I went to the sept and prayed seven times to the seven faces of god that Ned would change his mind and leave him here with me . Sometimes prayers are answered.Gods have mercy, the Old Bear muttered . He swung down from his garron, handing his reins to Jon . The morning was unnaturally warm; beads of sweat dotted the Lord Commander ’ s broad forehead like dew on a melon . His horse was nervous, rolling her eyes, backing away from the dead men as far as her lead would allow . Jon led her off a few paces, fighting to keep her from bolting . The horses did not like the feel of this place . For that matter, neither did Jon.In that case, you had best stay close, the dwarf said . He cocked his oversized head to one side and looked Jon over with his mismatched eyes . I am Tyrion Lannister.My thanks to all of you, the fat boy said gravely.Jon looked around him in sick disbelief . Maester Aemon ’ s blind eyes were raised toward the light he could not see . The septon was arranging crystals on the altar . Only Sam and Dareon remained on the benches; a fat boy, a singer … and him.Jon said in a sudden rush . [BOS] Take me with you when you go back to the Wall, Father will give me leave to go if you ask him, I know he will . [EOS] Jon told the direwolf as he swung up into the saddle . He turned the mare ’ s head to slide off through the trees, but they were on him before he had gone ten feet . [BOS] Traitor, [EOS] Ser Jaremy stood . The Wildlings have axes too.Jon, Samwell Tarly said excitedly . Wait . Don ’ t you see what they ’ re doing?You make us look bad, complained Toad.Jon said . [BOS] I have to go now, Uncle Benjen is waiting . I ’ m to go north to the Wall . We have to leave today, before the snows come . [EOS] He remembered how excited Bran had been at the prospect of the journey . It was more than he could bear, the thought of leaving him behind like this . Jon brushed away his tears, leaned over, and kissed his brother lightly on the lips.Mormont ’ s eyes flicked from Sam to Jon and back again . If the lad has something to say, I ’ ll hear him out . Come closer, boy . We can ’ t see you behind those horses.Wary but excited, Arya checked the hall . Nymeria, here . Guard . She left the wolf out there to warn of intruders and closed the door . By then Jon had pulled off the rags he ’ d wrapped it in . He held it out to her.Even now, he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing . The southron had it easier . They had their septons to talk to, someone to tell them the gods ’ will and help sort out right from wrong . But the Starks worshiped the old gods, the nameless gods, and if the heart trees heard, they did not speak.Sam . Jon stood . What is it? Do you want to see the sword? If the others had known, no doubt Sam did too.Jon called after him . You were hurt, he said . Tomorrow you ’ ll do better.I must be excused, he said with the last of his dignity . He whirled and bolted before they could see him cry . He must have drunk more wine than he had realized . His feet got tangled under him as he tried to leave, and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor . Laughter boomed all around him, and Jon felt hot tears on his cheeks . Someone tried to steady him . He wrenched free of their grip and ran, half-blind, for the door . Ghost followed close at his heels, out into the night.Doves and pigeons can also be trained to carry messages, the maester went on, though the raven is a stronger flyer, larger, bolder, far more clever, better able to defend itself against hawks … yet ravens are black, and they eat the dead, so some godly men abhor them . Baelor the Blessed tried to replace all the ravens with doves, did you know? The maester turned his white eyes on Jon, smiling . The Night ’ s Watch prefers ravens.I am the sword in the darkness, Halder intoned.He listened to the sound of hooves growing steadily louder as they trotted briskly down the kingsroad . From the sound, there were five or six of them at the least . Their voices drifted through the trees.This is no concern of Maester Aemon, Chett complained.Ben Stark laughed . As I feared . Ah, well . I believe I was younger than you the first time I got truly and sincerely drunk . He snagged a roasted onion, dripping brown with gravy, from a nearby trencher and bit into it . It crunched.Jon knew Alliser Thorne ’ s voice, but there was a curious note in it that he had not heard before . He turned.He fathered a bastard, a small voice whispered inside him . Where was the honor in that? And your mother, what of her? He will not even speak her name.Jon blurted . [BOS] Let him speak, ser, [EOS] When they finally spied Castle Black, its timbered keeps and stone towers looked like nothing more than a handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow, beneath the vast wall of ice . The ancient stronghold of the black brothers was no Winterfell, no true castle at all . Lacking walls, it could not be defended, not from the south, or east, or west; but it was only the north that concerned the Night ’ s Watch, and to the north loomed the Wall . Almost seven hundred feet high it stood, three times the height of the tallest tower in the stronghold it sheltered . His uncle said the top was wide enough for a dozen armored knights to ride abreast . The gaunt outlines of huge catapults and monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry up there, like the skeletons of great birds, and among them walked men in black as small as ants.No, Ser Alliser said . This is another matter entirely . A bird arrived this morning from Winterfell, with a message that concerns his brother . He corrected himself . His half brother.Donal Noye leaned forward, into Jon ’ s face . Now think on this, boy . None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser . Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley . What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad . They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword . His look was grim . So how do you like the taste of your victories now, Lord Snow?Jafer ’ s right wrist ended in the ruin of torn flesh and splintered bone left by Ghost ’ s jaws . His right hand was floating in a jar of vinegar back in Maester Aemon ’ s tower . His left hand, still at the end of his arm, was as black as his cloak.Jon hesitated . He did feel proud when he won . Why shouldn ’ t he? But the armorer was taking that away too, making it sound as if he were doing something wrong . [BOS] They ’ re all older than me, [EOS] he said defensively.He truly is craven, said Grenn . At supper, there were still places on the bench when he got his pie, but he was too scared to come sit with us.Sam nodded miserably . I hate the cold, he said . Last night I woke up in the dark and the fire had gone out and I was certain I was going to freeze to death by morning.When he turned back at the door, she was holding it again, trying it for balance . I almost forgot, he told her . All the best swords have names.Jon said sullenly . He did not care to talk of his father ’ s death, not even to Mormont . [BOS] I remember, [EOS] The Night ’ s Watch needs all sorts too . Why else have rangers and stewards and builders? Lord Randyll couldn ’ t make Sam a warrior, and Ser Alliser won ’ t either . You can ’ t hammer tin into iron, no matter how hard you beat it, but that doesn ’ t mean tin is useless . Why shouldn ’ t Sam be a steward?Some woman, no doubt . Most of them are . He favored Jon with a rueful grin . Remember this, boy . All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs . And with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast, whistling a tune . When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king.The sword! Matt insisted . The others took up the chant . The sword, the sword, the sword.The sword, Grenn stated . We want to see the sword.We ’ re your brothers now, Grenn said.Arya ran to him for a last hug . Jon warned her, laughing . She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses . [BOS] Put down the sword first, [EOS] Jon tried a practice cut . He was clumsy and uncomfortable with his left hand, yet even so the steel seemed to flow through the air, as if it had a will of its own . [BOS] Longclaw is an apt name . Wolves have claws, as much as bears . [EOS] He could have ridden east, for all you know . Or left the road to cut through the woods . That ’ s what I ’ d do.Jon scarcely heard him . He brushed off Tyrion ’ s hand and strode across the hall . He was running by the time he hit the doors . He raced to the Commander ’ s Keep, dashing through drifts of old snow . When the guards passed him, he took the tower steps two at a time . By the time he burst into the presence of the Lord Commander, his boots were soaked and Jon was wild-eyed and panting . Bran, he said . What does it say about Bran?Toad stepped close . The little lordling has a mouth on him, he said . He had pig eyes, small and shiny . Is that your mommy ’ s mouth, bastard? What was she, some whore? Tell us her name . Maybe I had her a time or two . He laughed.He led the mare off the road, behind a thick stand of grey-green sentinels . Quiet now, he said in a hushed voice, crouching down to peer through the branches . If the gods were kind, the riders would pass by . Likely as not, they were only smallfolk from Mole ’ s Town, farmers on their way to their fields, although what they were doing out in the middle of the night …The black brother made a disgusted noise and opened the door to admit him . Wait in the library . There ’ s wood . Start a fire . I won ’ t have the maester catching a chill on account of you.Something rubbed against his leg beneath the table . Jon saw red eyes staring up at him . Hungry again? he asked . There was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table . Jon reached out to tear off a leg, then had a better idea . He knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his legs . Ghost ripped into it in savage silence . His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their wolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count at this end of the hall, and no one had said a word about his pup . He told himself he was fortunate in that too.Jon told him . [BOS] She was … very kind, [EOS] As you wish, boy, Mormont said . Sam took his seat again, as did Jon . We have placed each of you in an order, as befits our need and your own strengths and skills . Bowen Marsh stepped forward and handed him a paper . The Lord Commander unrolled it and began to read . Halder, to the builders, he began . Halder gave a stiff nod of approval . Grenn, to the rangers . Albett, to the builders . Pypar, to the rangers, Pyp looked over at Jon and wiggled his ears . Samwell, to the stewards, Sam sagged with relief, mopping at his brow with a scrap of silk . Matthar, to the rangers . Dareon, to the stewards . Todder, to the rangers . Jon, to the stewards.Jon said, defiant . [BOS] Call them, You can ’ t stop me from seeing him . [EOS] He crossed the room, keeping the bed between them, and looked down on Bran where he lay.I expect you will want to say your words before a heart tree, as your uncle did, Mormont said.Jon followed the rest back to the armory, walking alone . He often walked alone here . There were almost twenty in the group he trained with, yet not one he could call a friend . Most were two or three years his senior, yet not one was half the fighter Robb had been at fourteen . Dareon was quick but afraid of being hit . Pyp used his sword like a dagger, Jeren was weak as a girl, Grenn slow and clumsy . Halder ’ s blows were brutally hard but he ran right into your attacks . The more time he spent with them, the more Jon despised them.Jon replied . [BOS] Yes, Two of the six he took with him . They ’ d been dead a long time, only … the bodies are queer . [EOS] Jon shook his head . No one . The castle is always empty . He had never told anyone of the dream, and he did not understand why he was telling Sam now, yet somehow it felt good to talk of it . Even the ravens are gone from the rookery, and the stables are full of bones . That always scares me . I start to run then, throwing open doors, climbing the tower three steps at a time, screaming for someone, for anyone . And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts . It ’ s black inside, and I can see the steps spiraling down . Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I don ’ t want to . I ’ m afraid of what might be waiting for me . The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps, but it ’ s not them I ’ m afraid of . I scream that I ’ m not a Stark, that this isn ’ t my place, but it ’ s no good, I have to go anyway, so I start down, feeling the walls as I descend, with no torch to light the way . It gets darker and darker, until I want to scream . He stopped, frowning, embarrassed . That ’ s when I always wake . His skin cold and clammy, shivering in the darkness of his cell . Ghost would leap up beside him, his warmth as comforting as daybreak . He would go back to sleep with his face pressed into the direwolf ’ s shaggy white fur . Do you dream of Horn Hill? Jon asked.What is it, man? Mormont said gruffly.I know . Jon had dragged himself to the common hall to sup with his friends, and the failure of the rangers ’ search had been all the men had been talking of.Tyrion Lannister ’ s laughter steamed in the cold air . I ’ ll be sure to tell your father to arrest more stonemasons, before your tower collapses.Jon urged, ignoring Thorne as best he could . [BOS] Look at him, Halder, There ’ s no honor in beating a fallen foe . He yielded . [EOS] He knelt beside the fat boy.Jon said . He put a hand on Sam ’ s broad shoulder . [BOS] We ’ re not friends, We ’ re brothers . [EOS] Jon repeated bitterly . The armorer could talk about life . He ’ d had one . He ’ d only taken the black after he ’ d lost an arm at the siege of Storm ’ s End . Before that he ’ d smithed for Stannis Baratheon, the king ’ s brother . He ’ d seen the Seven Kingdoms from one end to the other; he ’ d feasted and wenched and fought in a hundred battles . They said it was Donal Noye who ’ d forged King Robert ’ s warhammer, the one that crushed the life from Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident . He ’ d done all the things that Jon would never do, and then when he was old, well past thirty, he ’ d taken a glancing blow from an axe and the wound had festered until the whole arm had to come off . Only then, crippled, had Donal Noye come to the Wall, when his life was all but over . [BOS] Life, [EOS] Her face did not change . Her long auburn hair was dull and tangled . She looked as though she had aged twenty years . You ’ ve said it . Now go away.The high officers arrived in a body; Maester Aemon leaning on Clydas, Ser Alliser cold-eyed and grim, Lord Commander Mormont resplendent in a black wool doublet with silvered bearclaw fastenings . Behind them came the senior members of the three orders: red-faced Bowen Marsh the Lord Steward, First Builder Othell Yarwyck, and Ser Jaremy Rykker, who commanded the rangers in the absence of Benjen Stark.Jon Snow took a step forward . Pyp laid a mailed hand on his arm . [BOS] Jon, no, [EOS] the small boy whispered with an anxious glance at Ser Alliser Thorne.Aemon … Targaryen? Jon could scarcely believe it.Jon said sharply, but the force had gone out of his anger . Suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty . [BOS] Don ’ t call me that! I never … I didn ’ t think … [EOS] Hours later, as the castle slept, three of them paid a call on his cell . Grenn held his arms while Pyp sat on his legs . Jon could hear Rast ’ s rapid breathing as Ghost leapt onto his chest . The direwolf ’ s eyes burned red as embers as his teeth nipped lightly at the soft skin of the boy ’ s throat, just enough to draw blood . Jon said softly . [BOS] Remember, we know where you sleep, [EOS] You ’ ll have to work at it every day . He put the sword in her hands, showed her how to hold it, and stepped back . How does it feel? Do you like the balance?Samwell Tarly must have read their thoughts on their faces . His eyes met Jon ’ s and darted away, quick as frightened animals . I … I ’ m sorry, he said . I don ’ t mean to … to be like I am . He walked heavily toward the armory.Jon ’ s throat was dry . [BOS] You know? [EOS] Jon said . [BOS] I came to see Bran, To say good-bye . [EOS] The Old Bear scratched at his chin . I had forgotten how much a new beard itches, he said . Well, no help for that . Is that hand of yours healed enough to resume your duties?The scabbard was soft grey leather, supple as sin . Jon drew out the blade slowly, so she could see the deep blue sheen of the steel . This is no toy, he told her . Be careful you don ’ t cut yourself . The edges are sharp enough to shave with.Mormont snorted . Because I sent him, why do you think? He ’ s bringing the hand your Ghost tore off the end of Jafer Flowers ’ s wrist . I have commanded him to take ship to King ’ s Landing and lay it before this boy king . That should get young Joffrey ’ s attention, I ’ d think … and Ser Alliser ’ s a knight, highborn, anointed, with old friends at court, altogether harder to ignore than a glorified crow.They kept their pledge . When Aegon slew Black Harren and claimed his kingdom, Harren ’ s brother was Lord Commander on the Wall, with ten thousand swords to hand . He did not march . In the days when the Seven Kingdoms were seven kingdoms, not a generation passed that three or four of them were not at war . The Watch took no part . When the Andals crossed the narrow sea and swept away the kingdoms of the First Men, the sons of the fallen kings held true to their vows and remained at their posts . So it has always been, for years beyond counting . Such is the price of honor.He broke my wrist, Grenn said again, holding it out to Noye for inspection.—did not prevent him from fathering a bastard . Did it?And is your friend Samwell wounded or sick?He is not my father . The thought leapt unbidden to Jon ’ s mind . Lord Eddard Stark is my father . I will not forget him, no matter how many swords they give me . Yet he could scarcely tell Lord Mormont that it was another man ’ s sword he dreamt of …Well and good, said Mormont . You may take your vows here at evenfall, before Septon Celladar and the first of your order . Do any of you keep to the old gods?Jon jammed it open with his boot . [BOS] I need to speak to him now . The morning will be too late . [EOS] There ’ s nothing here.Whatever pride his lord father might have felt at Samwell ’ s birth vanished as the boy grew up plump, soft, and awkward . Sam loved to listen to music and make his own songs, to wear soft velvets, to play in the castle kitchen beside the cooks, drinking in the rich smells as he snitched lemon cakes and blueberry tarts . His passions were books and kittens and dancing, clumsy as he was . But he grew ill at the sight of blood, and wept to see even a chicken slaughtered . A dozen masters-at-arms came and went at Horn Hill, trying to turn Samwell into the knight his father wanted . The boy was cursed and caned, slapped and starved . One man had him sleep in his chainmail to make him more martial . Another dressed him in his mother ’ s clothing and paraded him through the bailey to shame him into valor . He only grew fatter and more frightened, until Lord Randyll ’ s disappointment turned to anger and then to loathing . One time, Sam confided, his voice dropping from a whisper, two men came to the castle, warlocks from Qarth with white skin and blue lips . They slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood, but it didn ’ t make me brave as they ’ d promised . I got sick and retched . Father had them scourged.… certain he came this way?And suddenly Ghost was back, stalking softly between two weirwoods . White fur and red eyes, Jon realized, disquieted . Like the trees …Toad made a face . I hope not . I ’ m sick of looking at those ears of yours.We want to take you back where you belong, Pyp said.Jon cursed them all to their faces . They took no notice . Pyp spurred his horse closer, reciting, [BOS] I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men . [EOS] It should have been you, she told him . Then she turned back to Bran and began to weep, her whole body shaking with the sobs . Jon had never seen her cry before.Pyp lowered his voice . The king ’ s dead.No . They hate you because you act like you ’ re better than they are . They look at you and see a castle-bred bastard who thinks he ’ s a lordling . The armorer leaned close . You ’ re no lordling . Remember that . You ’ re a Snow, not a Stark . You ’ re a bastard and a bully.Jon! Pyp shouted after him.Jon insisted . How could they think his father was a traitor, had they all gone mad? Lord Eddard Stark would never dishonor himself … would he? [BOS] But it ’ s a lie, [EOS] Ghost kept pace with them for almost half a mile, red tongue lolling from his mouth . Man and horse alike lowered their heads as he asked the mare for more speed . The wolf slowed, stopped, watching, his eyes glowing red in the moonlight . He vanished behind, but Jon knew he would follow, at his own pace.Jon shrugged . [BOS] No one cares where you sleep . Most of the old keeps are empty, you can pick any cell you want . [EOS] Once Castle Black had housed five thousand fighting men with all their horses and servants and weapons . Now it was home to a tenth that number, and parts of it were falling into ruin.She giggled at him . It ’ s so skinny.Jon said . [BOS] A direwolf, His name is Ghost . The direwolf is the sigil of my father ’ s House . [EOS] Jon, you can ’ t, Sam said . I won ’ t let you.He ’ s not going to die, Robb said . I know it.The Old Bear rolled up the paper . Your firsts will instruct you in your duties . May all the gods preserve you, brothers . The Lord Commander favored them with a half bow, and took his leave . Ser Alliser went with him, a thin smile on his face . Jon had never seen the master-at-arms look quite so happy.You did not wake me, Maester Aemon replied . I find I need less sleep as I grow older, and I am grown very old . I often spend half the night with ghosts, remembering times fifty years past as if they were yesterday . The mystery of a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion . So tell me, Jon Snow, why have you come calling at this strange hour?One of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he ’ d been telling to make room at the table for their lord ’ s brother . Benjen Stark straddled the bench with long legs and took the wine cup out of Jon ’ s hand . Summerwine, he said after a taste . Nothing so sweet . How many cups have you had, Jon?Jon said softly . [BOS] Untouched, And Ghost is different . The dogs and the horses won ’ t go near them . [EOS] Lord Eddard has been imprisoned . He is charged with treason . It is said he plotted with Robert ’ s brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.We can ’ t be certain.His friends rallied to him . We asked the septon to light a candle for your father, Matthar told him . It ’ s a lie, we all know it ’ s a lie, even Grenn knows it ’ s a lie, Pyp chimed in . Grenn nodded, and Sam clasped Jon ’ s hand, You ’ re my brother now, so he ’ s my father too, the fat boy said . If you want to go out to the weirwoods and pray to the old gods, I ’ ll go with you.I ’ ve been bruised before . He touched his shoulder and winced . The yard was emptying around them.Jon said . [BOS] Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you, Give him my pardons . I would not disturb his rest if it were not important . [EOS] He had no destination in mind . He wanted only to ride . He followed the creek for a time, listening to the icy trickle of water over rock, then cut across the fields to the kingsroad . It stretched out before him, narrow and stony and pocked with weeds, a road of no particular promise, yet the sight of it filled Jon Snow with a vast longing . Winterfell was down that road, and beyond it Riverrun and King ’ s Landing and the Eyrie and so many other places; Casterly Rock, the Isles of Faces, the red mountains of Dorne, the hundred islands of Braavos in the sea, the smoking ruins of old Valyria . All the places that Jon would never see . The world was down that road … and he was here.The clang of steel echoed through the yard as the others joined battle around him . Jon blocked a savage cut at his head, the shock of impact running up his arm as the swords crashed together . He slammed a sidestroke into Halder ’ s ribs, and was rewarded with a muffled grunt of pain . The counterstroke caught Jon on the shoulder . Chainmail crunched, and pain flared up his neck, but for an instant Halder was unbalanced . Jon cut his left leg from under him, and he fell with a curse and a crash.I shall live and die at my post, Grenn added, nodding.But he had not left the Wall for that; he had left because he was after all his father ’ s son, and Robb ’ s brother . The gift of a sword, even a sword as fine as Longclaw, did not make him a Mormont . Nor was he Aemon Targaryen . Three times the old man had chosen, and three times he had chosen honor, but that was him . Even now, Jon could not decide whether the maester had stayed because he was weak and craven, or because he was strong and true . Yet he understood what the old man had meant, about the pain of choosing; he understood that all too well.Let me, a voice said . Thick-fingered hands unfastened helm from gorget and lifted it off gently . Did he hurt you?Then I wouldn ’ t go.Jon stood tall . He told himself that he would die well; that much he could do, at the least . [BOS] I know the penalty for desertion, my lord . I ’ m not afraid to die . [EOS] I would not, Grenn said . I ’ m no oathbreaker . I said the words and I meant them.Who will, chimed the talkative raven . Who will.Mormont himself confirmed Grenn ’ s doubts . Castle Black has no need of a godswood . Beyond the Wall the haunted forest stands as it stood in the Dawn Age, long before the Andals brought the Seven across the narrow sea . You will find a grove of weirwoods half a league from this spot, and mayhap your gods as well.All dwarfs are bastards in their father ’ s eyes.My father is no traitor, he told the direwolf when the rest had gone . Ghost looked at him in silence . Jon slumped against the wall, hands around his knees, and stared at the candle on the table beside his narrow bed . The flame flickered and swayed, the shadows moved around him, the room seemed to grow darker and colder . I will not sleep tonight, Jon thought.They killed my father . Did you expect me to do nothing?He was finishing the last of the pork pie the cooks had served up for supper when Jon sat down across from him . The fat boy ’ s eyes widened at the sight of Ghost . Is that a wolf?When he caught his first glimpse of the Wall looming above the tops of an ancient gnarled oak, Jon was vastly relieved . Mormont reined up suddenly and turned in his saddle . Tarly, he barked, come here.When day broke, Jon walked to the kitchens as he did every dawn . Three-Finger Hobb said nothing as he gave him the Old Bear ’ s breakfast . Today it was three brown eggs boiled hard, with fried bread and ham steak and a bowl of wrinkled plums . Jon carried the food back to the King ’ s Tower . He found Mormont at the window seat, writing . His raven was walking back and forth across his shoulders, muttering, Corn, corn, corn . The bird shrieked when Jon entered . Put the food on the table, the Old Bear said, glancing up . I ’ ll have some beer.The yard had grown deathly quiet . Jon could feel Ser Alliser ’ s eyes . Why are you waiting? he asked Rast and the others in a voice gone deceptively soft, but it was Jon who moved first . Halder barely got his sword up in time.The Old Bear shrugged . A boy king … I imagine he ’ ll listen to his mother . A pity the dwarf isn ’ t with them . He ’ s the lad ’ s uncle, and he saw our need when he visited us . It was a bad thing, your lady mother taking him captive—A deep restlessness was on him as he went back to Hardin ’ s Tower for Ghost . The direwolf walked beside him to the stables . Some of the more skittish horses kicked at their stalls and laid back their ears as they entered . Jon saddled his mare, mounted, and rode out from Castle Black, south across the moonlit night . Ghost raced ahead of him, flying over the ground, gone in the blink of an eye . Jon let him go . A wolf needed to hunt.Jon chewed his lip . The raven flapped its wings at him . [BOS] War, war, war, war, [EOS] it sang.Jon knew that other men accused of treason had been allowed to redeem their honor on the Wall in days past . Why not Lord Eddard? His father here . That was a strange thought, and strangely uncomfortable . It would be a monstrous injustice to strip him of Winterfell and force him to take the black, and yet if it meant his life …The evening meal was almost done by the time he and Ghost reached the common hall . A group of the black brothers were dicing over mulled wine near the fire . His friends were at the bench nearest the west wall, laughing . Pyp was in the middle of a story . The mummer ’ s boy with the big ears was a born liar with a hundred different voices, and he did not tell his tales so much as live them, playing all the parts as needed, a king one moment and a swineherd the next . When he turned into an alehouse girl or a virgin princess, he used a high falsetto voice that reduced them all to tears of helpless laughter, and his eunuchs were always eerily accurate caricatures of Ser Alliser . Jon took as much pleasure from Pyp ’ s antics as anyone … yet that night he turned away and went instead to the end of the bench, where Samwell Tarly sat alone, as far from the others as he could get.This man wears a hunting horn . Mormont pointed at Othor . Must I suppose that he died without sounding it? Or have your rangers all gone deaf as well as blind?They had moved him back to his old cell in tumbledown Hardin ’ s Tower after the fire, and it was there he returned . Ghost was curled up asleep beside the door, but he lifted his head at the sound of Jon ’ s boots . The direwolf ’ s red eyes were darker than garnets and wiser than men . Jon knelt, scratched his ear, and showed him the pommel of the sword . Look . It ’ s you.Jon said . There had been others . Too many . [BOS] No, [EOS] What if the sky was cloudy? Pyp asked.Good . On the table between them, Lord Mormont laid a large sword in a black metal scabbard banded with silver . Here . You ’ ll be ready for this, then.Maester Aemon was gentler . Is your friend a hunter?Jon saw the start of fright on Sam ’ s face as he lumbered up on his mare; doubtless he thought he was in trouble . You ’ re fat but you ’ re not stupid, boy, the Old Bear said gruffly . You did well back there . And you, Snow.The Old Bear was accustomed to rise at first light, so Jon had until dawn to put as many leagues as he could between him and the Wall … if Sam Tarly did not betray him . The fat boy was dutiful and easily frightened, but he loved Jon like a brother . If questioned, Sam would doubtless tell them the truth, but Jon could not imagine him braving the guards in front of the King ’ s Tower to wake Mormont from sleep.I told you to sit, Mormont grumbled . Sit, the raven screamed . And have a drink, damn you . That ’ s a command, Snow.Jon lied … loudly, as if that could make it true . [BOS] I am, my lord, And you? [EOS] Ser Jaremy bristled, his face taut with anger . No horn was blown, my lord, or my rangers would have heard it . I do not have sufficient men to mount as many patrols as I should like … and since Benjen was lost, we have stayed closer to the Wall than we were wont to do before, by your own command.Something ’ s wrong, Jon thought . Something ’ s very wrong.Jon said . Ghost ’ s head lifted . He seemed to taste the air . In the blink of an eye he was off, racing across the broad, weed-choked field to vanish in the trees . [BOS] Yes, my lord, [EOS] Jon nodded . He should have come straight from the stable . He climbed the tower steps briskly . He wants wine or a fire in his hearth, that ’ s all, he told himself.Pyp let fly a whoop and thrust his sword into the air . Ser Alliser fixed him with a reptile stare . They will call you men of Night ’ s Watch now, but you are bigger fools than the Mummer ’ s Monkey here if you believe that . You are boys still, green and stinking of summer, and when the winter comes you will die like flies . And with that, Ser Alliser Thorne took his leave of them.The weariness came on him suddenly, as he donned the roughspun blacks that were their everyday wear . He sat on a bench, his fingers fumbling with the fastenings on his cloak . So cold, he thought, remembering the warm halls of Winterfell, where the hot waters ran through the walls like blood through a man ’ s body . There was scant warmth to be found in Castle Black; the walls were cold here, and the people colder.Jon was in no mood for anyone ’ s counsel . [BOS] What do you know about being a bastard? [EOS] The guards smiled at him from their niches as he wound his way down the turret stair, carrying the sword in his good hand . Sweet steel, one man said . You earned that, Snow, another told him . Jon made himself smile back at them, but his heart was not in it . He knew he should be pleased, yet he did not feel it . His hand ached, and the taste of anger was in his mouth, though he could not have said who he was angry with or why.The Bastard speaks and the peasants tremble, the master-at-arms said in that sharp, cold voice of his . I remind you that I am the master-at-arms here, Lord Snow.He ’ s frightened . We ’ re leaving him . He remembered the day he had left Winterfell, all the bittersweet farewells; Bran lying broken, Robb with snow in his hair, Arya raining kisses on him after he ’ d given her Needle . Once we say our words, we ’ ll all have duties to attend to . Some of us may be sent away, to Eastwatch or the Shadow Tower . Sam will remain in training, with the likes of Rast and Cuger and these new boys who are coming up the kingsroad . Gods only know what they ’ ll be like, but you can bet Ser Alliser will send them against him, first chance he gets.Rangers with me, Ser Jaremy Rykker called when they were gone . Pyp was staring at Jon as he got slowly to his feet . His ears were red . Grenn, grinning broadly, did not seem to realize that anything was amiss . Matt and Toad fell in beside them, and they followed Ser Jaremy from the sept.My son brought dishonor to House Mormont, but at least he had the grace to leave the sword behind when he fled . My sister returned it to my keeping, but the very sight of it reminded me of Jorah ’ s shame, so I put it aside and thought no more of it until we found it in the ashes of my bedchamber . The original pommel was a bear ’ s head, silver, yet so worn its features were all but indistinguishable . For you, I thought a white wolf more apt . One of our builders is a fair stonecarver.Off in the trees, the distant scream of some frightened animal made him look up . His mare whinnied nervously . Had his wolf found some prey? He cupped his hands around his mouth . Ghost! he shouted . Ghost, to me . The only answer was a rush of wings behind him as an owl took flight.Jon could scarcely follow what he was saying . [BOS] My lord, I don ’ t understand . What ’ s happened to my father? [EOS] Jon lowered the sword . [BOS] Why? [EOS] he said, stupidly.Samwell Tarly awaited them in the old stables, slumped on the ground against a bale of hay, too anxious to sleep . He rose and brushed himself off . I … I ’ m glad they found you, Jon.Pyp made a grimace . You did all you could.Marsh turned his smile on Jon . Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward, Jon . You ’ ll sleep in a cell beneath his chambers, in the Lord Commander ’ s tower.We ’ re sorry about your father, Grenn said, but it doesn ’ t matter . Once you say the words, you can ’ t leave, no matter what.Dywen, the gnarled old forester who liked to boast that he could smell snow coming on, sidled closer to the corpses and took a whiff . Well, they ’ re no pansy flowers, but … m ’ lord has the truth of it . There ’ s no corpse stink.Jon? He looked up . Samwell Tarly stood rocking nervously on his heels . His cheeks were red, and he was wrapped in a heavy fur cloak that made him look ready for hibernation.Jon said warily . There was a trap here . He felt it closing around him . [BOS] Ser Rodrik Cassel, [EOS] Don ’ t you believe it, I just fed him, the Old Bear growled . He was seated by the window, reading a letter . Bring me a cup of wine, and pour one for yourself.… and saw Lord Mormont, naked and groggy from sleep, standing in the doorway with an oil lamp in hand . Gnawed and fingerless, the arm thrashed on the floor, wriggling toward him.Jon said . The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him; the blood of the First Men flowed in the veins of the Starks . [BOS] Yes, my lord, [EOS] I see, Lannister said . He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost ’ s ears and said, Nice wolf.Jon sat under the trees and ate his biscuit and cheese while his mare grazed along the kingsroad . He kept the apple for last . It had gone a little soft, but the flesh was still tart and juicy . He was down to the core when he heard the sounds: horses, and from the north . Quickly Jon leapt up and strode to his mare . Could he outrun them? No, they were too close, they ’ d hear him for a certainty, and if they were from Castle Black …Jon wondered if Joffrey would keep his father as the King ’ s Hand . It did not seem likely . That might mean Lord Eddard would return to Winterfell, and his sisters as well . He might even be allowed to visit them, with Lord Mormont ’ s permission . It would be good to see Arya ’ s grin again and to talk with his father . I will ask him about my mother, he resolved . I am a man now, it is past time he told me . Even if she was a whore, I don ’ t care, I want to know . [BOS] They were as close as brothers, once . [EOS] Claw, the raven cried . Claw.He wondered what Lord Eddard might have done if the deserter had been his brother Benjen instead of that ragged stranger . Would it have been any different? It must, surely, surely … and Robb would welcome him, for a certainty . He had to, or else …You are as hopeless as any boys I have ever trained, Ser Alliser Thorne announced when they had all assembled in the yard . Your hands were made for manure shovels, not for swords, and if it were up to me, the lot of you would be set to herding swine . But last night I was told that Gueren is marching five new boys up the kingsroad . One or two may even be worth the price of piss . To make room for them, I have decided to pass eight of you on to the Lord Commander to do with as he will . He called out the names one by one . Toad . Stone Head . Aurochs . Lover . Pimple . Monkey . Ser Loon . Last, he looked at Jon . And the Bastard.He looked at the words, but they didn ’ t matter . Nothing mattered . Bran was going to live . My brother is going to live, he told Mormont . The Lord Commander shook his head, gathered up a fistful of corn, and whistled . The raven flew to his shoulder, crying, Live! Live!When they emerged from under the trees, Mormont spurred his tough little garron to a trot . Ghost came streaking out from the woods to meet them, licking his chops, his muzzle red from prey . High above, the men on the Wall saw the column approaching . Jon heard the deep, throaty call of the watchman ’ s great horn, calling out across the miles; a single long blast that shuddered through the trees and echoed off the ice.Jon raised the hood of his heavy cloak and gave the horse her head . Castle Black was silent and still as he rode out, with Ghost racing at his side . Men watched from the Wall behind him, he knew, but their eyes were turned north, not south . No one would see him go, no one but Sam Tarly, struggling back to his feet in the dust of the old stables . He hoped Sam hadn ’ t hurt himself, falling like that . He was so heavy and so ungainly, it would be just like him to break a wrist or twist his ankle getting out of the way . Jon said aloud . [BOS] I warned him, It was nothing to do with him, anyway . [EOS] He flexed his burned hand as he rode, opening and closing the scarred fingers . They still pained him, but it felt good to have the wrappings off.Wise boys, Lannister said . Then he changed the subject . The talk is, your uncle is too long away.Thorne strode toward him, crisp black leathers whispering faintly as he moved . He was a compact man of fifty years, spare and hard, with grey in his black hair and eyes like chips of onyx . The truth now, he commanded.Jon kept silent.Does that mean …?Jon was hungry too, so he fell in beside Lannister and slowed his pace to match the dwarf ’ s awkward, waddling steps . The wind was rising, and they could hear the old wooden buildings creaking around them, and in the distance a heavy shutter banging, over and over, forgotten . Once there was a muffled thump as a blanket of snow slid from a roof and landed near them.I would not, Grenn insisted . I ’ d run away faster than you . He stopped suddenly, scowling when he saw Pyp ’ s grin and realized what he ’ d just said . His thick neck flushed a dark red . Jon left them there arguing as he returned to the armory, hung up his sword, and stripped off his battered armor.Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle . Who knows? He was feeling better now . He was not going to let himself be sad . I better go . I ’ ll spend my first year on the Wall emptying chamber pots if I keep Uncle Ben waiting any longer.Jon had no answer for him . The raven was pecking at an egg, breaking the shell . Pushing his beak through the hole, he pulled out morsels of white and yoke.Matthar had circled behind him . He joined the chorus . I pledge my life and honor to the Night ’ s Watch.I have no place, Jon wanted to say, I ’ m a bastard, I have no rights, no name, no mother, and now not even a father . The words would not come . I don ’ t know.See that you never forget it . The hard truths are the ones to hold tight . Fetch me my plate . Is it ham again? So be it . You look weary . Was your moonlight ride so tiring?Jon pointed out forcefully, disgusted . [BOS] He ’ s blind, I can find the way myself . [EOS] He left Sam standing there, openmouthed and quivering.Jon climbed into his saddle . When Bowen Marsh and their ranger escort had mounted, Jon put two fingers in his mouth and whistled . Ghost came loping out of the tunnel . [BOS] They never have . [EOS] Jon breathed, scrambling to his feet . [BOS] Bran, Something ’ s happened to Bran . [EOS] Dareon broke off and lifted his visor . Seven gods, he murmured . Would you look at this, Jon.Samwell Tarly looked at him for a long moment, and his round face seemed to cave in on itself . He sat down on the frost-covered ground and began to cry, huge choking sobs that made his whole body shake . Jon Snow could only stand and watch . Like the snowfall on the barrowlands, it seemed the tears would never end.Even then, Ser Alliser would not call an end . On your feet, Ser Piggy, he called . Pick up your sword . When the boy continued to cling to the ground, Thorne gestured to Halder . Hit him with the flat of your blade until he finds his feet . Halder delivered a tentative smack to his foe ’ s upraised cheeks . You can hit harder than that, Thorne taunted . Halder took hold of his longsword with both hands and brought it down so hard the blow split leather, even on the flat . The new boy screeched in pain.Pyp grinned . The Night ’ s Watch is thousands of years old, he said, but I ’ ll wager Lord Snow ’ s the first brother ever honored for burning down the Lord Commander ’ s Tower.Jon said . [BOS] Talk, Have you seen the Wall? [EOS] Jon lowered his eyes . She was cradling one of Bran ’ s hands . He took the other, squeezed it . Fingers like the bones of birds . [BOS] Good-bye, [EOS] he said.The fat boy shook his head . I was heir to my father ’ s blade once, he said mournfully . Heartsbane . Lord Randyll let me hold it a few times, but it always scared me . It was Valyrian steel, beautiful but so sharp I was afraid I ’ d hurt one of my sisters . Dickon will have it now . He wiped sweaty hands on his cloak . I … ah … Maester Aemon wants to see you.Keep out of matters that don ’ t concern you, Lannister . You have no place here.Sam blushed a vivid crimson and tripped over his own tongue as he tried to stammer out a courtesy . Jon had to smile.Let me give you some counsel, bastard, Lannister said . Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not . Make it your strength . Then it can never be your weakness . Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.Jon promised, [BOS] He will be, unless you help . [EOS] The Great Hall of Winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted meat and fresh-baked bread . Its grey stone walls were draped with banners . White, gold, crimson: the direwolf of Stark, Baratheon ’ s crowned stag, the lion of Lannister . A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad, but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the clangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations.Fair? Dareon sneered . The girl was waiting for me, naked as the day she was born . She pulled me through the window, and you talk to me of fair? He walked off.Jon climbed the steps slowly, trying not to think that this might be the last time ever . Ghost padded silently beside him . Outside, snow swirled through the castle gates, and the yard was all noise and chaos, but inside the thick stone walls it was still warm and quiet . Too quiet for Jon ’ s liking.The hushed silence seemed to stretch on and on . From where Jon crouched, he could see the legs of their horses through the branches . Finally Pyp spoke up . What did you hear?—a whore . I heard him . What of it?Take it, echoed his raven, preening . Take it, take it.Jon looked . The armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match . His nose was flat and broad, and he always seemed in need of a shave . The left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword . [BOS] Words won ’ t make your mother a whore . She was what she was, and nothing Toad says can change that . You know, we have men on the Wall whose mothers were whores . [EOS] So they will not love, the old man answered, for love is the bane of honor, the death of duty.He could not see the smile . Hard as he tried, he could not see it . He found himself thinking of the deserter his father had beheaded the day they ’ d found the direwolves . You said the words, Lord Eddard had told him . You took a vow, before your brothers, before the old gods and the new . Desmond and Fat Tom had dragged the man to the stump . Bran ’ s eyes had been wide as saucers, and Jon had to remind him to keep his pony in hand . He remembered the look on Father ’ s face when Theon Greyjoy brought forth Ice, the spray of blood on the snow, the way Theon had kicked the head when it came rolling at his feet.Sometimes I dream about it, he said . I ’ m walking down this long empty hall . My voice echoes all around, but no one answers, so I walk faster, opening doors, shouting names . I don ’ t even know who I ’ m looking for . Most nights it ’ s my father, but sometimes it ’ s Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my uncle . The thought of Benjen Stark saddened him; his uncle was still missing . The Old Bear had sent out rangers in search of him . Ser Jaremy Rykker had led two sweeps, and Quorin Halfhand had gone forth from the Shadow Tower, but they ’ d found nothing aside from a few blazes in the trees that his uncle had left to mark his way . In the stony highlands to the northwest, the marks stopped abruptly and all trace of Ben Stark vanished.Jon had his boot wedged solidly in the door . [BOS] I can stand here all night if I must . [EOS] I ’ m fat, not blind, Samwell Tarly said . Of course I saw it, it ’ s seven hundred feet high . Yet he stood up all the same, wrapped a fur-lined cloak over his shoulders, and followed Jon from the common hall, still wary, as if he suspected some cruel trick was waiting for him in the night . Ghost padded along beside them . I never thought it would be like this, Sam said as they walked, his words steaming in the cold air . Already he was huffing and puffing as he tried to keep up . All the buildings are falling down, and it ’ s so … so …Mole ’ s Town was bigger than it seemed, but three quarters of it was under the ground, in deep warm cellars connected by a maze of tunnels . Even the whorehouse was down there, nothing on the surface but a wooden shack no bigger than a privy, with a red lantern hung over the door . On the Wall, he ’ d heard men call the whores buried treasures . He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down there tonight, mining . That was oathbreaking too, yet no one seemed to care.Arya was in her room, packing a polished ironwood chest that was bigger than she was . Nymeria was helping . Arya would only have to point, and the wolf would bound across the room, snatch up some wisp of silk in her jaws, and fetch it back . But when she smelled Ghost, she sat down on her haunches and yelped at them.All I know is that the blood of the First Men flows in the veins of the Starks . The First Men built the Wall, and it ’ s said they remember things otherwise forgotten . And that beast of yours … he led us to the wights, warned you of the dead man on the steps . Ser Jaremy would doubtless call that happenstance, yet Ser Jaremy is dead and I ’ m not . Lord Mormont stabbed a chunk of ham with the point of his dagger . I think you were meant to be here, and I want you and that wolf of yours with us when we go beyond the Wall.The dogs liked it least of all . Ghost had led the party here; the pack of hounds had been useless . When Bass the kennelmaster had tried to get them to take the scent from the severed hand, they had gone wild, yowling and barking, fighting to get away . Even now they were snarling and whimpering by turns, pulling at their leashes while Chett cursed them for curs.I belong with my brother.The old man is Lord Commander of the Night ’ s Watch, Sam reminded him . You ’ ll be with him day and night . Yes, you ’ ll pour his wine and see that his bed linen is fresh, but you ’ ll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle . You ’ ll be as close to him as his shadow . You ’ ll know everything, be a part of everything … and the Lord Steward said Mormont asked for you himself!I thought so . Mormont peeled the shell off a boiled egg . Your father is dead, lad . Do you think you can bring him back?Jon told him . [BOS] I have one more farewell to make, [EOS] Jon swelled with pride . [BOS] Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but I ’ m the better sword, and Hullen says I sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle . [EOS] The other wight, the one-handed thing that had once been a ranger named Jafer Flowers, had also been destroyed, cut near to pieces by a dozen swords … but not before it had slain Ser Jaremy Rykker and four other men . Ser Jaremy had finished the job of hacking its head off, yet had died all the same when the headless corpse pulled his own dagger from its sheath and buried it in his bowels . Strength and courage did not avail much against foemen who would not fall because they were already dead; even arms and armor offered small protection.Your lord father sent you to us, Jon . Why, who can say?Jon said, dismounting . [BOS] I ’ m not, [EOS] The bastard hamstrung you, opened your empty skull, and cut off your hand . Or would have, if these blades had an edge . It ’ s fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers . Ser Alliser gestured at Jeren and Toad . Get the Aurochs on his feet, he has funeral arrangements to make.Jon said . He took a deep breath to gather his thoughts . [BOS] That ’ s stupid, I remember once I asked Maester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat . [EOS] You girls do as you please, Rast said, but if Thorne sends me against Lady Piggy, I ’ m going to slice me off a rasher of bacon . He laughed in Jon ’ s face and left them there.Ser Endrew? Jon did not know the name.Outside, everything was noise and confusion . Wagons were being loaded, men were shouting, horses were being harnessed and saddled and led from the stables . A light snow had begun to fall, and everyone was in an uproar to be off.Jon told her . [BOS] So are you, I had Mikken make this special . The bravos use swords like this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities . It won ’ t hack a man ’ s head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you ’ re fast enough . [EOS] Jon ’ s fingers were in the bucket, blood up to the wrist . [BOS] Dywen says the wildlings call us crows, [EOS] he said uncertainly.Out of the corner of his eye, Jon glimpsed a pale shape moving through the trees . Leaves rustled, and Ghost came bounding out of the shadows, so suddenly that Jon ’ s mare started and gave a whinny . There! Halder shouted.The men who formed the Night ’ s Watch knew that only their courage shielded the realm from the darkness to the north . They knew they must have no divided loyalties to weaken their resolve . So they vowed they would have no wives nor children.Jon did not remember standing or leaving the solar . The next he knew, he was descending the tower steps, thinking, This is my father, my sisters, how can it be none of my concern.They said the words together, as the last light faded in the west and grey day became black night.As he stood outside the armory looking up, Jon felt almost as overwhelmed as he had that day on the kingsroad, when he ’ d seen it for the first time . The Wall was like that . Sometimes he could almost forget that it was there, the way you forgot about the sky or the earth underfoot, but there were other times when it seemed as if there was nothing else in the world . It was older than the Seven Kingdoms, and when he stood beneath it and looked up, it made Jon dizzy . He could feel the great weight of all that ice pressing down on him, as if it were about to topple, and somehow Jon knew that if it fell, the world fell with it.Septa Mordane, Jon told her . I don ’ t think she ’ d like Nymeria helping, either . The she-wolf regarded him silently with her dark golden eyes . It ’ s just as well . I have something for you to take with you, and it has to be packed very carefully.Keep quiet, all of you, Halder said . I thought I heard something.That ’ s true enough, Benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth . He took Jon ’ s cup from the table, filled it fresh from a nearby pitcher, and drank down a long swallow.You are so, insisted Grenn . You ’ re dumber.Jon demanded . [BOS] What do you want with me? [EOS] No, Maester Aemon said, from the back of the sept. Clydas helped him stand . We took you for a man of Night ’ s Watch … but perhaps we were wrong in that.Ser Jaremy, the Old Bear asked gruffly, Ben Stark had six men with him when he rode from the Wall . Where are the others?Do we have to bind your hands, or will you give us your word you ’ ll ride back peaceful? asked Halder.In the blink of an eye, Jon had vaulted onto the table, dagger in his hand . Pyp made a grab for him, but he wrenched his leg away, and then he was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from Ser Alliser ’ s hand . Stew went flying everywhere, spattering the brothers . Thorne recoiled . People were shouting, but Jon Snow did not hear them . He lunged at Ser Alliser ’ s face with the dagger, slashing at those cold onyx eyes, but Sam threw himself between them and before Jon could get around him, Pyp was on his back clinging like a monkey, and Grenn was grabbing his arm while Toad wrenched the knife from his fingers.The Night ’ s Watch is my House now, Sam said . The Seven have never answered my prayers . Perhaps the old gods will.Jon teased . [BOS] Can ’ t you guess? Your very favorite thing . [EOS] Ser Barristan had been the Old Bear ’ s best hope, Jon remembered; if he had fallen, what chance was there that Mormont ’ s letter would be heeded? He curled his hand into a fist . Pain shot through his burned fingers . What of my sisters?Frowning, Jon continued on his way . He led the mare for half an hour, until she was dry . Ghost did not appear . Jon wanted to mount up and ride again, but he was concerned about his missing wolf . Ghost, he called again . Where are you? To me! Ghost! Nothing in these woods could trouble a direwolf, even a half-grown direwolf, unless … no, Ghost was too smart to attack a bear, and if there was a wolf pack anywhere close Jon would have surely heard them howling.Whatever demonic force moved Othor had been driven out by the flames; the twisted thing they had found in the ashes had been no more than cooked meat and charred bone . Yet in his nightmare he faced it again … and this time the burning corpse wore Lord Eddard ’ s features . It was his father ’ s skin that burst and blackened, his father ’ s eyes that ran liquid down his cheeks like jellied tears . Jon did not understand why that should be or what it might mean, but it frightened him more than he could say.There was . What of it?What did you do now? Jon was amused.The message made no mention of Lord Eddard or the girls . He gave an irritated shrug . Perhaps they never got my letter . Aemon sent two copies, with his best birds, but who can say? More like, Pycelle did not deign to reply . It would not be the first time, nor the last . I fear we count for less than nothing in King ’ s Landing . They tell us what they want us to know, and that ’ s little enough.Bowen Marsh was waiting at the first gate as they led their garrons through the icy tunnel . The Lord Steward was red-faced and agitated . My lord, he blurted at Mormont as he swung open the iron bars, there ’ s been a bird, you must come at once.Benjen Stark stood up . More ’ s the pity . He put a hand on Jon ’ s shoulder . Come back to me after you ’ ve fathered a few bastards of your own, and we ’ ll see how you feel.Jon told him . [BOS] I would sooner not hurt you, Move aside, Sam, or I ’ ll ride you down . [EOS] Lady Stark was there beside his bed . She had been there, day and night, for close on a fortnight . Not for a moment had she left Bran ’ s side . She had her meals brought to her there, and chamber pots as well, and a small hard bed to sleep on, though it was said she had scarcely slept at all . She fed him herself, the honey and water and herb mixture that sustained life . Not once did she leave the room . So Jon had stayed away.The two from the Fingers pulled him off, throwing him roughly to the ground . Grenn began to kick at him . Jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming voice cut through the gloom of the armory . STOP THIS! NOW!They ’ re yours . Jon had hardly tasted Hobb ’ s great feast . I could not eat another bite . He took his cloak from its hook near the door and shouldered his way out.Well, his raven squawked . Well.The pommel was a hunk of pale stone weighted with lead to balance the long blade . It had been carved into the likeness of a snarling wolf ’ s head, with chips of garnet set into the eyes . The grip was virgin leather, soft and black, as yet unstained by sweat or blood . The blade itself was a good half foot longer than those Jon was used to, tapered to thrust as well as slash, with three fullers deeply incised in the metal . Where Ice was a true two-handed greatsword, this was a hand-and-a-halfer, sometimes named a bastard sword . Yet the wolf sword actually seemed lighter than the blades he had wielded before . When Jon turned it sideways, he could see the ripples in the dark steel where the metal had been folded back on itself again and again . This is Valyrian steel, my lord, he said wonderingly . His father had let him handle Ice often enough; he knew the look, the feel.Jon boasted . The wine was making him bold . He tried to sit very straight, to make himself seem taller . [BOS] I forget nothing, I want to serve in the Night ’ s Watch, Uncle . [EOS] Jon pulled off his gloves and warmed his hands in the steam rising from the bowl . The smell made his mouth water . [BOS] It ’ s mutton stew . [EOS] The old men called this weather spirit summer, and said it meant the season was giving up its ghosts at last . After this the cold would come, they warned, and a long summer always meant a long winter . This summer had lasted ten years . Jon had been a babe in arms when it began.Does House Tarly keep the old gods too? Mormont asked.His guard was sprawled bonelessly across the narrow steps, looking up at him . Looking up at him, even though he was lying on his stomach . His head had been twisted completely around.A sword ’ s small payment for a life, Mormont concluded . Take it, I ’ ll hear no more of it, is that understood?Jon told him . [BOS] The Lord Commander listens to you, And the wounded and the sick of the Night ’ s Watch are in your charge . [EOS] Jon said hotly . [BOS] I don ’ t care about that! [EOS] He settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank . The sweet, fruity taste of summerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips.The Tarlys were a family old in honor, bannermen to Mace Tyrell, Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South . The eldest son of Lord Randyll Tarly, Samwell was born heir to rich lands, a strong keep, and a storied two-handed greatsword named Heartsbane, forged of Valyrian steel and passed down from father to son near five hundred years.He was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen ’ s brothers, the Lannisters of Casterly Rock . The Lion and the Imp; there was no mistaking which was which . Ser Jaime Lannister was twin to Queen Cersei; tall and golden, with flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife . He wore crimson silk, high black boots, a black satin cloak . On the breast of his tunic, the lion of his House was embroidered in gold thread, roaring its defiance . They called him the Lion of Lannister to his face and whispered Kingslayer behind his back.Girls don ’ t shave, Arya said.Sam will tell you . Jon did not want to talk of it . I should see if the Old Bear has need of me.No, truly?No . The Aurochs lost.Jon shrugged . [BOS] There ’ s hot cider to drink, or mulled wine if you prefer . Some nights Dareon sings for us, if the mood is on him . He was a singer, before … well, not truly, but almost, an apprentice singer . [EOS] Pycelle makes no mention of them, but doubtless they ’ ll be treated gently . I will ask about them when I write . Mormont shook his head . This could not have happened at a worse time . If ever the realm needed a strong king … there are dark days and cold nights ahead, I feel it in my bones … He gave Jon a long shrewd look . I hope you are not thinking of doing anything stupid, boy.She was holding one of his hands . It looked like a claw . This was not the Bran he remembered . The flesh had all gone from him . His skin stretched tight over bones like sticks . Under the blanket, his legs bent in ways that made Jon sick . His eyes were sunken deep into black pits; open, but they saw nothing . The fall had shrunken him somehow . He looked half a leaf, as if the first strong wind would carry him off to his grave.I heard it too!Jon, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night ’ s Watch take no wives and father no children? Maester Aemon asked.Good . The night will be cold, I ’ ll want hot spice wine . Find me a flagon of red, not too sour, and don ’ t skimp on the spices . And tell Hobb that if he sends me boiled mutton again I ’ m like to boil him . That last haunch was grey . Even the bird wouldn ’ t touch it . He stroked the raven ’ s head with his thumb, and the bird made a contented quorking sound . Away with you . I ’ ve work to do.Chett could stand no more . I ’ ve seen this fat boy in the common hall, he said . He is a pig, and a hopeless craven as well, if what you say is true.Jon found it hard to look away from him . This is what a king should look like, he thought to himself as the man passed.Even his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world . Up here, the genial Benjen Stark he had known became a different person . He was First Ranger, and he spent his days and nights with Lord Commander Mormont and Maester Aemon and the other high officers, while Jon was given over to the less than tender charge of Ser Alliser Thorne.Are you well?Inside the sept, the great crystal caught the morning light as it streamed through the south-facing window and spread it in a rainbow on the altar . Pyp ’ s mouth dropped open when he caught sight of Sam, and Toad poked Grenn in the ribs, but no one dared say a word . Septon Celladar was swinging a censer, filling the air with fragrant incense that reminded Jon of Lady Stark ’ s little sept in Winterfell . For once the septon seemed sober.Tyrion Lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the Great Hall, looking for all the world like a gargoyle . The dwarf grinned down at him . Is that animal a wolf?Ser Alliser never took his eyes from Jon . As the laughter rolled around him, his face darkened, and his sword hand curled into a fist . That was a grievous error, Lord Snow, he said at last in the acid tones of an enemy.Jon said, smiling . [BOS] You ’ ll do well at that, [EOS] A north wind had begun to blow by the time the sun went down . Jon could hear it skirling against the Wall and over the icy battlements as he went to the common hall for the evening meal . Hobb had cooked up a venison stew, thick with barley, onions, and carrots . When he spooned an extra portion onto Jon ’ s plate and gave him the crusty heel of the bread, he knew what it meant . He knows . He looked around the hall, saw heads turn quickly, eyes politely averted . They all know.Jon looked around . [BOS] Lannister . I didn ’ t see—I mean, I thought I was alone . [EOS] Toad sat on the floor, gingerly feeling the back of his head . His fingers came away bloody . He tried to kill me.The watcher on the walls, piped Toad.And he was finding that he had a man ’ s thirst, to the raucous delight of the youths around him, who urged him on every time he drained a glass . They were fine company, and Jon relished the stories they were telling, tales of battle and bedding and the hunt . He was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the king ’ s offspring . He had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their entrance . The procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench, and Jon had gotten a good long look at them all.The order of builders provided the masons and carpenters to repair keeps and towers, the miners to dig tunnels and crush stone for roads and footpaths, the woodsmen to clear away new growth wherever the forest pressed too close to the Wall . Once, it was said, they had quarried immense blocks of ice from frozen lakes deep in the haunted forest, dragging them south on sledges so the Wall might be raised ever higher . Those days were centuries gone, however; now, it was all they could do to ride the Wall from Eastwatch to the Shadow Tower, watching for cracks or signs of melt and making what repairs they could.When they entered the grove, Samwell Tarly turned slowly looking at each face in turn . No two were quite alike . They ’ re watching us, he whispered . The old gods.Like Ice, she said . She looked at the blade in her hand . Does this have a name? Oh, tell me.Of the ride back, Jon Snow remembered little . It seemed shorter than the journey south, perhaps because his mind was elsewhere . Pyp set the pace, galloping, walking, trotting, and then breaking into another gallop . Mole ’ s Town came and went, the red lantern over the brothel long extinguished . They made good time . Dawn was still an hour off when Jon glimpsed the towers of Castle Black ahead of them, dark against the pale immensity of the Wall . It did not seem like home this time.Jon did not know what to say . [BOS] It wasn ’ t your fault, [EOS] he managed after an awkward silence.Finally, after three girls in as many years, Lady Tarly gave her lord husband a second son . From that day, Lord Randyll ignored Sam, devoting all his time to the younger boy, a fierce, robust child more to his liking . Samwell had known several years of sweet peace with his music and his books.I don ’ t know, Halder admitted . A sound, I thought it might have been a horse but …Older and bigger and stronger, that ’ s the truth . I ’ ll wager your master-at-arms taught you how to fight bigger men at Winterfell, though . Who was he, some old knight?Jon could feel his breakfast churning in his belly, but he pressed his lips together and made himself look at the second body . Othor had been a big ugly man, and he made a big ugly corpse . No axe was in evidence . Jon remembered Othor; he had been the one bellowing the bawdy song as the rangers rode out . His singing days were done . His flesh was blanched white as milk, everywhere but his hands . His hands were black like Jafer ’ s . Blossoms of hard cracked blood decorated the mortal wounds that covered him like a rash, breast and groin and throat . Yet his eyes were still open . They stared up at the sky, blue as sapphires.Jon warned him, brandishing his sword . [BOS] Stay back, I mean it, Pyp . [EOS] They weren ’ t even wearing armor, he could cut them to pieces if he had to.They took his knife and his sword and told him he was not to leave his cell until the high officers met to decide what was to be done with him . And then they placed a guard outside his door to make certain he obeyed . His friends were not allowed to see him, but the Old Bear did relent and permit him Ghost, so he was not utterly alone.Jon wished he understood what they were talking about, and why . What did he care about ravens and doves? If the old man had something to say to him, why couldn ’ t he just say it?Then he saw it, a shadow in the shadows, sliding toward the inner door that led to Mormont ’ s sleeping cell, a man-shape all in black, cloaked and hooded … but beneath the hood, its eyes shone with an icy blue radiance …I had hoped for some word of my father.I hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late, Lannister said as they mounted the steps to the common hall . He grinned and pulled open the door . Perhaps the grumkins are hungry this year.Chett tried, cursing, yanking on the leashes, giving one animal a lick of his boot . Most of the dogs just whimpered and planted their feet . He tried dragging one . The bitch resisted, growling and squirming as if to escape her collar . Finally she lunged at him . Chett dropped the leash and stumbled backward . The dog leapt over him and bounded off into the trees.He walked to the Lord Commander ’ s Tower alone, with a curious sense of apprehension . The brothers on guard eyed him solemnly as he approached . The Old Bear ’ s in his solar, one of them announced . He was asking for you.Lady Stark was watching . She had not raised a cry . Jon took that for acceptance . Outside the window, the direwolf howled again . The wolf that Bran had not had time to name.Know, the raven echoed from Mormont ’ s shoulder . Know.Jon snapped . [BOS] They ’ re not my brothers, They hate me because I ’ m better than they are . [EOS] As they led their horses back to the stable, Jon was uncomfortably aware that people were watching him . Ser Alliser Thorne was drilling his boys in the yard, but he broke off to stare at Jon, a faint half smile on his lips . One-armed Donal Noye stood in the door of the armory . The gods be with you, Snow, he called out.Arya disentangled herself from him and made a face . Nothing . I was all packed and everything . She gestured at the huge chest, no more than a third full, and at the clothes that were scattered all over the room . Septa Mordane says I have to do it all over . My things weren ’ t properly folded, she says . A proper southron lady doesn ’ t just throw her clothes inside her chest like old rags, she says.Jon said . The Young Dragon was one of his heroes . [BOS] Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne, [EOS] Maester Aemon smiled . And so?Jeor Mormont, Lord Commander of the Night ’ s Watch, was a gruff old man with an immense bald head and a shaggy grey beard . He had a raven on his arm, and he was feeding it kernels of corn . I am told you can read . He shook the raven off, and it flapped its wings and flew to the window, where it sat watching as Mormont drew a roll of paper from his belt and handed it to Jon . Corn, it muttered in a raucous voice . Corn, corn.Lady Stark looked over . For a moment she did not seem to recognize him . Finally she blinked . What are you doing here? she asked in a voice strangely flat and emotionless.It ’ s not, Mormont told him . Gods save us, boy, you ’ re not blind and you ’ re not stupid . When dead men come hunting in the night, do you think it matters who sits the Iron Throne?Soon enough, Robb promised . He pulled Jon to him and embraced him fiercely . Farewell, Snow.Jon stood up . [BOS] I ’ ll break the other one for you if you ask nicely . [EOS] Grenn was sixteen and a head taller than Jon . All four of them were bigger than he was, but they did not scare him . He ’ d beaten every one of them in the yard.Four that you ’ ve humiliated in the yard . Four who are probably afraid of you . I ’ ve watched you fight . It ’ s not training with you . Put a good edge on your sword, and they ’ d be dead meat; you know it, I know it, they know it . You leave them nothing . You shame them . Does that make you proud?He wheeled his horse around and started for home.Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House? wondered Ser Jaremy Rykker.Jon shrugged . [BOS] No . [EOS] He scattered more meat . The fingers of his left hand were slimy with blood, and his right throbbed from the weight of the bucket.Robb looked relieved . Good . He smiled . The next time I see you, you ’ ll be all in black.Jon shifted the bucket to his right hand and thrust his left down into the bloody bits . The ravens began to scream noisily and fly at the bars, beating at the metal with night-black wings . The meat had been chopped into pieces no larger than a finger joint . He filled his fist and tossed the raw red morsels into the cage, and the squawking and squabbling grew hotter . Feathers flew as two of the larger birds fought over a choice piece . Quickly Jon grabbed a second handful and threw it in after the first . [BOS] Lord Mormont ’ s raven likes fruit and corn . [EOS] Very well . Jon, see to my horse, and tell Ser Jaremy to put the dead men in a storeroom until the maester is ready for them . Mormont strode away grumbling.One of the other boys sniggered . Jon knew better than to reply . He had beaten everyone that Ser Alliser had sent against him, yet it gained him nothing . The master-at-arms served up only derision . Thorne hated him, Jon had decided; of course, he hated the other boys even worse.Fat and awkward and frightened he might be, but Samwell Tarly was no fool . One night he visited Jon in his cell . I don ’ t know what you did, he said, but I know you did it . He looked away shyly . I ’ ve never had a friend before.Suddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent, and they were all looking at him . He felt the tears begin to well behind his eyes . He pushed himself to his feet.I chain him up in the old stables when we ’ re training . They board all the horses in the east stables now, so no one bothers him . The rest of the time he stays with me . My sleeping cell is in Hardin ’ s Tower.Grenn ’ s the ugly one, Pyp said.Your half brothers, a voice inside reminded him . And Lady Stark, who will not welcome you . There was no place for him in Winterfell, no place in King ’ s Landing either . Even his own mother had not had a place for him . The thought of her made him sad . He wondered who she had been, what she had looked like, why his father had left her . Because she was a whore or an adulteress, fool . Something dark and dishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her?We had best hurry, Pyp said . If we ’ re not back before first light, the Old Bear will have all our heads.Jon stood . [BOS] I do, my lord . [EOS] Yes? Mormont growled impatiently . Blood, what of it?Jon drew his longsword . He dared defy Ser Alliser only to a point, and he feared he was well beyond it now.Yet brothers they had, and sisters . Mothers who gave them birth, fathers who gave them names . They came from a hundred quarrelsome kingdoms, and they knew times may change, but men do not . So they pledged as well that the Night ’ s Watch would take no part in the battles of the realms it guarded.It did, once . Longclaw, it was called.Sam blinked at the sudden glare and looked around apprehensively . The Wildlings … they wouldn ’ t … they ’ d never dare come this close to the Wall . Would they?The dwarf dusted himself off and laughed . I believe I ’ ve frightened your wolf . My apologies.Dareon, I am told that you sang at many a high lord ’ s table and shared their meat and mead . We are sending you to Eastwatch . It may be your palate will be some help to Cotter Pyke when merchant galleys come trading . We are paying too dear for salt beef and pickled fish, and the quality of the olive oil we ’ re getting has been frightful . Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive, he will keep you busy between ships.It is only a wood, Jon told himself, and they ’ re only dead men . He had seen dead men before …Jon asked sharply . [BOS] And what will my duties be? Will I serve the Lord Commander ’ s meals, help him fasten his clothes, fetch hot water for his bath? [EOS] Another voice broke in . You know where I ’ d be if it was me? I ’ d be in Mole ’ s Town, digging for buried treasure . Toad ’ s shrill laughter boomed through the trees . Jon ’ s mare snorted.It was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king . Jon ’ s brothers and sisters had been seated with the royal children, beneath the raised platform where Lord and Lady Stark hosted the king and queen . In honor of the occasion, his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine, but no more than that . Down here on the benches, there was no one to stop Jon drinking as much as he had a thirst for.The old gods will be expecting us . He made himself smile.Ghost leapt . Man and wolf went down together with neither scream nor snarl, rolling, smashing into a chair, knocking over a table laden with papers . Mormont ’ s raven was flapping overhead, screaming, Jon felt as blind as Maester Aemon . Keeping the wall to his back, he slid toward the window and ripped down the curtain . Moonlight flooded the solar . He glimpsed black hands buried in white fur, swollen dark fingers tightening around his direwolf ’ s throat . Ghost was twisting and snapping, legs flailing in the air, but he could not break free . [BOS] Corn, corn, corn, corn . [EOS] Her eyes found him . They were full of poison . I need none of your absolution, bastard.It was a long walk down to the yard.Once they had entered the forest, they were in a different world . Jon had often hunted with his father and Jory and his brother Robb . He knew the wolfswood around Winterfell as well as any man . The haunted forest was much the same, and yet the feel of it was very different.Arya seemed puzzled at first . Then it came to her . She was that quick . They said it together:He found Maester Aemon up in the rookery, feeding the ravens . Clydas was with him, carrying a bucket of chopped meat as they shuffled from cage to cage . Sam said you wanted me?Truly, the gods had heard Jon ’ s prayer that night; the fire had caught in the dead man ’ s clothing and consumed him as if his flesh were candle wax and his bones old dry wood . Jon had only to close his eyes to see the thing staggering across the solar, crashing against the furniture and flailing at the flames . It was the face that haunted him most; surrounded by a nimbus of fire, hair blazing like straw, the dead flesh melting away and sloughing off its skull to reveal the gleam of bone beneath.I won ’ t run, if that ’ s what you mean . Ghost moved out from under the trees and Jon glared at him . Small help you were, he said . The deep red eyes looked at him knowingly.It has been close on half a year since Benjen left us, my lord, Ser Jaremy went on . The forest is vast . The Wildlings might have fallen on him anywhere . I ’ d wager these two were the last survivors of his party, on their way back to us … but the enemy caught them before they could reach the safety of the Wall . The corpses are still fresh, these men cannot have been dead more than a day …Stupidly, Jon argued . I ’ ll be fifteen on my name day, he said . Almost a man grown.The direwolf wrenched free and came to him as the wight struggled to rise, dark snakes spilling from the great wound in its belly . Jon plunged his hand into the flames, grabbed a fistful of the burning drapes, and whipped them at the dead man . Let it burn, he prayed as the cloth smothered the corpse, gods, please, please, let it burn.I can too, Grenn insisted.After them came the children . Little Rickon first, managing the long walk with all the dignity a three-year-old could muster . Jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit . Close behind came Robb, in grey wool trimmed with white, the Stark colors . He had the Princess Myrcella on his arm . She was a wisp of a girl, not quite eight, her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net . Jon noticed the shy looks she gave Robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him . He decided she was insipid . Robb didn ’ t even have the sense to realize how stupid she was; he was grinning like a fool.Arya knew what was coming next . They said it together.Why didn ’ t you get up and fight? Grenn demanded.In the dark? Stupid . If you didn ’ t fall off your horse and break your neck, you ’ d get lost and wind up back at the Wall when the sun came up.Gods be good, Dywen muttered . That ’ s a hand.The round fat face looked up at him, suspicious . Why? What will we do outside?Can he plow a field? the maester asked . Can he drive a wagon or sail a ship? Could he butcher a cow?Yes you are . If a bear attacked you in the woods, you ’ d be too stupid to run away.Jon kicked his mare, spinning her in a circle . The boys were all around him now, closing from every side.Benjen gave Jon a careful, measuring look . You don ’ t miss much, do you, Jon? We could use a man like you on the Wall.A silence fell over the wood . For a moment all they heard was Sam ’ s heavy breathing and the wet sound of Dywen sucking on his teeth . Jon squatted beside Ghost.Some of the ravens were still eating, long stringy bits of meat dangling from their beaks . The rest seemed to be watching him . Jon could feel the weight of all those tiny black eyes . And this is my day … is that what you ’ re saying?’ S true . I saw it, one of the rapers put in.Tyrion Lannister swung off the bench and rose . Stop it, Thorne . You ’ re frightening the boy.The Old Bear tapped the letter with a finger . Your father and the king, he rumbled . I won ’ t lie to you, it ’ s grievous news . I never thought to see another king, not at my age, with Robert half my years and strong as a bull . He took a gulp of wine . They say the king loved to hunt . The things we love destroy us every time, lad . Remember that . My son loved that young wife of his . Vain woman . If not for her, he would never have thought to sell those poachers.Do you think they ’ ll keep us together? Pyp wondered as they gorged themselves happily.Jon told them . [BOS] So did I, Don ’ t you understand? They murdered my father . It ’ s war, my brother Robb is fighting in the riverlands— [EOS] The others were still in the common room when Jon returned, alone but for Ghost . Where have you been? Pyp asked.Not my mother, Jon thought stubbornly . He knew nothing of his mother; Eddard Stark would not talk of her . Yet he dreamed of her at times, so often that he could almost see her face . In his dreams, she was beautiful, and highborn, and her eyes were kind.Jon shook off Pyp ’ s hand . [BOS] Halder, enough . [EOS] Dareon and Sam left with him . They descended to the yard in silence . Outside, Jon looked up at the Wall shining in the sun, the melting ice creeping down its side in a hundred thin fingers . Jon ’ s rage was such that he would have smashed it all in an instant, and the world be damned.They set out late that afternoon . The Wall had no gates as such, neither here at Castle Black nor anywhere along its three hundred miles . They led their horses down a narrow tunnel cut through the ice, cold dark walls pressing in around them as the passage twisted and turned . Three times their way was blocked by iron bars, and they had to stop while Bowen Marsh drew out his keys and unlocked the massive chains that secured them . Jon could sense the vast weight pressing down on him as he waited behind the Lord Steward . The air was colder than a tomb, and more still . He felt a strange relief when they reemerged into the afternoon light on the north side of the Wall.Uncle Benjen studied his face carefully . The Wall is a hard place for a boy, Jon.Yes . Jon knelt, and Sam knelt beside him.He ’ s my father, Jon wanted to say, but he knew that Mormont would not want to hear it . His throat was dry . He made himself take another sip of wine.The words hurt, even now . It had been so long, it seemed folly to cling to the hope that Ben Stark was still alive, but Jon Snow was nothing if not stubborn.Pyp grinned . We ’ re not all as dumb as Grenn.You said the words, Pyp reminded him . Now my watch begins, you said it . It shall not end until my death.Chett gave a nasty laugh . I ’ ve seen what happens to soft lordlings when they ’ re put to work . Set them to churning butter and their hands blister and bleed . Give them an axe to split logs, and they cut off their own foot.He should eat, he decided . Food would settle his stomach and give Ghost the chance to catch up . There was no danger yet; Castle Black still slept . In his saddlebag, he found a biscuit, a piece of cheese, and a small withered brown apple . He ’ d brought salt beef as well, and a rasher of bacon he ’ d filched from the kitchens, but he would save the meat for the morrow . After it was gone he ’ d need to hunt, and that would slow him.Bran, he said, I ’ m sorry I didn ’ t come before . I was afraid . He could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks . Jon no longer cared . Don ’ t die, Bran . Please . We ’ re all waiting for you to wake up . Me and Robb and the girls, everyone …A man of the Night ’ s Watch lives his life for the realm . Not for a king, nor a lord, nor the honor of this house or that house, neither for gold nor glory nor a woman ’ s love, but for the realm, and all the people in it . A man of the Night ’ s Watch takes no wife and fathers no sons . Our wife is duty . Our mistress is honor . And you are the only sons we shall ever know.Benjen Stark frowned . A boy you are, and a boy you ’ ll remain until Ser Alliser says you are fit to be a man of the Night ’ s Watch . If you thought your Stark blood would win you easy favors, you were wrong . We put aside our old families when we swear our vows . Your father will always have a place in my heart, but these are my brothers now . He gestured with his dagger at the men around them, all the hard cold men in black.You heard me . I mean to find Ben Stark, alive or dead . He chewed and swallowed . I will not sit here meekly and wait for the snows and the ice winds . We must know what is happening . This time the Night ’ s Watch will ride in force, against the King-beyond-the-Wall, the Others, and anything else that may be out there . I mean to command them myself . He pointed his dagger at Jon ’ s chest . By custom, the Lord Commander ’ s steward is his squire as well … but I do not care to wake every dawn wondering if you ’ ve run off again . So I will have an answer from you, Lord Snow, and I will have it now . Are you a brother of the Night ’ s Watch … or only a bastard boy who wants to play at war?The Lord Commander is not accustomed to waiting, was Ser Alliser ’ s reply . And I am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards.Yes? Maester Aemon prompted.I never saw snow until last month . We were crossing the barrowlands, me and the men my father sent to see me north, and this white stuff began to fall, like a soft rain . At first I thought it was so beautiful, like feathers drifting from the sky, but it kept on and on, until I was frozen to the bone . The men had crusts of snow in their beards and more on their shoulders, and still it kept coming . I was afraid it would never end.To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night ’ s Watch.Chett scowled . The maester is not accustomed to being woken in the night . Do you know how old he is?Jon Snow winced . Halder had been born in a quarry and apprenticed as a stonemason . He was sixteen, tall and muscular, and his blows were as hard as any Jon had ever felt . [BOS] This will be uglier than a whore ’ s ass, [EOS] Pyp muttered, and it was.He hates hunting, Jon had to admit.Jon forced himself to smile back . [BOS] It was always my color . How long do you think it will be? [EOS] That ’ s the one with the broken battlement, no? Shattered stone in the yard below, and a lean to it like our noble king Robert after a long night ’ s drinking? I thought all those buildings had been abandoned.Jon said . [BOS] I don ’ t even know who my mother was, [EOS] Jon corrected . He would not accept that Benjen Stark was dead . Before he could say more, Halder cried, [BOS] Is, Here, you planning to drink that all yourself? [EOS] Pyp snatched the skin from his hand and danced away, laughing . While Grenn seized his arm, Pyp gave the skin a squeeze, and a thin stream of red squirted Jon in the face . Halder howled in protest at the waste of good wine . Jon sputtered and struggled . Matthar and Jeren climbed the wall and began pelting them all with snowballs.The dead men were carried to one of the storerooms along the base of the Wall, a dark cold cell chiseled from the ice and used to keep meat and grain and sometimes even beer . Jon saw that Mormont ’ s horse was fed and watered and groomed before he took care of his own . Afterward he sought out his friends . Grenn and Toad were on watch, but he found Pyp in the common hall . What ’ s happened? he asked.Jon said at once . [BOS] No, That couldn ’ t be . My father would never betray the king! [EOS] Grenn was standing his ground as Jon had taught him, giving Albett more than he cared for, but Pyp was hard-pressed . Rast had two years and forty pounds on him . Jon stepped up behind him and rang the raper ’ s helm like a bell . As Rast went reeling, Pyp slid in under his guard, knocked him down, and leveled a blade at his throat . By then Jon had moved on . Facing two swords, Albett backed away . I yield, he shouted.Oh, be quiet, the Old Bear told it . Snow, how soon does Maester Aemon say you ’ ll have use of that hand back?Pity, we could use a horse like that.It did not bear thinking about . Pain throbbed, deep in his fingers, as he clutched the reins . Jon put his heels into his horse and broke into a gallop, racing down the kingsroad, as if to outrun his doubts . Jon was not afraid of death, but he did not want to die like that, trussed and bound and beheaded like a common brigand . If he must perish, let it be with a sword in his hand, fighting his father ’ s killers . He was no true Stark, had never been one … but he could die like one . Let them say that Eddard Stark had fathered four sons, not three.I know, Jon said . Soon . He looked around at all the noise and confusion . Leaving is harder than I thought.Jon put his spurs to horseflesh, and the mare bolted for the door . For an instant Sam stood his ground, his face as round and pale as the moon behind him, his mouth a widening O of surprise . At the last moment, when they were almost on him, he jumped aside as Jon had known he would, stumbled, and fell . The mare leapt over him, out into the night.You think you had it hard, being a high lord ’ s bastard? the armorer went on . That boy Jeren is a septon ’ s get, and Cotter Pyke is the baseborn son of a tavern wench . Now he commands Eastwatch by the Sea.Jon raked them with an accusing look . [BOS] You knew . [EOS] Sam told the tale in a calm, dead voice, as if it were something that had happened to someone else, not to him . And strangely, Jon thought, he did not weep, not even once . When he was done, they sat together and listened to the wind for a time . There was no other sound in all the world.Uncle Benjen is looking for you, he told Jon . He wanted to be gone an hour ago.Jon said . [BOS] My friends brought me back, [EOS] The guard ’ s sword was in its sheath . Jon knelt and worked it free . The heft of steel in his fist made him bolder . He moved up the steps, Ghost padding silently before him . Shadows lurked in every turn of the stair . Jon crept up warily, probing any suspicious darkness with the point of his sword.Dareon gave him a look . The stewards are fine for the likes of you and me, Sam, but not for Lord Snow.Jon watched her, wary . She was not even looking at him . She was talking to him, but for a part of her, it was as though he were not even in the room.I wanted him to stay here with me, Lady Stark said softly.Too hot, too noisy, and I ’ d drunk too much wine, the dwarf told him . I learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother . Might I have a closer look at your wolf?The Old Bear snorted . Do you think they chose me Lord Commander of the Night ’ s Watch because I ’ m dumb as a stump, Snow? Aemon told me you ’ d go . I told him you ’ d be back . I know my men … and my boys too . Honor set you on the kingsroad … and honor brought you back.Queer? Pyp was all curiosity . How queer?As you wish, Bowen Marsh responded.I can be fast, Arya said.Sam glanced about anxiously . Is it time to go? I shouldn ’ t be late, they might change their minds . He was fairly bouncing as they crossed the weed-strewn courtyard . The day was warm and sunny . Rivulets of water trickled down the sides of the Wall, so the ice seemed to sparkle and shine.Jon said . [BOS] At what? [EOS] And you tell me what you want me to know, and that ’ s less, Jon thought resentfully . His brother Robb had called the banners and ridden south to war, yet no word of that had been breathed to him … save by Samwell Tarly, who ’ d read the letter to Maester Aemon and whispered its contents to Jon that night in secret, all the time saying how he shouldn ’ t . Doubtless they thought his brother ’ s war was none of his concern . It troubled him more than he could say . Robb was marching and he was not . No matter how often Jon told himself that his place was here now, with his new brothers on the Wall, he still felt craven.Pyp followed him . Jon, what is it?The fight lasted less than a minute before the fat boy was on the ground, his whole body shaking as blood leaked through his shattered helm and between his pudgy fingers . I yield, he shrilled . No more, I yield, don ’ t hit me . Rast and some of the other boys were laughing.Lord Steward Bowen Marsh rubbed his plump hands together . Samwell, you will assist Maester Aemon in the rookery and library . Chett is going to the kennels, to help with the hounds . You shall have his cell, so as to be close to the maester night and day . I trust you will take good care of him . He is very old and very precious to us.He mounted, the reins in his hand, and wheeled the horse around to face the night . Samwell Tarly stood in the stable door, a full moon peering over his shoulder . He threw a giant ’ s shadow, immense and black . Get out of my way, Sam.Part of him wanted only to flee, but he knew that if he did he might never see Bran again . He took a nervous step into the room . Please, he said.But now there was no more time.Yes, but … I ’ m such a coward, Jon.There are still direwolves beyond the Wall . We hear them on our rangings . Benjen Stark gave Jon a long look . Don ’ t you usually eat at table with your brothers?The Lord Commander wants to see you . Now.Is that what you did, little sister?Jon answered in a flat voice . [BOS] Most times, But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them . [EOS] Jon said . It wasn ’ t actually true yet, but it would be . [BOS] If I wasn ’ t here, he ’ d tear out your throat, [EOS] Sam edged past Jon and the garrons, sweating profusely . My lord, it … it can ’ t be a day or … look … the blood …The hooded man lifted his pale moon face, and Jon slashed at it without hesitation . The sword laid the intruder open to the bone, taking off half his nose and opening a gash cheek to cheek under those eyes, eyes, eyes like blue stars burning . Jon knew that face . Othor, he thought, reeling back . Gods, he ’ s dead, he ’ s dead, I saw him dead.It must have been warmer where you come from.Ser Alliser Thorne surveyed the scene with disgust . The mummer ’ s farce has gone on long enough for today . He walked away . The session was at an end.Squatting beside the dead man he had named Jafer Flowers, Ser Jaremy grasped his head by the scalp . The hair came out between his fingers, brittle as straw . The knight cursed and shoved at the face with the heel of his hand . A great gash in the side of the corpse ’ s neck opened like a mouth, crusted with dried blood . Only a few ropes of pale tendon still attached the head to the neck . This was done with an axe.Jon said to the fat boy . Ser Alliser had often sent two foes against him, but never three . He knew he would likely go to sleep bruised and bloody tonight . He braced himself for the assault . [BOS] Stay behind me, [EOS] Certainly . Marsh frowned at Jon ’ s tone . And you will run his messages, keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily, and do all else that the Lord Commander might require of you.Unless he was slain as well, Ser Jaremy insisted.Is this one of the direwolves I ’ ve heard so much of? a familiar voice asked close at hand.Then you ’ ll stay and say your words with me?Ser Jaremy shook his head . Would that I knew.When he was gone, Grenn frowned . Nobody likes cravens, he said uncomfortably . I wish we hadn ’ t helped him . What if they think we ’ re craven too?Jon had no time to be afraid . He threw himself forward, shouting, bringing down the longsword with all his weight behind it . Steel sheared through sleeve and skin and bone, yet the sound was wrong somehow . The smell that engulfed him was so queer and cold he almost gagged . He saw arm and hand on the floor, black fingers wriggling in a pool of moonlight . Ghost wrenched free of the other hand and crept away, red tongue lolling from his mouth.Perhaps it was all in the knowing . They had ridden past the end of the world; somehow that changed everything . Every shadow seemed darker, every sound more ominous . The trees pressed close and shut out the light of the setting sun . A thin crust of snow cracked beneath the hooves of their horses, with a sound like breaking bones . When the wind set the leaves to rustling, it was like a chilly finger tracing a path up Jon ’ s spine . The Wall was at their backs, and only the gods knew what lay ahead.Jon had nothing to say to that . He threw meat, wondering why he ’ d been summoned . No doubt the old man would tell him, in his own good time . Maester Aemon was not a man to be hurried.Tyrion Lannister had claimed that most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, but Jon was done with denials . He was who he was; Jon Snow, bastard and oathbreaker, motherless, friendless, and damned . For the rest of his life—however long that might be—he would be condemned to be an outsider, the silent man standing in the shadows who dares not speak his true name . Wherever he might go throughout the Seven Kingdoms, he would need to live a lie, lest every man ’ s hand be raised against him . But it made no matter, so long as he lived long enough to take his place by his brother ’ s side and help avenge his father.You are a boy of fourteen, Benjen said . Not a man, not yet . Until you have known a woman, you cannot understand what you would be giving up.Suddenly he heard the shriek of Mormont ’ s raven . Corn, the bird was screaming . Corn, corn, corn, corn, corn, corn . Ghost bounded ahead, and Jon came scrambling after . The door to Mormont ’ s solar was wide open . The direwolf plunged through . Jon stopped in the doorway, blade in hand, giving his eyes a moment to adjust . Heavy drapes had been pulled across the windows, and the darkness was black as ink . Who ’ s there? he called out.Jon let out a deep sigh . [BOS] You have the right of it . I was acting the boy . [EOS] Jon Snow turned away from the kingsroad to look behind him . The fires of Castle Black were hidden behind a hill, but the Wall was there, pale beneath the moon, vast and cold, running from horizon to horizon.It was too much . Jon frowned, incredulous . Are you afraid of everything? he asked . I don ’ t understand . If you are truly so craven, why are you here? Why would a coward want to join the Night ’ s Watch?Hear my words, and bear witness to my vow, they recited, their voices filling the twilit grove . Night gathers, and now my watch begins . It shall not end until my death . I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children . I shall wear no crowns and win no glory . I shall live and die at my post . I am the sword in the darkness . I am the watcher on the walls . I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men . I pledge my life and honor to the Night ’ s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.Maester Aemon sighed . Have you heard nothing I ’ ve told you, Jon? Do you think you are the first? He shook his ancient head, a gesture weary beyond words . Three times the gods saw fit to test my vows . Once when I was a boy, once in the fullness of my manhood, and once when I had grown old . By then my strength was fled, my eyes grown dim, yet that last choice was as cruel as the first . My ravens would bring the news from the south, words darker than their wings, the ruin of my House, the death of my kin, disgrace and desolation . What could I have done, old, blind, frail? I was helpless as a suckling babe, yet still it grieved me to sit forgotten as they cut down my brother ’ s poor grandson, and his son, and even the little children …The maester nodded . I did indeed . Clydas, give Jon the bucket . Perhaps he will be kind enough to assist me . The hunched, pink-eyed brother handed Jon the bucket and scurried down the ladder . Toss the meat into the cages, Aemon instructed him . The birds will do the rest.We know, said Pyp solemnly . Sam told us everything.Sam gave a tremulous nod, working up his courage with a visible effort . Slowly he swiveled his head . His eyes widened, but Jon held his arm so he could not turn away.We knew even before that, though, Grenn said . Rudge has been helping Donal Noye in the forge . He was there when the Old Bear brought him the burnt blade.Maybe we ’ ll break you, one of the rapers said.Yes, life, Noye said . A long life or a short one, it ’ s up to you, Snow . The road you ’ re walking, one of your brothers will slit your throat for you one night.Blood matted the fat boy ’ s hair where Halder had split his helm asunder . My name is Samwell Tarly, of Horn … He stopped and licked his lips . I mean, I was of Horn Hill, until I … left . I ’ ve come to take the black . My father is Lord Randyll, a bannerman to the Tyrells of Highgarden . I used to be his heir, only … His voice trailed off.Jon drove him backward, attacking with every blow, keeping the older boy on the heels . Know your foe, Ser Rodrik had taught him once; Jon knew Halder, brutally strong but short of patience, with no taste for defense . Frustrate him, and he would leave himself open, as certain as sunset.Moonlight silvered the hills as he followed the twisting ribbon of the kingsroad . He needed to get as far from the Wall as he could before they realized he was gone . On the morrow he would leave the road and strike out overland through field and bush and stream to throw off pursuit, but for the moment speed was more important than deception . It was not as though they would not guess where he was going.Sam got awkwardly to his feet . I had better try to sleep, He huddled down in his cloak and plodded off.When he entered the solar, Mormont ’ s raven screamed at him . Corn! the bird shrieked . Corn! Corn! Corn!There were times—not many, but a few—when Jon Snow was glad he was a bastard . As he filled his wine cup once more from a passing flagon, it struck him that this might be one of them.Life at Castle Black followed certain patterns; the mornings were for swordplay, the afternoons for work . The black brothers set new recruits to many different tasks, to learn where their skills lay . Jon cherished the rare afternoons when he was sent out with Ghost ranging at his side to bring back game for the Lord Commander ’ s table, but for every day spent hunting, he gave a dozen to Donal Noye in the armory, spinning the whetstone while the one-armed smith sharpened axes grown dull from use, or pumping the bellows as Noye hammered out a new sword . Other times he ran messages, stood at guard, mucked out stables, fletched arrows, assisted Maester Aemon with his birds or Bowen Marsh with his counts and inventories.Jon was stunned . Robert Baratheon had looked old and fat when he visited Winterfell, yet he ’ d seemed hale enough, and there ’ d been no talk of illness . [BOS] How can you know? [EOS] Suddenly she looked like she was going to cry . I wish you were coming with us.Jon told him . He had seen little of the dwarf since their journey ended . As the queen ’ s own brother, Tyrion Lannister had been an honored guest of the Night ’ s Watch . The Lord Commander had given him rooms in the King ’ s Tower—so-called, though no king had visited it for a hundred years—and Lannister dined at Mormont ’ s own table and spent his days riding the Wall and his nights dicing and drinking with Ser Alliser and Bowen Marsh and the other high officers . [BOS] You won ’ t learn anything from me, [EOS] And would Joffrey allow it? He remembered the prince at Winterfell, the way he ’ d mocked Robb and Ser Rodrik in the yard . Jon himself he had scarcely even noticed; bastards were beneath even his contempt . My lord, will the king listen to you?Samwell Tarly nodded . I … if you want, you can call me Sam . My mother calls me Sam.Jon nodded . [BOS] Does it have a name, my lord? [EOS] I … he … Jon, I didn ’ t want to … he asked … I mean … I think he knew, he sees things no one else sees …Jon said . [BOS] All we could wasn ’ t enough, [EOS] Finally Jon said, We should go back to the common hall.Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser Alliser Thorne, the maester said gently . Only he may say when a boy is ready to swear his vow, as you surely know . Why then come to me?His words sent a chill of excitement down Jon ’ s back . Beyond the Wall?His eyes stung . Jon rubbed at them savagely, cursing the smoke . He swallowed another gulp of wine and watched his direwolf devour the chicken.By the time he wrenched free, with snow in his hair and wine stains on his surcoat, Samwell Tarly had gone.My lord . The voice made Jon glance back in surprise . Samwell Tarly was on his feet . The fat boy wiped his sweaty palms against his tunic . Might I … might I go as well? To say my words at this heart tree?You can call him Lord Snow, Pyp said as he came up to join them . You don ’ t want to know what his mother calls him.Jon could have told him . He knew, they all knew, yet no man of them would say the words . The Others are only a story, a tale to make children shiver . If they ever lived at all, they are gone eight thousand years . Even the thought made him feel foolish; he was a man grown now, a black brother of the Night ’ s Watch, not the boy who ’ d once sat at Old Nan ’ s feet with Bran and Robb and Arya.Jon said fervently . [BOS] I have to, [EOS] The Watch has need of every man it can get, Donal Noye said when they were alone . Even men like Toad . You won ’ t win any honors killing him.Alliser Thorne overheard him . Lord Snow wants to take my place now . He sneered . I ’ d have an easier time teaching a wolf to juggle than you will training this aurochs.The yard was quiet and empty . A lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall, his cloak pulled tight around him against the cold . He looked bored and miserable as he huddled there alone, but Jon would have traded places with him in an instant . Otherwise the castle was dark and deserted . Jon had seen an abandoned holdfast once, a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones kept silent about whatever people had lived there . Winterfell reminded him of that tonight.His half sisters escorted the royal princes . Arya was paired with plump young Tommen, whose white-blond hair was longer than hers . Sansa, two years older, drew the crown prince, Joffrey Baratheon . He was twelve, younger than Jon or Robb, but taller than either, to Jon ’ s vast dismay . Prince Joffrey had his sister ’ s hair and his mother ’ s deep green eyes . A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past his golden choker and high velvet collar . Sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him, but Jon did not like Joffrey ’ s pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way he looked at Winterfell ’ s Great Hall.Everyone laughed but Grenn . I hope I ’ m a ranger.They ’ ll cut off your head if they catch you, you know, Toad put in with a nervous laugh . This is so stupid, it ’ s like something the Aurochs would do.He is a rare bird, the maester said . Most ravens will eat grain, but they prefer flesh . It makes them strong, and I fear they relish the taste of blood . In that they are like men … and like men, not all ravens are alike.Jon agreed . His voice was flat and tired . The visit had taken all the strength from him . [BOS] You Starks are hard to kill, [EOS] Well, they ’ re going to get all messed up anyway, she said . Who cares how they ’ re folded?Sam stared at the last of his pork pie and gave a feeble shake of his head, too scared even to talk . A burst of laughter filled the hall . Jon heard Pyp squeaking in a high voice . He stood . Let ’ s go outside.A conquest that lasted a summer, his uncle pointed out . Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking the place, and another fifty trying to hold it . Someone should have told him that war isn ’ t a game . He took another sip of wine . Also, he said, wiping his mouth, Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when he died . Or have you forgotten that part?Jon saw at once what Sam meant . He could see the torn veins in the dead man ’ s wrist, iron worms in the pale flesh . His blood was a black dust . Yet Jaremy Rykker was unconvinced . [BOS] If they ’ d been dead much longer than a day, they ’ d be ripe by now, boy . They don ’ t even smell . [EOS] Jon promised her . [BOS] You ’ ll find someone, King ’ s Landing is a true city, a thousand times the size of Winterfell . Until you find a partner, watch how they fight in the yard . Run, and ride, make yourself strong . And whatever you do … [EOS] I know one thing Sam could do better than anyone.When I was little, my father used to insist that I attend him in the audience chamber whenever he held court . When he rode to Highgarden to bend his knee to Lord Tyrell, he made me come . Later, though, he started to take Dickon and leave me at home, and he no longer cared whether I sat through his audiences, so long as Dickon was there . He wanted his heir at his side, don ’ t you see? To watch and listen and learn from all he did . I ’ ll wager that ’ s why Lord Mormont requested you, Jon . What else could it be? He wants to groom you for command!As you say, my lord . It was not the thought of scars that troubled Jon; it was the rest of it . Maester Aemon had given him milk of the poppy, yet even so, the pain had been hideous . At first it had felt as if his hand were still aflame, burning day and night . Only plunging it into basins of snow and shaved ice gave any relief at all . Jon thanked the gods that no one but Ghost saw him writhing on his bed, whimpering from the pain . And when at last he did sleep, he dreamt, and that was even worse . In the dream, the corpse he fought had blue eyes, black hands, and his father ’ s face, but he dared not tell Mormont that.The dwarf lifted an eyebrow . Would you rather be called the Imp? Let them see that their words can cut you, and you ’ ll never be free of the mockery . If they want to give you a name, take it, make it your own . Then they can ’ t hurt you with it anymore . He gestured with his stick . Come, walk with me . They ’ ll be serving some vile stew in the common hall by now, and I could do with a bowl of something hot.The others laughed, and even Jon had to smile . The fire he ’ d started had not, in truth, burned down that formidable stone tower, but it had done a fair job of gutting the interior of the top two floors, where the Old Bear had his chambers . No one seemed to mind that very much, since it had also destroyed Othor ’ s murderous corpse.I should like to hear them both, Sam admitted, but they would not want me there . His face was troubled . He ’ s going to make me fight again on the morrow, isn ’ t he?Yes, my lord, but—And suddenly Jon Snow was ashamed.Jon felt anger rise inside him . [BOS] I ’ m not your son! [EOS] That night, Three-Finger Hobb cooked the boys a special meal to mark the occasion . When Jon arrived at the common hall, the Lord Steward himself led him to the bench near the fire . The older men clapped him on the arm in passing . The eight soon-to-be brothers feasted on rack of lamb baked in a crust of garlic and herbs, garnished with sprigs of mint, and surrounded by mashed yellow turnips swimming in butter . From the Lord Commander ’ s own table, Bowen Marsh told them . There were salads of spinach and chickpeas and turnip greens, and afterward bowls of iced blueberries and sweet cream.When the last lights of Castle Black vanished behind him, Jon slowed his mare to a walk . He had a long journey ahead and only the one horse to see him through . There were holdfasts and farming villages along the road south where he might be able to trade the mare for a fresh mount when he needed one, but not if she were injured or blown.Oh, I learn things everywhere I go . The little man gestured up at the Wall with a gnarled black walking stick . As I was saying … why is it that when one man builds a wall, the next man immediately needs to know what ’ s on the other side? He cocked his head and looked at Jon with his curious mismatched eyes . You do want to know what ’ s on the other side, don ’ t you?Jon said . [BOS] He ’ s not like the others, He never makes a sound . That ’ s why I named him Ghost . That, and because he ’ s white . The others are all dark, grey or black . [EOS] I will . They broke apart and looked at each other awkwardly . Uncle Benjen said to send you to the stables if I saw you, Robb finally said.Why? Why? Why? the raven called.The old man laid a withered, spotted hand on his shoulder . It hurts, boy, he said softly . Oh, yes . Choosing … it has always hurt . And always will . I know.Not everyone, said Halder . It ’ s the builders for me . What use would rangers be if the Wall fell down?Jon glanced warily at Chett, standing beside the door, his boils red and angry . He could help you, he said quickly . He can do sums, and he knows how to read and write . I know Chett can ’ t read, and Clydas has weak eyes . Sam read every book in his father ’ s library . He ’ d be good with the ravens too . Animals seem to like him . Ghost took to him straight off . There ’ s a lot he could do, besides fighting . The Night ’ s Watch needs every man . Why kill one, to no end? Make use of him instead.Aren ’ t you going to eat those? Toad asked.Yes, my lord . Jon slid the sword back into the silver-banded scabbard . If not the blade he would have chosen, it was nonetheless a noble gift, and freeing him from Alliser Thorne ’ s malignance was nobler still.Tyrion Lannister laid a hand on his arm . Jon, he said . I am truly sorry.Thorne smiled . The Bastard wishes to defend his lady love, so we shall make an exercise of it . Rat, Pimple, help our Stone Head here . Rast and Albett moved to join Halder . Three of you ought to be sufficient to make Lady Piggy squeal . All you need do is get past the Bastard.The rangers exchanged glances; they could see it was true, every man of them . Mormont frowned, glancing from the corpses to the dogs . Chett, bring the hounds closer.It was all Jon could do to stop himself from walking out . Was he supposed to churn butter and sew doublets like a girl for the rest of his days? May I go? he asked stiffly.Grenn cradled his hand . The bastard broke my wrist.Maester Aemon turned his head and looked at him with those dead white eyes . It was as if he were seeing right into his heart . Jon felt naked and exposed . He took the bucket in both hands and flung the rest of the slops through the bars . Strings of meat and blood flew everywhere, scattering the ravens . They took to the air, shrieking wildly . The quicker birds snatched morsels on the wing and gulped them down greedily . Jon let the empty bucket clang to the floor.Jon tried to shout, but his voice was gone . Staggering to his feet, he kicked the arm away and snatched the lamp from the Old Bear ’ s fingers . The flame flickered and almost died . Burn! the raven cawed . Burn, burn, burn!One of the guards overheard Clydas reading the letter to Maester Aemon . Pyp leaned close . Jon, I ’ m sorry . He was your father ’ s friend, wasn ’ t he?Dywen and Hake returned last night, the Old Bear said . They found no sign of your uncle, no more than the others did.The sun was sinking below the trees when they reached their destination, a small clearing in the deep of the wood where nine weirwoods grew in a rough circle . Jon drew in a breath, and he saw Sam Tarly staring . Even in the wolfswood, you never found more than two or three of the white trees growing together; a grove of nine was unheard of . The forest floor was carpeted with fallen leaves, bloodred on top, black rot beneath . The wide smooth trunks were bone pale, and nine faces stared inward . The dried sap that crusted in the eyes was red and hard as ruby . Bowen Marsh commanded them to leave their horses outside the circle . This is a sacred place, we will not defile it.Am I? the dwarf replied, sardonic . Do tell my lord father . My mother died birthing me, and he ’ s never been sure.Jon unsheathed Longclaw and showed it to them, turning it this way and that so they could admire it . The bastard blade glittered in the pale sunlight, dark and deadly . [BOS] Valyrian steel, [EOS] he declared solemnly, trying to sound as pleased and proud as he ought to have felt.Best you start thinking, Noye warned him . That, or sleep with a dagger by your bed . Now go.Mormont rounded on him . So you believe this is Mance Rayder ’ s work? This close to the Wall?Maester Aemon ’ s apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery . Aged and frail, the maester shared his chambers with two of the younger stewards, who tended to his needs and helped him in his duties . The brothers joked that he had been given the two ugliest men in the Night ’ s Watch; being blind, he was spared having to look at them . Clydas was short, bald, and chinless, with small pink eyes like a mole . Chett had a wen on his neck the size of a pigeon ’ s egg, and a face red with boils and pimples . Perhaps that was why he always seemed so angry.The Old Bear seemed pleased by that . I suppose they do . You ’ ll want to wear that over the shoulder, I imagine . It ’ s too long for the hip, at least until you ’ ve put on a few inches . And you ’ ll need to work at your two-handed strikes as well . Ser Endrew can show you some moves, when your burns have healed.Her face lit up . A present?Then Lord Eddard is a man in ten thousand . Most of us are not so strong . What is honor compared to a woman ’ s love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms … or the memory of a brother ’ s smile? Wind and words . Wind and words . We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love . That is our great glory, and our great tragedy.For this night …, Halder trotted in from the left.Jon said . He knelt and called out . [BOS] He ’ s not scared, Ghost, come here . Come on . That ’ s it . [EOS] They … they aren ’ t rotting . Sam pointed, his fat finger shaking only a little . Look, there ’ s … there ’ s no maggots or … or … worms or anything … they ’ ve been lying here in the woods, but they … they haven ’ t been chewed or eaten by animals … only Ghost … otherwise they ’ re … they ’ re …Jon ’ s finger traced the outline of the direwolf in the white wax of the broken seal . He recognized Robb ’ s hand, but the letters seemed to blur and run as he tried to read them . He realized he was crying . And then, through the tears, he found the sense in the words, and raised his head . He woke up, he said . The gods gave him back.A lordling, Pyp observed to Jon . Southron, most like near Highgarden . Pyp had traveled the Seven Kingdoms with a mummers ’ troupe, and bragged that he could tell what you were and where you ’ d been born just from the sound of your voice.The memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north.Pyp hopped off his horse and looked at the lightening sky with disgust . Give us a hand bedding down the horses, Sam, the small boy said . We have a long day before us, and no sleep to face it on, thanks to Lord Snow.The wolf had something in his jaws . Something black . What ’ s he got there? asked Bowen Marsh, frowning.And the grumkins and the snarks, Tyrion said . Let us not forget them, Lord Snow, or else what ’ s that big thing for?You go when I tell you to go.Grenn looked thunderstruck . Even Pyp had no words to say to that, and Pyp had words for everything . What sort of man would proclaim himself a coward?Jon blazed back . [BOS] I ’ m a better swordsman and a better rider than any of you, It ’ s not fair . [EOS] I ’ m Jon Snow, Ned Stark ’ s bastard, of Winterfell.Arya ’ s eyes went wide . Dark eyes, like his . A sword, she said in a small, hushed breath.Sam, he admitted . He was not at table tonight.I am sorry to have woken you, Maester, Jon Snow said.Corn, the raven was crying . Corn, corn.Then he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by his brother ’ s side . Tyrion Lannister, the youngest of Lord Tywin ’ s brood and by far the ugliest . All that the gods had given to Cersei and Jaime, they had denied Tyrion . He was a dwarf, half his brother ’ s height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs . His head was too large for his body, with a brute ’ s squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow . One green eye and one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white . Jon watched him with fascination.How did he come here? Sam asked.My uncle ’ s men, Jon thought numbly . He remembered how he ’ d pleaded to ride with them . Gods, I was such a green boy . If he had taken me, it might be me lying here …Spinning, Jon saw the drapes he ’ d ripped from the window . He flung the lamp into the puddled cloth with both hands . Metal crunched, glass shattered, oil spewed, and the hangings went up in a great whoosh of flame . The heat of it on his face was sweeter than any kiss Jon had ever known . Ghost! he shouted.As well, the Lord Commander continued, ignoring the bird ’ s protest, it puts a thousand leagues twixt him and you without it seeming a rebuke . He jabbed a finger up at Jon ’ s face . And don ’ t think this means I approve of that nonsense in the common hall . Valor makes up for a fair amount of folly, but you ’ re not a boy anymore, however many years you ’ ve seen . That ’ s a man ’ s sword you have there, and it will take a man to wield her . I ’ ll expect you to act the part, henceforth.NO, Samwell Tarly squeaked.It is, the Old Bear told him . It was my father ’ s sword, and his father ’ s before him . The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries . I wielded it in my day and passed it on to my son when I took the black.The Lord Steward ’ s garron whickered and backed away from the direwolf . Do you mean to take that beast?The corpse lurched forward . There was no blood . One-armed, face cut near in half, it seemed to feel nothing . Jon held the longsword before him . Stay away! he commanded, his voice gone shrill . Corn, screamed the raven, corn, corn . The severed arm was wriggling out of its torn sleeve, a pale snake with a black five-fingered head . Ghost pounced and got it between his teeth . Finger bones crunched . Jon hacked at the corpse ’ s neck, felt the steel bite deep and hard.The wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon ’ s face, but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion Lannister, and when the dwarf reached out to pet him, he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl . Shy, isn ’ t he? Lannister observed.Good, Mormont said . We ’ ve seen the dead come back, you and me, and it ’ s not something I care to see again . He ate the egg in two bites and flicked a bit of shell out from between his teeth . Your brother is in the field with all the power of the north behind him . Any one of his lords bannermen commands more swords than you ’ ll find in all the Night ’ s Watch . Why do you imagine that they need your help? Are you such a mighty warrior, or do you carry a grumkin in your pocket to magic up your sword?Jon admitted . His arm burned from the weight of the longsword, and he was starting to feel his bruises now that the fight was done . [BOS] I ’ m tired, [EOS]
