They wandered for half the morning . She saw a beautiful feathered cloak from the Summer Isles, and took it for a gift . In return, she gave the merchant a silver medallion from her belt . That was how it was done among the Dothraki . A birdseller taught a green-and-red parrot to say her name, and Dany laughed again, yet still refused to take him . What would she do with a green-and-red parrot in a khalasar? She did take a dozen flasks of scented oils, the perfumes of her childhood; she had only to close her eyes and sniff them and she could see the big house with the red door once more . When Doreah looked longingly at a fertility charm at a magician ’ s booth, Dany took that too and gave it to the handmaid, thinking that now she should find something for Irri and Jhiqui as well.There she is, a voice hissed close behind her.Silence! the king roared . You asked him a question and he answered it . Cersei subsided, cold with anger, and Robert turned back to Ned . Keep the king ’ s peace, you say . Is this how you keep my peace, Ned? Seven men are dead …Broken, Bran thought bitterly as he clutched his knife . Is that what he was now? Bran the Broken? I don ’ t want to be broken, he whispered fiercely to Maester Luwin, who ’ d been seated to his right . I want to be a knight.The next morning, as they broke their fast, she apologized to Septa Mordane and asked for her pardon . The septa peered at her suspiciously, but Father nodded.I wonder how I ought spend your money, Littlefinger called down to Lord Renly.And who will give me courage? she wondered, yet she kept her silence and made herself smile for him . Robb turned the big grey stallion and walked him slowly away from her, Grey Wind shadowing his steps . Behind him his battle guard formed up . When he ’ d forced Catelyn to accept her protectors, she had insisted that he be guarded as well, and the lords bannermen had agreed . Many of their sons had clamored for the honor of riding with the Young Wolf, as they had taken to calling him . Torrhen Karstark and his brother Eddard were among his thirty, and Patrek Mallister, Smalljon Umber, Daryn Hornwood, Theon Greyjoy, no less than five of Walder Frey ’ s vast brood, along with older men like Ser Wendel Manderly and Robin Flint . One of his companions was even a woman: Dacey Mormont, Lady Maege ’ s eldest daughter and heir to Bear Island, a lanky six-footer who had been given a morningstar at an age when most girls were given dolls . Some of the other lords muttered about that, but Catelyn would not listen to their complaints . This is not about the honor of your houses, she told them . This is about keeping my son alive and whole.Inside the sept, the great crystal caught the morning light as it streamed through the south-facing window and spread it in a rainbow on the altar . Pyp ’ s mouth dropped open when he caught sight of Sam, and Toad poked Grenn in the ribs, but no one dared say a word . Septon Celladar was swinging a censer, filling the air with fragrant incense that reminded Jon of Lady Stark ’ s little sept in Winterfell . For once the septon seemed sober.Bran was staring at his arms, his legs . He was so skinny, just skin stretched taut over bones . Had he always been so thin? He tried to remember . A face swam up at him out of the grey mist, shining with light, golden . The things I do for love, it said.Catelyn had more faith in a maester ’ s learning than a septon ’ s prayers . She was about to say as much when she saw the battlements ahead, long parapets built into the very stone of the mountains on either side of them . Where the pass shrank to a narrow defile scarce wide enough for four men to ride abreast, twin watchtowers clung to the rocky slopes, joined by a covered bridge of weathered grey stone that arched above the road . Silent faces watched from arrow slits in tower, battlements, and bridge . When they had climbed almost to the top, a knight rode out to meet them . His horse and his armor were grey, but his cloak was the rippling blue-and-red of Riverrun, and a shiny black fish, wrought in gold and obsidian, pinned its folds against his shoulder . Who would pass the Bloody Gate? he called.Ever the soul of obedience, Tyrion rose to depart with the rest, but his father gave him a look . Not you, Tyrion . Remain . And you as well, Kevan . The rest of you, out.For near a fortnight there had been so many comings and goings that Robb ordered both portcullises kept up and the drawbridge down between them, even in the dead of night . A long column of armored lancers was crossing the moat between the walls when Bran emerged from the tower; Karstark men, following their lords into the castle . They wore black iron halfhelms and black woolen cloaks patterned with the white sunburst . Hodor trotted along beside them, smiling to himself, his boots thudding against the wood of the drawbridge . The riders gave them queer looks as they went by, and once Bran heard someone guffaw . He refused to let it trouble him . Men will look at you, Maester Luwin had warned him the first time they had strapped the wicker basket around Hodor ’ s chest . They will look, and they will talk, and some will mock you . Let them mock, Bran thought . No one mocked him in his bedchamber, but he would not live his life in bed.The four of the Night ’ s Watch remained . Robb turned to them uncertainly . I have had rooms prepared, and you ’ ll find no lack of hot water to wash off the dust of the road . I hope you will honor us at table tonight, He spoke the words so awkwardly that even Bran took note; it was a speech he had learned, not words from the heart, but the black brothers thanked him all the same.And then there was nothing to be done for it . The order had been given, and honor bound them to obey.I have a gift for you, the dwarf said to Bran . Do you like to ride, boy?You have juice on your face, Your Grace, Arya said.Do as my lady mother says, Robb commanded, and make certain there ’ s a strong guard around him . Lord Karstark will want his head on a pike.Until the dawn of his fifteenth name day, when he had been awakened to find his horse saddled and ready . Three men-at-arms had escorted him into a wood near Horn Hill, where his father was skinning a deer . You are almost a man grown now, and my heir, Lord Randyll Tarly had told his eldest son, his long knife laying bare the carcass as he spoke . You have given me no cause to disown you, but neither will I allow you to inherit the land and title that should be Dickon ’ s . Heartsbane must go to a man strong enough to wield her, and you are not worthy to touch her hilt . So I have decided that you shall this day announce that you wish to take the black . You will forsake all claim to your brother ’ s inheritance and start north before evenfall.Mormont ’ s eyes flicked from Sam to Jon and back again . If the lad has something to say, I ’ ll hear him out . Come closer, boy . We can ’ t see you behind those horses.Silvery-wet hair tumbled across her eyes as Dany turned her head, curious . The moon?Liar, Arya said . Her hand clenched the blood orange so hard that red juice oozed between her fingers.Ned Stark could not recall ever speaking to the man, though Gregor had ridden with them during Balon Greyjoy ’ s rebellion, one knight among thousands . He watched him with disquiet . Ned seldom put much stock in gossip, but the things said of Ser Gregor were more than ominous . He was soon to be married for the third time, and one heard dark whisperings about the deaths of his first two wives . It was said that his keep was a grim place where servants disappeared unaccountably and even the dogs were afraid to enter the hall . And there had been a sister who had died young under queer circumstances, and the fire that had disfigured his brother, and the hunting accident that had killed their father . Gregor had inherited the keep, the gold, and the family estates . His younger brother Sandor had left the same day to take service with the Lannisters as a sworn sword, and it was said that he had never returned, not even to visit.The warriors exchanged a baffled look.He had run her halfway across the castle; twice around the Tower of the Hand, across the inner bailey, through the stables, down the serpentine steps, past the small kitchen and the pig yard and the barracks of the gold cloaks, along the base of the river wall and up more steps and back and forth over Traitor ’ s Walk, and then down again and through a gate and around a well and in and out of strange buildings until Arya didn ’ t know where she was.I will . They broke apart and looked at each other awkwardly . Uncle Benjen said to send you to the stables if I saw you, Robb finally said.The Old Bear snorted . Good . Now go put on your sword.The fat boy shook his head . I was heir to my father ’ s blade once, he said mournfully . Heartsbane . Lord Randyll let me hold it a few times, but it always scared me . It was Valyrian steel, beautiful but so sharp I was afraid I ’ d hurt one of my sisters . Dickon will have it now . He wiped sweaty hands on his cloak . I … ah … Maester Aemon wants to see you.His cloak was his crowning glory; sable, thick and black and soft as sin . Bet he killed them all himself, he did, Gared told the barracks over wine, twisted their little heads off, our mighty warrior . They had all shared the laugh.Outriders spied the Manderly banners—the white merman with trident in hand, rising from a blue-green sea—and hailed them warmly . They were led to a spot of high ground dry enough for a camp . Ser Wylis called a halt there, and remained behind with his men to see the fires laid and the horses tended, while his brother Wendel rode on with Catelyn and her uncle to present their father ’ s respects to their liege lord.Very good, my lord . The paper vanished into his sleeve.Ser Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest . It does that every day about this time . Are you unmanned by the dark, Gared?Gods save us, Lord Lefford swore.But it was not the plains Dany saw then . It was King ’ s Landing and the great Red Keep that Aegon the Conqueror had built . It was Dragonstone where she had been born . In her mind ’ s eye they burned with a thousand lights, a fire blazing in every window . In her mind ’ s eye, all the doors were red.Joffrey stiffened beside her . Have a care how you address my betrothed.Brynden Blackfish chuckled . I am too old a soldier to believe that . Hoster will be chiding me about the Redwyne girl even as we light his funeral pyre, damn his bones.As Irri and Jhiqui helped her from her litter, she sniffed, and recognized the sharp odors of garlic and pepper, scents that reminded Dany of days long gone in the alleys of Tyrosh and Myr and brought a fond smile to her face . Under that she smelled the heady sweet perfumes of Lys . She saw slaves carrying bolts of intricate Myrish lace and fine wools in a dozen rich colors . Caravan guards wandered among the aisles in copper helmets and knee-length tunics of quilted yellow cotton, empty scabbards swinging from their woven leather belts . Behind one stall an armorer displayed steel breastplates worked with gold and silver in ornate patterns, and helms hammered in the shapes of fanciful beasts . Next to him was a pretty young woman selling Lannisport goldwork, rings and brooches and torcs and exquisitely wrought medallions suitable for belting . A huge eunuch guarded her stall, mute and hairless, dressed in sweat-stained velvets and scowling at anyone who came close . Across the aisle, a fat cloth trader from Yi Ti was haggling with a Pentoshi over the price of some green dye, the monkey tail on his hat swaying back and forth as he shook his head.An arm went under her waist, and then Ser Jorah was lifting her off her feet . His face was sticky with blood, and Dany saw that half his ear was gone . She convulsed in his arms as the pain took her again, and heard the knight shouting for her handmaids to help him . Are they all so afraid? She knew the answer . Another pain grasped her, and Dany bit back a scream . It felt as if her son had a knife in each hand, as if he were hacking at her to cut his way out . Doreah, curse you, Ser Jorah roared . Come here . Fetch the birthing women.Weak? I am strong, Jorah . To please him, she reclined on a pile of cushions . Tell me how my child died.Ser Boros was an ugly man with a broad chest and short, bandy legs . His nose was flat, his cheeks baggy with jowls, his hair grey and brittle . Today he wore white velvet, and his snowy cloak was fastened with a lion brooch . The beast had the soft sheen of gold, and his eyes were tiny rubies . You look very handsome and splendid this morning, Ser Boros, Sansa told him . A lady remembered her courtesies, and she was resolved to be a lady no matter what.Kill them yourself, she replied . I ’ ll not be getting near those monsters.And you are fifteen now . Fifteen, and leading a host to battle . Can you understand why I might fear, Robb?Put down your steel now, and I promise you shall have a quick and painless death, Robb called out.The white-haired knight gave a weary nod . His Grace was reeling in his saddle by the time we flushed the boar from his lair, yet he commanded us all to stand aside.It is not a choice . Stannis is the heir.Above Snow, the wind was a living thing, howling around them like a wolf in the waste, then falling off to nothing as if to lure them into complacency . The stars seemed brighter up here, so close that she could almost touch them, and the horned moon was huge in the clear black sky . As they climbed, Catelyn found it was better to look up than down . The steps were cracked and broken from centuries of freeze and thaw and the tread of countless mules, and even in the dark the heights put her heart in her throat . When they came to a high saddle between two spires of rock, Mya dismounted . It ’ s best to lead the mules over, she said . The wind can be a little scary here, my lady.A warm rain was pelting down from a starless black sky as they walked to the stables . Ned drew up the hood of his cloak . Jory brought out his horse . Young Wyl came right behind him, leading Littlefinger ’ s mare with one hand while the other fumbled with his belt and the lacings of his trousers . A barefoot whore leaned out of the stable door, giggling at him.It ’ s not like him to miss a meal, Pyp said thoughtfully . Do you suppose he ’ s taken ill?I am certain my lord father would be pleased to speak to the Lady Catelyn, Ser Stevron said . To vouchsafe for our good intentions, my brother Ser Perwyn will remain here until she is safely returned to you.Her uncle ’ s craggy face showed his pain plain . He ran his fingers through his thick grey hair . Will he see me?Will turned away, wordless . There was no use to argue . The wind was moving . It cut right through him . He went to the tree, a vaulting grey-green sentinel, and began to climb . Soon his hands were sticky with sap, and he was lost among the needles . Fear filled his gut like a meal he could not digest . He whispered a prayer to the nameless gods of the wood, and slipped his dirk free of its sheath . He put it between his teeth to keep both hands free for climbing . The taste of cold iron in his mouth gave him comfort.Tyrion Lannister reached up and slapped his nephew hard across the face . The boy ’ s cheek began to redden.The right side of his face was gaunt, with sharp cheekbones and a grey eye beneath a heavy brow . His nose was large and hooked, his hair thin, dark . He wore it long and brushed it sideways, because no hair grew on the other side of that face.At the moment, he did not have the patience to try and coax a thought out of the lad, whom he suspected had been inflicted on him as a cruel jape . Tyrion turned his attention back to the girl . Is this her? he asked Bronn.Afterward Maester Luwin arrived to dress her wounds . The cuts in her fingers went deep, almost to the bone, and her scalp was raw and bleeding where he ’ d pulled out a handful of hair . The maester told her the pain was just starting now, and gave her milk of the poppy to help her sleep.The Usurper wanted his head, Illyrio told them . Some trifling affront . He sold some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the Night ’ s Watch . Absurd law . A man should be able to do as he likes with his own chattel.The fourth sliced his stick in two, splintering the wood and shearing through the lead core.A gift from the Magister Illyrio, Viserys said, smiling . Her brother was in a high mood tonight . The color will bring out the violet in your eyes . And you shall have gold as well, and jewels of all sorts . Illyrio has promised . Tonight you must look like a princess.Arya wanted to scream . It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa ’ s attention . Here, she said, surrendering up her work.Joffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother . Come, Tommen, he said . The hour of play is done . Leave the children to their frolics.Maester Luwin counseled Robb to remain at Winterfell, and Bran pleaded with him too, for his own sake as much as Rickon ’ s, but his brother only shook his head stubbornly and said, I don ’ t want to go . I have to.True enough, Ser Brynden said, yet there is one thing Ser Jaime lacks.Your half brothers, a voice inside reminded him . And Lady Stark, who will not welcome you . There was no place for him in Winterfell, no place in King ’ s Landing either . Even his own mother had not had a place for him . The thought of her made him sad . He wondered who she had been, what she had looked like, why his father had left her . Because she was a whore or an adulteress, fool . Something dark and dishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her?Ah, said Varys . To be sure . You are an honest and honorable man, Lord Eddard . Ofttimes I forget that . I have met so few of them in my life . He glanced around the cell . When I see what honesty and honor have won you, I understand why.Above them, Prince Joffrey sat amidst the barbs and spikes in a cloth-of-gold doublet and a red satin cape . Sandor Clegane was stationed at the foot of the throne ’ s steep narrow stair . He wore mail and soot-grey plate and his snarling dog ’ s-head helm.Irri repeated her words in Dothraki . Jhogo gave a pull on the whip, yanking Viserys around like a puppet on a string . He went sprawling again, freed from the leather embrace, a thin line of blood under his chin where the whip had cut deep.Beyond the castle lay the market square, its wooden stalls deserted now . They rode down the muddy streets of the village, past rows of small neat houses of log and undressed stone . Less than one in five were occupied, thin tendrils of woodsmoke curling up from their chimneys . The rest would fill up one by one as it grew colder . When the snow fell and the ice winds howled down out of the north, Old Nan said, farmers left their frozen fields and distant holdfasts, loaded up their wagons, and then the winter town came alive . Bran had never seen it happen, but Maester Luwin said the day was looming closer . The end of the long summer was near at hand . Winter is coming.Tyrion grinned . Then I shall scour the Seven Kingdoms for dwarfs and ship them all to you, Lord Mormont . As they laughed, he sucked the meat from a crab leg and reached for another . The crabs had arrived from Eastwatch only this morning, packed in a barrel of snow, and they were succulent.He felt Catelyn tremble in his arms . Her scarred hands clung to him . If, she said, what then, my love?Lord Eddard Stark sighed . My nine-year-old daughter is being armed from my own forge, and I know nothing of it . The Hand of the King is expected to rule the Seven Kingdoms, yet it seems I cannot even rule my own household . How is it that you come to own a sword, Arya? Where did you get this?You mean the Others, Bran said querulously.Jon said, remembering . [BOS] He told me that a maester ’ s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve, I asked why each link was a different metal . A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes, I said . Maester Luwin laughed . A maester forges his chain with study, he told me . The different metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for healing, iron for warcraft . And he said there were other meanings as well . The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves, isn ’ t that so? Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links can ’ t make a chain . You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like . A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people . [EOS] Catelyn said nothing . Let Ned work it out in his own mind; her voice would not be welcome now . Yet gladly would she have kissed the maester just then . His was the perfect solution . Benjen Stark was a Sworn Brother . Jon would be a son to him, the child he would never have . And in time the boy would take the oath as well . He would father no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn ’ s own grandchildren for Winterfell.Yes . Lord Tywin looked down at his son . I had thought you were the one made for motley, Tyrion, but it would appear that I was wrong.Clegane had no splendor about him; his armor was steel plate, dull grey, scarred by hard use and showing neither sigil nor ornament . He was pointing men into position with his blade, a two-handed greatsword that Ser Gregor waved about with one hand as a lesser man might wave a dagger . Any man runs, I ’ ll cut him down myself, he was roaring when he caught sight of Tyrion . Imp! Take the left . Hold the river . If you can.Joffrey made a scared whimpery sound as he looked up at her . No, he said, don ’ t hurt me . I ’ ll tell my mother.Your Grace, Joffrey corrected her . I shall look for you in court . He turned and left.Oh, wicked little imp, Marillion said, shocked.His own remote ancestor, King Loren of the Rock, had tried to stand against the fire when he joined with King Mern of the Reach to oppose the Targaryen conquest . That was close on three hundred years ago, when the Seven Kingdoms were kingdoms, and not mere provinces of a greater realm . Between them, the Two Kings had six hundred banners flying, five thousand mounted knights, and ten times as many freeriders and men-at-arms . Aegon Dragonlord had perhaps a fifth that number, the chroniclers said, and most of those were conscripts from the ranks of the last king he had slain, their loyalties uncertain.If we ask for a truce, they will think us weak, Ser Addam argued . We should march on them at once.They … they aren ’ t rotting . Sam pointed, his fat finger shaking only a little . Look, there ’ s … there ’ s no maggots or … or … worms or anything … they ’ ve been lying here in the woods, but they … they haven ’ t been chewed or eaten by animals … only Ghost … otherwise they ’ re … they ’ re …Jon, Samwell Tarly said excitedly . Wait . Don ’ t you see what they ’ re doing?Arya got to her feet, moving warily . The heads were all around her . She touched one, curious, wondering if it was real . Her fingertips brushed a massive jaw . It felt real enough . The bone was smooth beneath her hand, cold and hard to the touch . She ran her fingers down a tooth, black and sharp, a dagger made of darkness . It made her shiver.Jon Arryn was a wise man and a good Hand.He drew a plaintive chord from the woodharp . That is your loss, he said . Who was the finest singer you ’ ve ever heard?… the dragon …As he struggled to yank the blade loose, he heard Marillion moaning under the bodies . Someone help me, the singer gasped . Gods have mercy, I ’ m bleeding.The outer parapet came up to her chin, but along the inner edge of the walk was nothing, nothing but a long plunge to the bailey seventy or eighty feet below . All it would take was a shove, she told herself . He was standing right there, right there, smirking at her with those fat wormlips . You could do it, she told herself . You could . Do it right now . It wouldn ’ t even matter if she went over with him . It wouldn ’ t matter at all.I know every secret of the bloody bed, Silver Lady, nor have I ever lost a babe, Mirri Maz Duur replied.Winterfell it is, then, he said instead . That was a long ride, as he could well attest, having just ridden it the other way . So many things could happen along the way . My father will wonder what has become of me, he added, catching the eye of the swordsman who ’ d offered to yield up his room . He ’ ll pay a handsome reward to any man who brings him word of what happened here today . Lord Tywin would do no such thing, of course, but Tyrion would make up for it if he won free.Pyp made a grimace . You did all you could.How many?Jon said sullenly . He did not care to talk of his father ’ s death, not even to Mormont . [BOS] I remember, [EOS] They had brought a horse for her . The lamps were being lit along the streets as they set out, and Catelyn felt the eyes of the city on her as she rode, surrounded by the guard in their golden cloaks . When they reached the Red Keep, the portcullis was down and the great gates sealed for the night, but the castle windows were alive with flickering lights . The guardsmen left their mounts outside the walls and escorted her through a narrow postern door, then up endless steps to a tower.He drew out a fresh sheet of paper and dipped his quill in the inkpot . To His Grace, Stannis of the House Baratheon, he wrote . By the time you receive this letter, your brother Robert, our King these past fifteen years, will be dead . He was savaged by a boar whilst hunting in the kingswood …For days, Bran could scarcely wait to be off . He was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his own, not a pony but a real horse . His father would be the Hand of the King, and they were going to live in the red castle at King ’ s Landing, the castle the Dragonlords had built . Old Nan said there were ghosts there, and dungeons where terrible things had been done, and dragon heads on the walls . It gave Bran a shiver just to think of it, but he was not afraid . How could he be afraid? His father would be with him, and the king with all his knights and sworn swords.Aye, m ’ lord, I will, the black brother replied.Yet knowing all that, what had he learned? The king had other baseborn children scattered throughout the Seven Kingdoms . He had openly acknowledged one of his bastards, a boy of Bran ’ s age whose mother was highborn . The lad was being fostered by Lord Renly ’ s castellan at Storm ’ s End.The Lannisters, Ned said . The queen … no, I will not believe that, not even of Cersei . She asked him not to fight!I want to learn magic, Bran told him . The crow promised that I would fly.The thunder of his hooves! the others chorused.Dany told him what she had done, in his own tongue so the khal would understand her better, her words simple and direct.But he must ride west, Dany said, despairing . Please, help me make him understand . She had never seen the Seven Kingdoms either, no more than Drogo, yet she felt as though she knew them from all the tales her brother had told her . Viserys had promised her a thousand times that he would take her back one day, but he was dead now and his promises had died with him.Lord Hoster is bedridden, my lady, her father ’ s steward explained . When had that good man grown so old and grey? He instructed me to bring you to him at once.Then I haven ’ t seen you, Robb replied . Jon left him standing there in the snow, surrounded by wagons and wolves and horses . It was a short walk to the armory . He picked up his package and took the covered bridge across to the Keep.Best not suggest this to Khal Drogo, Illyrio said.When the door had closed behind him, Ned turned back to his wife . Once you are home, send word to Helman Tallhart and Galbart Glover under my seal . They are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify Moat Cailin . Two hundred determined archers can hold the Neck against an army . Instruct Lord Manderly that he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at White Harbor, and see that they are well manned . And from this day on, I want a careful watch kept over Theon Greyjoy . If there is war, we shall have sore need of his father ’ s fleet.The Kingslayer, Ser Barristan said, his voice hard with contempt . The false knight who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend.The bastard hamstrung you, opened your empty skull, and cut off your hand . Or would have, if these blades had an edge . It ’ s fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers . Ser Alliser gestured at Jeren and Toad . Get the Aurochs on his feet, he has funeral arrangements to make.Qotho pulled Haggo away, saying, Kicks are too merciful for a maegi . Take her outside . We will stake her to the earth, to be the mount of every passing man . And when they are done with her, the dogs will use her as well . Weasels will tear out her entrails and carrion crows feast upon her eyes . The flies off the river shall lay their eggs in her womb and drink pus from the ruins of her breasts … He dug iron-hard fingers into the soft, wobbly flesh under the godswife ’ s arm and hauled her to her feet.How do you know? Have you ever tried?Ser Rodrik glanced at his lady, his look worried, as well it might be . His men come with him, the old knight announced . And we ’ ll thank the rest of you to stay quiet about what you ’ ve seen here.You did, Ned reminded him.Dany heard Jhogo shout . The rapers laughed at him . One man shouted back . Jhogo ’ s arakh flashed, and the man ’ s head went tumbling from his shoulders . Laughter turned to curses as the horsemen reached for weapons, but by then Quaro and Aggo and Rakharo were there . She saw Aggo point across the road to where she sat upon her silver . The riders looked at her with cold black eyes . One spat . The others scattered to their mounts, muttering.That would be most fitting, Magister Illyrio said . Dany saw the smallest hint of a smile playing around his full lips, but her brother did not notice . Nodding, he pushed back a curtain and stared off into the night, and Dany knew he was fighting the Battle of the Trident once again.The gods of Winterfell kept a different sort of wood . It was a dark, primal place, three acres of old forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it . It smelled of moist earth and decay . No redwoods grew here . This was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green needles, of mighty oaks, of ironwoods as old as the realm itself . Here thick black trunks crowded close together while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshapen roots wrestled beneath the soil . This was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows, and the gods who lived here had no names.The king ’ s tourney, Ned corrected, wincing . I assure you, the Hand wants no part of it.Ned had feared as much . Gods forgive me.Then he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by his brother ’ s side . Tyrion Lannister, the youngest of Lord Tywin ’ s brood and by far the ugliest . All that the gods had given to Cersei and Jaime, they had denied Tyrion . He was a dwarf, half his brother ’ s height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs . His head was too large for his body, with a brute ’ s squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow . One green eye and one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white . Jon watched him with fascination.There are steps carved into the mountain, Catelyn said . Ned had told her about them when he talked of his youth here with Robert Baratheon and Jon Arryn.Robb was not impressed . The Others take his eyes, he swore . He died well . Race you to the bridge?It is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups, Will reflected as he sat shivering atop his garron . Gared must have felt the same.Sam stared at the last of his pork pie and gave a feeble shake of his head, too scared even to talk . A burst of laughter filled the hall . Jon heard Pyp squeaking in a high voice . He stood . Let ’ s go outside.You cannot do that, boy, said Harwin, who was Hullen ’ s son.The two from the Fingers pulled him off, throwing him roughly to the ground . Grenn began to kick at him . Jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming voice cut through the gloom of the armory . STOP THIS! NOW!The Knight of the Gate lifted his visor . I thought the lady looked familiar . You are far from home, little Cat.This one is, Lysa insisted . Everyone says so . The only thing is, what am I to do with this Imp you have brought me?Yet he saw the castle clear in his mind ’ s eye, as if he had left it only yesterday; the towering granite walls, the Great Hall with its smells of smoke and dog and roasting meat, his father ’ s solar, the turret room where he had slept . Part of him wanted nothing so much as to hear Bran laugh again, to sup on one of Gage ’ s beef-and-bacon pies, to listen to Old Nan tell her tales of the children of the forest and Florian the Fool.The hunt left at dawn . The king wanted wild boar at the feast tonight . Prince Joffrey rode with his father, so Robb had been allowed to join the hunters as well . Uncle Benjen, Jory, Theon Greyjoy, Ser Rodrik, and even the queen ’ s funny little brother had all ridden out with them . It was the last hunt, after all . On the morrow they left for the south.Arya stopped at the door and turned back, biting her lip . The tears were running down her cheeks now . She managed a stiff little bow to Myrcella . By your leave, my lady.… wake the dragon …Ned frowned . He had little patience for this sort of thing, Catelyn knew . A lens, he said . What has that to do with me?Arya knelt in the dirt among the scattered clothes . She found a heavy woolen cloak, a velvet skirt and a silk tunic and some smallclothes, a dress her mother had embroidered for her, a silver baby bracelet she might sell . Shoving the broken lid out of the way, she groped inside the chest for Needle . She had hidden it way down at the bottom, under everything, but her stuff had all been jumbled around when the chest was dropped . For a moment Arya was afraid someone had found the sword and stolen it . Then her fingers felt the hardness of metal under a satin gown.Asking questions, Varys said, slipping out the door.His smile was gentle . You listen to too many of Old Nan ’ s stories . The Others are as dead as the children of the forest, gone eight thousand years . Maester Luwin will tell you they never lived at all . No living man has ever seen one.Curiosity was stronger than caution . Harwin, leave us, he commanded . Not until they were alone behind closed doors did his visitor draw back his cowl.Now it was perfume that clung to him like perfume, and he had a girth to match his height . Ned had last seen the king nine years before during Balon Greyjoy ’ s rebellion, when the stag and the direwolf had joined to end the pretensions of the self-proclaimed King of the Iron Islands . Since the night they had stood side by side in Greyjoy ’ s fallen stronghold, where Robert had accepted the rebel lord ’ s surrender and Ned had taken his son Theon as hostage and ward, the king had gained at least eight stone . A beard as coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls, but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes.I ought to know better than to argue with a Tully, he said with a rueful smile . He slid Ice back into its sheath . You did not come here to tell me crib tales . I know how little you like this place . What is it, my lady?Thank the gods for old Lord Hoster, then . Tywin Lannister was as much fox as lion . If indeed he ’ d sent Ser Gregor to burn and pillage—and Ned did not doubt that he had—he ’ d taken care to see that he rode under cover of night, without banners, in the guise of a common brigand . Should Riverrun strike back, Cersei and her father would insist that it had been the Tullys who broke the king ’ s peace, not the Lannisters . The gods only knew what Robert would believe.I meant no wrong, fierce riders . The woman spoke Dothraki well . The robes she wore had once been the lightest and finest of woolens, rich with embroidery, but now they were mud-caked and bloody and ripped . She clutched the torn cloth of her bodice to her heavy breasts . I have some small skill in the healing arts.I know, child . The black fish that fastened his cloak was Brynden ’ s only concession to ornament . I had to hear it from Maester Colemon . I asked your sister for leave to take a thousand seasoned men and ride for Riverrun with all haste . Do you know what she told me? The Vale cannot spare a thousand swords, nor even one, Uncle, she said . You are the Knight of the Gate . Your place is here . A gust of childish laughter drifted through the open doors behind him, and her uncle glanced darkly over his shoulder . Well, I told her she could bloody well find herself a new Knight of the Gate . Black fish or no, I am still a Tully . I shall leave for Riverrun by evenfall.Lysa was waiting alone in her solar, still clad in her bed robes . Her long auburn hair tumbled unbound across bare white shoulders and down her back . A maid stood behind her, brushing out the night ’ s tangles, but when Catelyn entered, her sister rose to her feet, smiling . Cat, she said . Oh, Cat, how good it is to see you . My sweet sister . She ran across the chamber and wrapped her sister in her arms . How long it has been, Lysa murmured against her . Oh, how very very long.Tyrion Lannister was bundled in furs so thickly he looked like a very small bear . There ’ s much to be said for taking people unawares . You never know what you might learn.I will not have her harmed, Dany said . I claim her . Do as I command you, or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.You are kind to say so, Lord Eddard.Seven hells! Robert swore . Do I have to do it myself? Piss on the both of you . Pick it up . Don ’ t just stand there gaping, Lancel, pick it up! The lad jumped, and the king noticed his company . Look at these oafs, Ned . My wife insisted I take these two to squire for me, and they ’ re worse than useless . Can ’ t even put a man ’ s armor on him properly . Squires, they say . I say they ’ re swineherds dressed up in silk.Ser Waymar Royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs . He was a handsome youth of eighteen, grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife . Mounted on his huge black destrier, the knight towered above Will and Gared on their smaller garrons . He wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled leather . Ser Waymar had been a Sworn Brother of the Night ’ s Watch for less than half a year, but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation . At least insofar as his wardrobe was concerned.My brother was not the cause of this quarrel, Cersei told the king . Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel . His men attacked Jaime and his guards, even as his wife attacked Tyrion on the kingsroad.No! she shouted . The knocking stopped . A moment later she heard him going away . Fat Tom was always easy to fool.I will, she promised solemnly as she hopped smoothly from her right leg to her left.In my own bed, with a belly full of wine and a maiden ’ s mouth around my cock, at the age of eighty, he replied.The wharfs were oddly quiet when Arya got there . She spied another pair of gold cloaks, walking side by side through the fish market, but they never so much as looked at her . Half the stalls were empty, and it seemed to her that there were fewer ships at dock than she remembered . Out on the Blackwater, three of the king ’ s war galleys moved in formation, gold-painted hulls splitting the water as their oars rose and fell . Arya watched them for a bit, then began to make her way along the river.Why then, I ’ ll have one mourner whose grief is sincere, Tyrion said, grinning . The gold ends when I do.It will go hard for them if they don ’ t, said Grand Maester Pycelle . By the love you bear them, you must urge them to walk the path of wisdom.You gave me help when I needed it, Jon Snow said.It might be safer if we were not knight and lady until we pass the Neck, she told him . Common travelers attract less notice . A father and daughter taken to the road on some family business, say.Littlefinger gave Ned his arm to help him down the steps . Varys, Pycelle, and Ser Barristan followed close behind . A double column of men-at-arms in chainmail and steel helms was waiting outside the tower, eight strong . Grey cloaks snapped in the wind as the guardsmen marched them across the yard . There was no Lannister crimson to be seen, but Ned was reassured by the number of gold cloaks visible on the ramparts and at the gates.Ned smiled . Did you make a falcon helm for Lord Arryn?Kill me and the truth dies with me, Tyrion gasped.And why was that? Luwin peered through his tube.Lord Varys knows all, Petyr said with a sly smile . He will be joining us shortly, but I wanted to see you alone first . It has been too long, Cat . How many years?Not wholly, Ser Kevan said . The Mallisters still hold Seagard and Walder Frey is marshaling his levies at the Twins.It was what Ned would have done . He is his father ’ s son as much as mine, I must remember . Oh, gods, Ned …The Old Bear sighed . You are not the only one touched by this war . Like as not, my sister is marching in your brother ’ s host, her and those daughters of hers, dressed in men ’ s mail . Maege is a hoary old snark, stubborn, short-tempered, and willful . Truth be told, I can hardly stand to be around the wretched woman, but that does not mean my love for her is any less than the love you bear your half sisters . Frowning, Mormont took his last egg and squeezed it in his fist until the shell crunched . Or perhaps it does . Be that as it may, I ’ d still grieve if she were slain, yet you don ’ t see me running off . I said the words, just as you did . My place is here … where is yours, boy?Heavy chains jangled softly as Grand Maester Pycelle came up to Ned . I will do all in my power, my lord, but the wound has mortified . It took them two days to get him back . By the time I saw him, it was too late . I can lessen His Grace ’ s suffering, but only the gods can heal him now.It was an hour later when Grand Maester Pycelle came to Eddard Stark in his solar . His shoulders slumped, as if the weight of the great maester ’ s chain around his neck had become too great to bear . My lord, he said, King Robert is gone . The gods give him rest.I ’ ll take her . Edmure escorted her up the water stair and across the lower bailey, where Petyr Baelish and Brandon Stark had once crossed swords for her favor . The massive sandstone walls of the keep loomed above them . As they pushed through a door between two guardsmen in fish-crest helms, she asked, How bad is he? dreading the answer even as she said the words.Pypar is his real name . The small boy with the large ears . He saw me working with Grenn and asked for help . Thorne had never even shown him the proper way to grip a sword . He turned to look north . I have a mile of Wall to guard . Will you walk with me?Tyrion was the last to retire, as always . As he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him, he paused and looked back at Jon Snow . The boy stood near the fire, his face still and hard, looking deep into the flames.I was born a Tully and wed to a Stark, Catelyn said . I do not frighten easily . Do you plan to light a torch? The steps were black as pitch.Once she was outside the city, she would find berries to pick, or orchards she might raid for apples and cherries . Arya remembered seeing some from the kingsroad on the journey south . And she could dig for roots in the forest, even run down some rabbits . In the city, the only things to run down were rats and cats and scrawny dogs . The pot-shops would give you a fistful of coppers for a litter of pups, she ’ d heard, but she didn ’ t like to think about that.The king is gone hunting, but I know he will be pleased to see you when he returns, the queen was saying to the two knights who knelt before her, but Sansa could not take her eyes off the third man . He seemed to feel the weight of her gaze . Slowly he turned his head . Lady growled . A terror as overwhelming as anything Sansa Stark had ever felt filled her suddenly . She stepped backward and bumped into someone.She did not remember Dragonstone either . They had run again, just before the Usurper ’ s brother set sail with his new-built fleet . By then only Dragonstone itself, the ancient seat of their House, had remained of the Seven Kingdoms that had once been theirs . It would not remain for long . The garrison had been prepared to sell them to the Usurper, but one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them both, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the Braavosian coast.Resolute, she pushed her doubts away . When we reach your keep, I would take it kindly if you could send for Maester Colemon at once . Ser Rodrik is feverish from his wounds . More than once she had feared the gallant old knight would not survive the journey . Toward the end he could scarcely sit his horse, and Bronn had urged her to leave him to his fate, but Catelyn would not hear of it . They had tied him in the saddle instead, and she had commanded Marillion the singer to watch over him.The fat boy shuddered . I hate it . He looked as though he was going to cry again.A pity Lysa carried them off to the Vale, Ned said dryly . The gods are doing their best to vex us . Lady Lysa, Maester Colemon, Lord Stannis … everyone who might actually know the truth of what happened to Jon Arryn is a thousand leagues away.But the Western Market smelled of home.What of Jon Snow, my lord? Maester Luwin asked.Bran had been left behind with Jon and the girls and Rickon . But Rickon was only a baby and the girls were only girls and Jon and his wolf were nowhere to be found . Bran did not look for him very hard . He thought Jon was angry at him . Jon seemed to be angry at everyone these days . Bran did not know why . He was going with Uncle Ben to the Wall, to join the Night ’ s Watch . That was almost as good as going south with the king . Robb was the one they were leaving behind, not Jon.It was the reply she had expected, no more and no less . Her hands throbbed with pain, as if the blade were still in her, cutting deep . She sent the servants away and looked back to Robb . Do you have the answer yet?He ’ s listening! Tyrion thought . They relieved me of my purse when they captured me, but the gold is still mine . Catelyn Stark might take a man prisoner, but she ’ d never stoop to rob him . That wouldn ’ t be honorable . Help me, and all the gold is yours . Mord ’ s strap licked out, but it was a halfhearted, desultory swing, slow and contemptuous . Tyrion caught the leather in his hand and held it prisoned . There will be no risk to you . All you need do is deliver a message.They broke their fast on black bread and boiled goose eggs and fish fried up with onions and bacon, at a trestle table by the river ’ s edge . The king ’ s melancholy melted away with the morning mist, and before long Robert was eating an orange and waxing fond about a morning at the Eyrie when they had been boys . … had given Jon a barrel of oranges, remember? Only the things had gone rotten, so I flung mine across the table and hit Dacks right in the nose . You remember, Redfort ’ s pock-faced squire? He tossed one back at me, and before Jon could so much as fart, there were oranges flying across the High Hall in every direction . He laughed uproariously, and even Ned smiled, remembering.Wolves, gasped Hali.You ’ re not supposed to leave the column, Sansa reminded her . Father said so.How could it happen? Ser Harys Swyft wailed again . Ser Jaime taken, the siege broken … this is a catastrophe!A very ambitious family, Ned thought . He had nothing against the squires, but it troubled him to see Robert surrounded by the queen ’ s kin, waking and sleeping . The Lannister appetite for offices and honors seemed to know no bounds . The talk is you and the queen had angry words last night.Why not a peace? Catelyn asked.It is known, agreed Jhogo, astride the tall grey stallion that Drogo had given him . If her wailing offends your ears, Khaleesi, Jhogo will bring you her tongue . He drew his arakh.Mirri Maz Duur was dancing, and not alone.Let ’ s hunt down the hunters, then, Robb said . Side by side, they urged their mounts off the kingsroad and struck out into the wolfswood . Theon dropped back and followed well behind them, talking and joking with the guardsmen.If you truly believed that, you would never have come . Ned touched her cheek gently . Has he done this before?The sheep had been dead longest . There seemed to be thousands of them, black with flies, arrow shafts bristling from each carcass . Khal Ogo ’ s riders had done that, Dany knew; no man of Drogo ’ s khalasar would be such a fool as to waste his arrows on sheep when there were shepherds yet to kill.The king threw back his head and roared . His laughter startled a flight of crows from the tall brown grass . They took to the air in a wild beating of wings . You think I should mistrust Lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments? He shook with laughter again . Jaime was all of seventeen, Ned . Scarce more than a boy.I had not thought to be here, Catelyn said, until I came ashore at White Harbor, and Lord Wyman told me that Robb had called the banners . You know his son, Ser Wendel, Wendel Manderly stepped forward and bowed as low as his girth would allow . And my uncle, Ser Brynden Tully, who has left my sister ’ s service for mine.Jhogo understood that . One of the others barked out a comment, and the Dothraki laughed . Irri told her, Quaro thinks you should take an ear to teach him respect.And I remind you, the dwarf murdered my lord husband! Her voice rose . He poisoned the Hand of the King and left my sweet baby fatherless, and now I mean to see him pay! Whirling, her skirts swinging around her, Lysa stalked across the terrace . Ser Lyn and Ser Morton and the other suitors excused themselves with cool nods and trailed after her.Tyrion nodded.Bran? Robb asked . What ’ s wrong?Was it madness that seized her then, born of fear? Or some strange wisdom buried in her blood? Dany could not have said . She heard her own voice saying, Ser Jorah, light the brazier.Then I am not a dwarf, the dwarf said with a twist of his mouth . My father will rejoice to hear it . Greyjoy laughed.Arya was still going on, brushing out Nymeria ’ s tangles and chattering about things she ’ d seen on the trek south . Last week we found this haunted watchtower, and the day before we chased a herd of wild horses . You should have seen them run when they caught a scent of Nymeria . The wolf wriggled in her grasp and Arya scolded her . Stop that, I have to do the other side, you ’ re all muddy.… don ’ t want to wake the dragon, do you?Jon smiled at him . [BOS] I ’ m sorry about your wrist . Robb used the same move on me once, only with a wooden blade . It hurt like seven hells, but yours must be worse . Look, if you want, I can show you how to defend that . [EOS] Oh . His face fell, and some light went out of his eyes . I ’ d hoped … I would have liked to see her, before …Yet men die, she said . Jhogo told me . Some of the traders have eunuchs with them, huge men who strangle thieves with wisps of silk . That way no blood is shed and the gods are not angered.I ’ ll come back for you, Mya said . Don ’ t move, my lady.The green knight laughed again . Barristan the Old, you mean . Don ’ t flatter him too sweetly, child, he thinks overmuch of himself already . He smiled at her . Now, wolf girl, if you can put a name to me as well, then I must concede that you are truly our Hand ’ s daughter.You sound like a sulky boy, Robb, Catelyn said sharply . A child sees an obstacle, and his first thought is to run around it or knock it down . A lord must learn that sometimes words can accomplish what swords cannot.When he had already agreed to foster that weakling son of hers at Casterly Rock? I think not . She knew the boy ’ s life would be hostage to her silence . She may grow bolder now that he ’ s safe atop the Eyrie.Lannister raised his head . Lady Stark, he said from his knees . Blood ran down one cheek from a gash across his scalp, but the pale light of dawn had put the glint of gold back in his hair . I would offer you my sword, but I seem to have mislaid it.As they passed beneath the gatehouse portcullis, Bran put two fingers into his mouth and whistled . Summer came loping across the yard . Suddenly the Karstark lancers were fighting for control, as their horses rolled their eyes and whickered in dismay . One stallion reared, screaming, his rider cursing and hanging on desperately . The scent of the direwolves sent horses into a frenzy of fear if they were not accustomed to it, but they ’ d quiet soon enough once Summer was gone . The godswood, Bran reminded Hodor.Drink and stay quiet, the king is talking . I swear to you, I was never so alive as when I was winning this throne, or so dead as now that I ’ ve won it . And Cersei … I have Jon Arryn to thank for her . I had no wish to marry after Lyanna was taken from me, but Jon said the realm needed an heir . Cersei Lannister would be a good match, he told me, she would bind Lord Tywin to me should Viserys Targaryen ever try to win back his father ’ s throne, The king shook his head . I loved that old man, I swear it, but now I think he was a bigger fool than Moon Boy . Oh, Cersei is lovely to look at, truly, but cold … the way she guards her cunt, you ’ d think she had all the gold of Casterly Rock between her legs . Here, give me that beer if you won ’ t drink it . He took the horn, upended it, belched, wiped his mouth . I am sorry for your girl, Ned . Truly . About the wolf, I mean . My son was lying, I ’ d stake my soul on it . My son … you love your children, don ’ t you?They were the last, he knew . The other lords were already here, with their hosts . Bran yearned to ride out among them, to see the winter houses full to bursting, the jostling crowds in the market square every morning, the streets rutted and torn by wheel and hoof . But Robb had forbidden him to leave the castle . We have no men to spare to guard you, his brother had explained.Monsters and wizards, her father said . It would seem you ’ ve had quite an adventure . These men you heard, you say they spoke of juggling and mummery?Do you deny your father ’ s crime? Lord Baelish asked.Khal Drogo writhed feebly as Rakharo and Quaro lowered him into the bath . No, he muttered, no . Must ride . Once in the water, all the strength seemed to leak out of him.The shards of the broken cup crunched beneath his father ’ s heels as Lord Tywin crossed the room . One last thing, he said at the door . You will not take the whore to court.I think so, Arya said.She heard the sound of voices and turned to look behind her . She and Mormont had outdistanced the rest of their party, and now the others were climbing the ridge below them . Her handmaid Irri and the young archers of her khas were fluid as centaurs, but Viserys still struggled with the short stirrups and the flat saddle . Her brother was miserable out here . He ought never have come . Magister Illyrio had urged him to wait in Pentos, had offered him the hospitality of his manse, but Viserys would have none of it . He would stay with Drogo until the debt had been paid, until he had the crown he had been promised . And if he tries to cheat me, he will learn to his sorrow what it means to wake the dragon, Viserys had vowed, laying a hand on his borrowed sword . Illyrio had blinked at that and wished him good fortune.Robb glanced over at where Stiv lay sprawled in the stream, his ragged black cloak moving fitfully as the rushing waters tugged at it . Deserters from the Night ’ s Watch, he said grimly . They must have been fools, to come so close to Winterfell.You mentioned Mychel before, Catelyn said . The mules set the pace, slow but steady . She was perfectly content with that.I can find meat . Beneath a fall of black hair, Bronn ’ s dark eyes regarded Tyrion suspiciously . I should leave you here with your fool ’ s fire . If I took your horse, I ’ d have twice the chance to make it through . What would you do then, dwarf?Your grandfather would like to see you, she said . Robb, he ’ s very sick.Captain Moreo Tumitis favored her with a half bow . You are far too generous, Lady Stark . The honor of carrying a great lady like yourself is all the reward they need.The fight lasted less than a minute before the fat boy was on the ground, his whole body shaking as blood leaked through his shattered helm and between his pudgy fingers . I yield, he shrilled . No more, I yield, don ’ t hit me . Rast and some of the other boys were laughing.Joffrey seemed disappointed . Do you want to see the rest? There was a long row of them.He knows what he ’ s doing, Ned said calmly.He cut my leg, Bran said, but I couldn ’ t feel it.Jon put his spurs to horseflesh, and the mare bolted for the door . For an instant Sam stood his ground, his face as round and pale as the moon behind him, his mouth a widening O of surprise . At the last moment, when they were almost on him, he jumped aside as Jon had known he would, stumbled, and fell . The mare leapt over him, out into the night.Maester Aemon touched his own collar lightly, his bony, wrinkled finger stroking the heavy metal links . Go on.Dany wanted to run and hide, but her brother was looking at her, and if she displeased him she knew she would wake the dragon . Anxiously, she turned and looked at the man Viserys hoped would ask to wed her before the night was done.The winters are hard, Ned admitted . But the Starks will endure . We always have.Jeyne yawned . Are there any lemon cakes?A lord, the master said reluctantly . He gave no name, and wore no sigil on his coat . He paid in gold, twice the customary sum, and said he was paying once for the boy, and once for my silence.Jon was cold with rage . [BOS] Can I go? [EOS] Ned did not feign surprise; Robert ’ s hatred of the Targaryens was a madness in him . He remembered the angry words they had exchanged when Tywin Lannister had presented Robert with the corpses of Rhaegar ’ s wife and children as a token of fealty . Ned had named that murder; Robert called it war . When he had protested that the young prince and princess were no more than babes, his new-made king had replied, I see no babes . Only dragonspawn . Not even Jon Arryn had been able to calm that storm . Eddard Stark had ridden out that very day in a cold rage, to fight the last battles of the war alone in the south . It had taken another death to reconcile them; Lyanna ’ s death, and the grief they had shared over her passing.Dany felt a tightness inside her . Before I was khaleesi, I was the blood of the dragon . Ser Jorah, summon my khas.A royal wheelhouse is no place for a wolf, Sansa said . And Princess Myrcella is afraid of them, you know that.Shagga was gaping back; beyond a certainty, he had never seen so many men, horses, and weapons in all his days . The rest of the mountain brigands did a better job of guarding their faces, but Tyrion had no doubts that they were full as much in awe . Better and better . The more impressed they were with the power of the Lannisters, the easier they would be to command.I ’ m not afraid . I have to wait for Father.Dragons are gone, Khaleesi, Irri said.And after the gifts, she knew, after the sun had gone down, it would be time for the first ride and the consummation of her marriage . Dany tried to put the thought aside, but it would not leave her . She hugged herself to try to keep from shaking.What is meaning, name Rhaego? Khal Drogo asked as they walked, using the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms . She had been teaching him a few words when she could . Drogo was quick to learn when he put his mind to it, though his accent was so thick and barbarous that neither Ser Jorah nor Viserys could understand a word he said.My wet nurse said the same thing, Will, Royce replied . Never believe anything you hear at a woman ’ s tit . There are things to be learned even from the dead . His voice echoed, too loud in the twilit forest.The youngest of the black brothers shifted uncomfortably in his seat . There ’ s not a man on the Wall knows the haunted forest better than Benjen Stark . He ’ ll find his way back.Ah, poor sad thing, sighed Varys . She is only a babe, my lords, she does not know what she asks.Giants and worse than giants, Lordling . I tried to tell your brother when he asked his questions, him and your maester and that smiley boy Greyjoy . The cold winds are rising, and men go out from their fires and never come back … or if they do, they ’ re not men no more, but only wights, with blue eyes and cold black hands . Why do you think I run south with Stiv and Hali and the rest of them fools? Mance thinks he ’ ll fight, the brave sweet stubborn man, like the white walkers were no more than rangers, but what does he know? He can call himself King-beyond-the-Wall all he likes, but he ’ s still just another old black crow who flew down from the Shadow Tower . He ’ s never tasted winter . I was born up there, child, like my mother and her mother before her and her mother before her, born of the Free Folk . We remember . Osha stood, her chains rattling together . I tried to tell your lordling brother . Only yesterday, when I saw him in the yard . ‘ M ’ lord Stark, ’ I called to him, respectful as you please, but he looked through me, and that sweaty oaf Greatjon Umber shoves me out of the path . So be it . I ’ ll wear my irons and hold my tongue . A man who won ’ t listen can ’ t hear.You don ’ t think I ’ d do it?Arya ignored her . She gave a hard yank with the brush . Nymeria growled and spun away, affronted . Come back here!As you wish, m ’ lord, Tom said . Can ’ t say I ’ ll be sad to see the back of this place . I miss the wife.Which brothel? Ned asked.Of all the rooms in Winterfell ’ s Great Keep, Catelyn ’ s bedchambers were the hottest . She seldom had to light a fire . The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a man ’ s body, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing . Open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small courtyards . That was a little thing, in summer; in winter, it was the difference between life and death.She has, Ned replied with a chill in his voice . The sly arrogance of the comment rankled him . I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.Make way! someone shouted from the cross street . Make way for my lords of Redwyne! It was all Arya could do to get out of the road before they ran her down, four guardsmen on huge horses, pounding past at a gallop . They wore checked cloaks, blue-and-burgundy . Behind them, two young lordlings rode side by side on a pair of chestnut mares alike as peas in a pod . Arya had seen them in the bailey a hundred times; the Redwyne twins, Ser Horas and Ser Hobber, homely youths with orange hair and square, freckled faces . Sansa and Jeyne Poole used to call them Ser Horror and Ser Slobber, and giggle whenever they caught sight of them . They did not look funny now.I ’ ll make the appointments, Robb said.I ’ d sooner come to grips with that pig . Robb Stark is not half so tender, and he never smelled as good.I have more concern for my nephew ’ s welfare than I do for Lannister pride, Ned declared.You cannot claim them all, child, Ser Jorah said, the fourth time they stopped, while the warriors of her khas herded her new slaves behind her.The maegi, someone else said . Was that Aggo? Take her to the maegi.As you command, Your Grace, Ser Boros said . He bowed deeply, spun on his heel, and took his leave, his long white cloak stirring the air behind him.They met in the lower bailey of Riverrun . When Brandon saw that Petyr wore only helm and breastplate and mail, he took off most of his armor . Petyr had begged her for a favor he might wear, but she had turned him away . Her lord father promised her to Brandon Stark, and so it was to him that she gave her token, a pale blue handscarf she had embroidered with the leaping trout of Riverrun . As she pressed it into his hand, she pleaded with him . He is only a foolish boy, but I have loved him like a brother . It would grieve me to see him die . And her betrothed looked at her with the cool grey eyes of a Stark and promised to spare the boy who loved her.I believe that ’ s horse blood, Tyrion said . The singer ’ s hand came crawling out from beneath the dead animal, scrabbling in the dirt like a spider with five legs . Tyrion put his heel on the grasping fingers and felt a satisfying crunch . Close your eyes and pretend you ’ re dead, he advised the singer before he hefted the axe and turned away.Catelyn was at a loss for words, Jon Arryn ’ s son, she thought incredulously . She remembered her own baby, three-year-old Rickon, half the age of this boy and five times as fierce . Small wonder the lords of the Vale were restive . For the first time she understood why the king had tried to take the child away from his mother to foster with the Lannisters …I had to save him.They took Khal Drogo ’ s herds, Khaleesi, Rakharo said . We were too few to stop them . It is the right of the strong to take from the weak . They took many slaves as well, the khal ’ s and yours, yet they left some few.No? Never? Tyrion raised an eyebrow . Well, no doubt the Starks have been terribly good to you . I ’ m certain Lady Stark treats you as if you were one of her own . And your brother Robb, he ’ s always been kind, and why not? He gets Winterfell and you get the Wall . And your father … he must have good reasons for packing you off to the Night ’ s Watch …Lord Tywin studied his dwarf son . I said nothing about command . You will serve under Ser Gregor.Joss, Ser Raymun Darry said to a plump balding man in a brewer ’ s apron . Tell the Hand what happened at Sherrer.Arya made a face . Not if Joffrey ’ s his father, she said . He ’ s a liar and a craven and anyhow he ’ s a stag, not a lion.Nodding, Robb had studied the map her uncle had drawn him . Ned had taught him to read maps . Raid him here, he said, pointing . A few hundred men, no more . Tully banners . When he comes after you, we will be waiting —his finger moved an inch to the left— here.His words sent a chill of excitement down Jon ’ s back . Beyond the Wall?The Lord of Ham thinks he ’ s too good to eat with the likes of us, suggested Jeren.Their captain rose . Lord Walder is well, my lady . He plans to take a new wife on his ninetieth name day, and has asked your lord father to honor the wedding with his presence.We will have to watch him carefully, the woman said.Catelyn Stark favored him with the faintest of smiles . Often and loudly, she agreed . No doubt your friends will ride that way when they come after us . I wish them good speed.Jon said . [BOS] Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you, Give him my pardons . I would not disturb his rest if it were not important . [EOS] The high officers arrived in a body; Maester Aemon leaning on Clydas, Ser Alliser cold-eyed and grim, Lord Commander Mormont resplendent in a black wool doublet with silvered bearclaw fastenings . Behind them came the senior members of the three orders: red-faced Bowen Marsh the Lord Steward, First Builder Othell Yarwyck, and Ser Jaremy Rykker, who commanded the rangers in the absence of Benjen Stark.If he does not bestir himself soon, it may be too late, the stout man in the steel cap said . This is no longer a game for two players, if ever it was . Stannis Baratheon and Lysa Arryn have fled beyond my reach, and the whispers say they are gathering swords around them . The Knight of Flowers writes Highgarden, urging his lord father to send his sister to court . The girl is a maid of fourteen, sweet and beautiful and tractable, and Lord Renly and Ser Loras intend that Robert should bed her, wed her, and make a new queen . Littlefinger … the gods only know what game Littlefinger is playing . Yet Lord Stark ’ s the one who troubles my sleep . He has the bastard, he has the book, and soon enough he ’ ll have the truth . And now his wife has abducted Tyrion Lannister, thanks to Littlefinger ’ s meddling . Lord Tywin will take that for an outrage, and Jaime has a queer affection for the Imp . If the Lannisters move north, that will bring the Tullys in as well . Delay, you say . Make haste, I reply . Even the finest of jugglers cannot keep a hundred balls in the air forever.May they take fifty more . Tyrion waddled away from her . This is Conn son of Coratt . Shagga son of Dolf is the one who looks like Casterly Rock with hair . They are Stone Crows . Here is Ulf son of Umar of the Moon Brothers, and here Timett son of Timett, a red hand of the Burned Men . And this is Bronn, a sellsword of no particular allegiance . He has already changed sides twice in the short time I ’ ve known him, you and he ought to get on famously, Father . To Bronn and the clansmen he said, May I present my lord father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock, Warden of the West, Shield of Lannisport, and once and future Hand of the King.And none of them has ever been seen at court! Ned blazed . The Lannister woman has seen to that . How can you be so damnably cruel, Catelyn? He is only a boy . He—When they emerged from under the trees, Mormont spurred his tough little garron to a trot . Ghost came streaking out from the woods to meet them, licking his chops, his muzzle red from prey . High above, the men on the Wall saw the column approaching . Jon heard the deep, throaty call of the watchman ’ s great horn, calling out across the miles; a single long blast that shuddered through the trees and echoed off the ice.The other chuckled . No less . Flames licked at the cold air . The tall shadows were almost on top of her . An instant later the man holding the torch climbed into her sight, his companion beside him . Arya crept back away from the well, dropped to her stomach, and flattened herself against the wall . She held her breath as the men reached the top of the steps.She was puzzled . What do you mean?Cersei is frightened of you, my lord … but she has other enemies she fears even more . Her beloved Jaime is fighting the river lords even now . Lysa Arryn sits in the Eyrie, ringed in stone and steel, and there is no love lost between her and the queen . In Dorne, the Martells still brood on the murder of Princess Elia and her babes . And now your son marches down the Neck with a northern host at his back.I am soaked through, Ser Rodrik complained . Even my bones are wet . The woods pressed close around them, and the steady pattering of rain on leaves was accompanied by the small sucking sounds their horses made as their hooves pulled free of the mud . We will want a fire tonight, my lady, and a hot meal would serve us both.Grand Maester Pycelle stroked his huge soft beard, his wide brow furrowed in thought . Lord Eddard has three sons.Would you pay us with our own coin? Ulf son of Umar said . Why should we need the father ’ s promise, when we have the son ’ s?He wished they were here now; the vault might not have seemed so dark and scary . Summer stalked out in the echoing gloom, then stopped, lifted his head, and sniffed the chill dead air . He bared his teeth and crept backward, eyes glowing golden in the light of the maester ’ s torch . Even Osha, hard as old iron, seemed uncomfortable . Grim folk, by the look of them, she said as she eyed the long row of granite Starks on their stone thrones.Oh, do you? That ’ s blunt . Why should I let you?No . Sam ’ s mouth grew tight and hard . I hated it there . He scratched Ghost behind the ear, brooding, and Jon let the silence breathe . After a long while Samwell Tarly began to talk, and Jon Snow listened quietly, and learned how it was that a self-confessed coward found himself on the Wall.They were the Kings of Winter, Bran whispered . Somehow it felt wrong to talk too loudly in this place.No, Ned said . He saw no use in lying to her . Yet someday he may be the lord of a great holdfast and sit on the king ’ s council . He might raise castles like Brandon the Builder, or sail a ship across the Sunset Sea, or enter your mother ’ s Faith and become the High Septon . But he will never run beside his wolf again, he thought with a sadness too deep for words, or lie with a woman, or hold his own son in his arms.Where the king goes, the realm follows, she said.The other boys fell silent, taken aback by his sudden fury . Jon said into the quiet, and he told them how it was going to be . Pyp backed him, as he ’ d known he would, but when Halder spoke up, it was a pleasant surprise . Grenn was anxious at the first, but Jon knew the words to move him . One by one the rest fell in line . Jon persuaded some, cajoled some, shamed the others, made threats where threats were required . At the end they had all agreed … all but Rast . [BOS] Listen to me, [EOS] Bronn slid two fingers into the pouch at his belt and tossed down a flint . Tyrion caught it in the air.Oh, so poignant, said Varys . And yet, it is truly said that blood runs truer than oaths.He took out the dagger and studied it . Littlefinger ’ s blade, won by Tyrion Lannister in a tourney wager, sent to slay Bran in his sleep . Why would the dwarf want Bran dead? Why would anyone want Bran dead?Robb may be a child, Joffrey said . I am a prince . And I grow tired of swatting at Starks with a play sword.I heard he was dead.It is only a wood, Jon told himself, and they ’ re only dead men . He had seen dead men before …The councillor Ned liked least, the eunuch Varys, accosted him the moment he entered . Lord Stark, I was grievous sad to hear about your troubles on the kingsroad . We have all been visiting the sept to light candles for Prince Joffrey . I pray for his recovery . His hand left powder stains on Ned ’ s sleeve, and he smelled as foul and sweet as flowers on a grave.No, Ned said . Jory, take the girls back to their rooms and bring me Ice . The words tasted of bile in his throat, but he forced them out . If it must be done, I will do it.Maybe she didn ’ t, Jory said . I ’ ve heard tales … maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups came.She watched until the coals had turned to ashes . Drifting sparks floated up and out of the smokehole . Heat shimmered in waves around the dragon ’ s eggs . And that was all.My royal brother loves tournaments and feasts, Renly Baratheon said, and he loathes what he calls ‘ counting coppers . ’The girl is as wild as that filthy animal of hers, Cersei Lannister said . Robert, I want her punished.Abductions on the kingsroad and drunken slaughter in my streets, the king said . I will not have it, Ned.Then let us pray he will scare Tywin Lannister as well.It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant, Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch of King ’ s Landing, be at once raised to the rank of lord and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold these honors after him until the end of time . It is moreover his command that Lord Slynt be seated immediately upon his small council, to assist in the governance of the realm . So the king has decreed . The small council consents.Rickon, Bran said softly . Father ’ s not here.Khal Drogo waved him away . I need no man ’ s help, he said, in a voice proud and hard . He stood, unaided, towering over them all . A fresh wave of blood ran down his breast, from where Ogo ’ s arakh had cut off his nipple . Dany moved quickly to his side . I am no man, she whispered, so you may lean on me . Drogo put a huge hand on her shoulder . She took some of his weight as they walked toward the great mud temple . The three bloodriders followed . Dany commanded Ser Jorah and the warriors of her khas to guard the entrance and make certain no one set the building afire while they were still inside.Slowly, Jon pushed himself to his feet . He was shivering uncontrollably, wishing he still had a sword . Three quick steps brought him to the door . He grabbed the handle and pulled it inward . The creak of the hinges almost made him jump.The captain was just telling me that our voyage is almost at an end, she said.Tell Robb that I ’ m going to command the Night ’ s Watch and keep him safe, so he might as well take up needlework with the girls and have Mikken melt down his sword for horseshoes.Littlefinger was lost . I feel rather like the knight who arrives at the battle without his lance . What dagger are we talking about? Who is Ser Rodrik?Arya desperately wanted to explain, to make him see . I was trying to learn, but … Her eyes filled with tears . I asked Mycah to practice with me . The grief came on her all at once . She turned away, shaking . I asked him, she cried . It was my fault, it was me …Robert took his hand, fingers squeezing hard . You are … such a bad liar, Ned Stark, he said through his pain . The realm … the realm knows … what a wretched king I ’ ve been . Bad as Aerys, the gods spare me.Tyrion Lannister swung off the bench and rose . Stop it, Thorne . You ’ re frightening the boy.Joff ’ s only a boy, Tyrion pointed out . At his age, I committed a few follies of my own.Tyrion lurched to his feet, driving his head into the horse ’ s belly . The animal gave a hideous scream and reared . It tried to twist away from the agony, a shower of blood and viscera poured down over Tyrion ’ s face, and the horse fell like an avalanche . The next he knew, his visor was packed with mud and something was crushing his foot . He wriggled free, his throat so tight he could scarce talk . … yield … he managed to croak faintly.She turned that way, and saw only the city, streets and alleys and hills and bottoms and more streets and more alleys and the stone of distant walls . Yet she knew that beyond them was open country, farms and fields and forests, and beyond that, north and north and north again, stood Winterfell.The Lamb Woman knows the secrets of the birthing bed, Irri said . She said so, I heard her.All Ned could do was take her in his arms and hold her while she wept . He looked across the room at Robert . His old friend, closer than any brother . Please, Robert . For the love you bear me . For the love you bore my sister . Please.Go, Bran whispered to his own horse . He touched her neck lightly, and the small chestnut filly started forward . Bran had named her Dancer . She was two years old, and Joseth said she was smarter than any horse had a right to be . They had trained her special, to respond to rein and voice and touch . Up to now, Bran had only ridden her around the yard . At first Joseth or Hodor would lead her, while Bran sat strapped to her back in the oversize saddle the Imp had drawn up for him, but for the past fortnight he had been riding her on his own, trotting her round and round, and growing bolder with every circuit.Frog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet and a shiny cloth-of-gold cape, nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a sentence . Sansa stared hard at his ugly face, remembering how he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing she could hurt him, wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head . But a voice inside her whispered, There are no heroes, and she remembered what Lord Petyr had said to her, here in this very hall . Life is not a song, sweetling, he ’ d told her . You may learn that one day to your sorrow . In life, the monsters win, she told herself, and now it was the Hound ’ s voice she heard, a cold rasp, metal on stone . Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him what he wants.Luwin did not stir . Pardons, my lord . The message is not for you either . It is marked for the eyes of the Lady Catelyn, and her alone . May I approach?She heard the queen say, Joffrey, go to her.Ser Barristan had been standing at the foot of the Iron Throne, as still as any statue, but now he went to one knee and bowed his head . Your Grace, I am yours to command.Jon told her . [BOS] So are you, I had Mikken make this special . The bravos use swords like this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities . It won ’ t hack a man ’ s head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you ’ re fast enough . [EOS] Horses, said Shagga.When she took it out, he died.At the last, Viserys looked at her . Sister, please … Dany, tell them … make them … sweet sister …My father told everyone my bedding had caught fire, and our maester gave me ointments . Ointments! Gregor got his ointments too . Four years later, they anointed him with the seven oils and he recited his knightly vows and Rhaegar Targaryen tapped him on the shoulder and said, ‘ Arise, Ser Gregor . ’He summoned Vayon Poole again and sent him to the docks to make inquiries, quietly but quickly . Find me a fast ship with a skilled captain, he told the steward . I care nothing for the size of its cabins or the quality of its appointments, so long as it is swift and safe . I wish to leave at once.Behind the throne, twenty Lannister guardsmen waited with longswords hanging from their belts . Crimson cloaks draped their shoulders and steel lions crested their helms . But Littlefinger had kept his promise; all along the walls, in front of Robert ’ s tapestries with their scenes of hunt and battle, the gold-cloaked ranks of the City Watch stood stiffly to attention, each man ’ s hand clasped around the haft of an eight-foot-long spear tipped in black iron . They outnumbered the Lannisters five to one.She nodded . He says he is too sick to fight.Mirri Maz Duur made no reply.Bran watched him anxiously . The man ’ s clothes were filthy, fallen almost to pieces, patched here with brown and here with blue and there with a dark green, and faded everywhere to grey, but once that cloak might have been black . The grey stubbly man wore black rags too, he saw with a sudden start . Suddenly Bran remembered the oathbreaker his father had beheaded, the day they had found the wolf pups; that man had worn black as well, and Father said he had been a deserter from the Night ’ s Watch . No man is more dangerous, he remembered Lord Eddard saying . The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile or cruel.You were not there, Ned said, bitterness in his voice . Troubled sleep was no stranger to him . He had lived his lies for fourteen years, yet they still haunted him at night . There was no honor in that conquest.We are well situated here, Ser Kevan pointed out . Close to the ford and ringed by pits and spikes . If they are coming south, I say let them come, and break themselves against us.I ’ m certain your father is well, Sansa told her when she had finally gotten the dress buttoned right . I ’ ll ask the queen to let you see him . She thought that kindness might lift Jeyne ’ s spirits, but the other girl just looked at her with red, swollen eyes and began to cry all the harder . She was such a child.They killed my father . Did you expect me to do nothing?Washing won ’ t do any good, Sansa said . Not if you scrubbed all day and all night . The silk is ruined.The bald man clicked his teeth together . That is not the way, boy . This is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it . You will take the blade in one hand.A dozen caravan guards had come running . With them was the master himself, Merchant Captain Byan Votyris, a diminutive Norvoshi with skin like old leather and a bristling blue mustachio that swept up to his ears . He seemed to know what had happened without a word being spoken . Take this one away to await the pleasure of the khal, he commanded, gesturing at the man on the ground . Two guards hauled the wineseller to his feet . His goods I gift to you as well, Princess, the merchant captain went on . Small token of regret, that one of mine would do this thing.Well spoken, child, said the old man in white . As befits the daughter of Eddard Stark . I am honored to know you, however irregular the manner of our meeting . I am Ser Barristan Selmy, of the Kingsguard . He bowed.The captain was quick to appear, and even quicker to give them an escort when he recognized his lord ’ s son . They trotted past blackened fields and burned holdfasts, down to the riverlands and the Green Fork of the Trident . Tyrion saw no bodies, but the air was full of ravens and carrion crows; there had been fighting here, and recently.The thought of Jon filled Ned with a sense of shame, and a sorrow too deep for words . If only he could see the boy again, sit and talk with him … pain shot through his broken leg, beneath the filthy grey plaster of his cast . He winced, his fingers opening and closing helplessly . Is this your own scheme, he gasped out at Varys, or are you in league with Littlefinger?Jon poured with exaggerated care, vaguely aware that he was drawing out the act . When the cups were filled, he would have no choice but to face whatever was in that letter . Yet all too soon, they were filled . Sit, boy, Mormont commanded him . Drink.Moonlight winked on the tumbling waters of the stream below as it wound its rocky way along the floor of the valley . Beneath the trees, warhorses whickered softly and pawed at the moist, leafy ground, while men made nervous jests in hushed voices . Now and again, she heard the chink of spears, the faint metallic slither of chain mail, but even those sounds were muffled.The whisperings of little birds, Varys said, smiling . I know things, sweet lady . That is the nature of my service . He shrugged . You do have the dagger with you, yes?How many guards do you want, m ’ lady? Hal asked.Wordless, the knight fell to his knees . The men of her khas came up behind him . Jhogo was the first to lay his arakh at her feet . Blood of my blood, he murmured, pushing his face to the smoking earth . Blood of my blood, she heard Aggo echo . Blood of my blood, Rakharo shouted.The dungeon was under the Red Keep, deeper than he dared imagine . He remembered the old stories about Maegor the Cruel, who murdered all the masons who labored on his castle, so they might never reveal its secrets.The royal apartments were in Maegor ’ s Holdfast, a massive square fortress that nestled in the heart of the Red Keep behind walls twelve feet thick and a dry moat lined with iron spikes, a castle-within-a-castle . Ser Boros Blount guarded the far end of the bridge, white steel armor ghostly in the moonlight . Within, Ned passed two other knights of the Kingsguard; Ser Preston Greenfield stood at the bottom of the steps, and Ser Barristan Selmy waited at the door of the king ’ s bedchamber . Three men in white cloaks, he thought, remembering, and a strange chill went through him . Ser Barristan ’ s face was as pale as his armor . Ned had only to look at him to know that something was dreadfully wrong . The royal steward opened the door . Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the King, he announced.He rose and gestured brusquely to the guards . Leave us . The men departed . You were not mistreated, I trust, he said after they had gone . I gave firm instructions . He noticed her bandages . Your hands …She saw at once that Ned had reached a very different conclusion . The only truths I know are here . The south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid.Dany wrapped her arms around his shoulders and pressed her face against his neck as he thrust himself inside her . Three quick strokes and it was done . The stallion who mounts the world, Drogo whispered hoarsely . His hands still smelled of horse blood . He bit at her throat, hard, in the moment of his pleasure, and when he lifted her off, his seed filled her and trickled down the inside of her thighs . Only then was Doreah permitted to drape her in the scented sandsilk, and Irri to fit soft slippers to her feet.Across the garden, Tyrion Lannister got to his feet . Not this little man, he said . This little man is going down in the turnip hoist, thank you very much.Beyond the castle walls, a roar of sound went up . The foot soldiers and townsfolk were cheering Robb as he rode past, Bran knew; cheering for Lord Stark, for the Lord of Winterfell on his great stallion, with his cloak streaming and Grey Wind racing beside him . They would never cheer for him that way, he realized with a dull ache . He might be the lord in Winterfell while his brother and father were gone, but he was still Bran the Broken . He could not even get off his own horse, except to fall.He bowed his head . Yes, my lady, but the appointments—Viserys smiled and lowered his sword . That was the saddest thing, the thing that tore at her afterward … the way he smiled . That was all I wanted, he said . What was promised.That one means you no good, Princess, Mormont said . The Dothraki say a man and his bloodriders share one life, and Qotho sees it ending . A dead man is beyond fear.Catelyn ’ s mouth grew tight . Littlefinger, she murmured . His face swam up before her; a boy ’ s face, though he was a boy no longer . His father had died several years before, so he was Lord Baelish now, yet still they called him Littlefinger . Her brother Edmure had given him that name, long ago at Riverrun . His family ’ s modest holdings were on the smallest of the Fingers, and Petyr had been slight and short for his age.He sat high upon the immense ancient seat of Aegon the Conqueror, an ironwork monstrosity of spikes and jagged edges and grotesquely twisted metal . It was, as Robert had warned him, a hellishly uncomfortable chair, and never more so than now, with his shattered leg throbbing more sharply every minute . The metal beneath him had grown harder by the hour, and the fanged steel behind made it impossible to lean back . A king should never sit easy, Aegon the Conqueror had said, when he commanded his armorers to forge a great seat from the swords laid down by his enemies . Damn Aegon for his arrogance, Ned thought sullenly, and damn Robert and his hunting as well.Hurry, the trumpets called, hurry hurry hurry.I have made more mistakes than you can possibly imagine, Ned said, but that was not one of them.Catelyn ignored the implied question . I am not accustomed to being summoned like a serving wench, she said icily . As a boy, you still knew the meaning of courtesy.A man must make his own choices, Catelyn said . They earned the silver . How they spend it is no concern of mine.She ignored him, turning to the large party in blue and grey . They were the heart of the matter; there were more than twenty of them . I know your sigil as well: the twin towers of Frey . How fares your good lord, sers?She chose a simple dress of dark grey wool, plainly cut but richly embroidered around the collar and sleeves . Her fingers felt thick and clumsy as she struggled with the silver fastenings without the benefit of servants . Jeyne Poole had been confined with her, but Jeyne was useless . Her face was puffy from all her crying, and she could not seem to stop sobbing about her father.Everything Syrio Forel had ever taught her vanished in a heartbeat . In that instant of sudden terror, the only lesson Arya could remember was the one Jon Snow had given her, the very first.A friend, the cowled man said in a strange, low voice . We must speak alone, Lord Stark.No, Ned answered . He hated rest . The gods give him love and laughter, and the joy of righteous battle . It was strange how empty he felt . He had been expecting the visit, and yet with those words, something died within him . He would have given all his titles for the freedom to weep … but he was Robert ’ s Hand, and the hour he dreaded had come . Be so good as to summon the members of the council here to my solar, he told Pycelle . The Tower of the Hand was as secure as he and Tomard could make it; he could not say the same for the council chambers.Oh, my sweet summer child, Old Nan said quietly, what do you know of fear? Fear is for the winter, my little lord, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north . Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move through the woods.Even now, he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing . The southron had it easier . They had their septons to talk to, someone to tell them the gods ’ will and help sort out right from wrong . But the Starks worshiped the old gods, the nameless gods, and if the heart trees heard, they did not speak.Myrcella is a little baby . Arya grabbed Nymeria around her neck, but the moment she pulled out the brush again the direwolf wriggled free and bounded off . Frustrated, Arya threw down the brush . Bad wolf! she shouted.He must have heard her . It ’ s a mercy, he said . He ’ s dead already.Tyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of his shoulders . Speaking for the grotesques, he said, I beg to differ . Death is so terribly final, while life is full of possibilities.The question of who might win the tourney interested Eddard Stark not in the least . Is there a reason for this visit, Lord Petyr, or are you here simply to enjoy the view from my window?That seemed to amuse the eunuch . I would sooner wed the Black Goat of Qohor . Littlefinger is the second most devious man in the Seven Kingdoms . Oh, I feed him choice whispers, sufficient so that he thinks I am his … just as I allow Cersei to believe I am hers.Give it to me.Crippled, Mormont said . I ’ m sorry, boy . Read the rest of the letter.Catelyn nodded, not trusting to speak . The maester placed the paper on the table beside the bed . It was sealed with a small blob of blue wax . Luwin bowed and began to retreat.The hall was very quiet when Catelyn finished speaking.Much later, after he had taken the girls back through the city and seen them both safe in bed, Sansa with her dreams and Arya with her bruises, Ned ascended to his own chambers atop the Tower of the Hand . The day had been warm and the room was close and stuffy . Ned went to the window and unfastened the heavy shutters to let in the cool night air . Across the Great Yard, he noticed the flickering glow of candlelight from Littlefinger ’ s windows . The hour was well past midnight . Down by the river, the revels were only now beginning to dwindle and die.We were not there, Ser Gerold answered.Why are you stopping? Ser Waymar asked.Robert sat down again . Damn you, Ned Stark . You and Jon Arryn, I loved you both . What have you done to me? You were the one should have been king, you or Jon.That ’ s where I ’ m bound, the youth said . As she had suspected, he was more interested in telling his own story than in hearing theirs . Singers loved nothing half so well as the sound of their own voices . The Hand ’ s tourney means rich lords with fat purses . The last time I came away with more silver than I could carry … or would have, if I hadn ’ t lost it all betting on the Kingslayer to win the day.Yes, Catelyn admitted.This poisoner was the first, Ser Jorah Mormont warned him, but he will not be the last . Men will risk much for a lordship.You will be my khalasar, she told them . I see the faces of slaves . I free you . Take off your collars . Go if you wish, no one shall harm you . If you stay, it will be as brothers and sisters, husbands and wives . The black eyes watched her, wary, expressionless . I see the children, women, the wrinkled faces of the aged . I was a child yesterday . Today I am a woman . Tomorrow I will be old . To each of you I say, give me your hands and your hearts, and there will always be a place for you . She turned to the three young warriors of her khas . Jhogo, to you I give the silver-handled whip that was my bride gift, and name you ko, and ask your oath, that you will live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm.It is, the Old Bear told him . It was my father ’ s sword, and his father ’ s before him . The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries . I wielded it in my day and passed it on to my son when I took the black.The next morning it was Ser Brynden Tully himself who rode back to them . He had put aside the heavy plate and helm he ’ d worn as the Knight of the Gate for the lighter leather-and-mail of an outrider, but his obsidian fish still fastened his cloak.Master-at-arms of Winterfell, Clegane, and you would do well not to forget it.We put the steward ’ s girl in with her, Ser Boros said . We did not know what else to do with her.Before is not now, and this Hand is not the other, the scarred man said as they stepped out into the hall . Still as stone, Arya told herself, quiet as a shadow . Blinded by the blaze of their own torch, they did not see her pressed flat against the stone, only a few feet away.Poole had no sooner taken his leave than Tomard announced a visitor . Lord Baelish to see you, m ’ lord.Dany liked the strangeness of the Eastern Market too, with all its queer sights and sounds and smells . She often spent her mornings there, nibbling tree eggs, locust pie, and green noodles, listening to the high ululating voices of the spellsingers, gaping at manticores in silver cages and immense grey elephants and the striped black-and-white horses of the Jogos Nhai . She enjoyed watching all the people too: dark solemn Asshai ’ i and tall pale Qartheen, the bright-eyed men of Yi Ti in monkey-tail hats, warrior maids from Bayasabhad, Shamyriana, and Kayakayanaya with iron rings in their nipples and rubies in their cheeks, even the dour and frightening Shadow Men, who covered their arms and legs and chests with tattoos and hid their faces behind masks . The Eastern Market was a place of wonder and magic for Dany.Don ’ t be a fool, lad . You ’ re one against six . The tall woman, Osha, leveled her spear . Off the horse, and throw down the sword . We ’ ll thank you kindly for the mount and for the venison, and you and your brother can be on your way.Tyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed.Down here, might be that ’ s true, Maester, Yoren said, but up past the Wall, who ’ s to say? Up there, a man can ’ t always tell what ’ s alive and what ’ s dead.Dany glanced anxiously up at the high bench . Khal Drogo was saying something to the other khals beside him . Khal Jommo grinned, and Khal Ogo began to guffaw loudly.Ned laughed . I will gladly light the torch for you.The herald ’ s voice boomed out . If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.They were a people dark and beautiful, small of stature, no taller than children even when grown to manhood . They lived in the depths of the wood, in caves and crannogs and secret tree towns . Slight as they were, the children were quick and graceful . Male and female hunted together, with weirwood bows and flying snares . Their gods were the gods of the forest, stream, and stone, the old gods whose names are secret . Their wise men were called greenseers, and carved strange faces in the weirwoods to keep watch on the woods . How long the children reigned here or where they came from, no man can know.The night was warm, but the thought of Riverrun was enough to make her shiver . Where are they? she wondered . Could her uncle have been wrong? So much rested on the truth of what he had told them . Robb had given the Blackfish three hundred picked men, and sent them ahead to screen his march . Jaime does not know, Ser Brynden said when he rode back . I ’ ll stake my life on that . No bird has reached him, my archers have seen to that . We ’ ve seen a few of his outriders, but those that saw us did not live to tell of it . He ought to have sent out more . He does not know.And your brother?Long after their voices had faded away, Arya could still see the light of the torch, a smoking star that bid her follow . Twice it seemed to disappear, but she kept on straight, and both times she found herself at the top of steep, narrow stairs, the torch glimmering far below her . She hurried after it, down and down . Once she stumbled over a rock and fell against the wall, and her hand found raw earth supported by timbers, whereas before the tunnel had been dressed stone.Robert … Joffrey is not your son, he wanted to say, but the words would not come . The agony was written too plainly across Robert ’ s face; he could not hurt him more . So Ned bent his head and wrote, but where the king had said my son Joffrey, he scrawled my heir instead . The deceit made him feel soiled . The lies we tell for love, he thought . May the gods forgive me . What else would you have me say?She woke to a pounding on her door.Gods save me, some previous tenant had written on the wall in something that looked suspiciously like blood, the blue is calling . At first Tyrion wondered who he ’ d been, and what had become of him; later, he decided that he would rather not know.Tyrion grinned at him . That ’ s good, bastard . Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it.On your feet, Thorne repeated . The fat boy struggled to rise, slipped, and fell heavily again . Ser Piggy is starting to grasp the notion, Ser Alliser observed . Again.Wordlessly, Tyrion limped away . The cold had settled deep in his bones, and his legs were so sore he could scarcely walk . Perhaps his dead mare was the lucky one . He had hours more riding ahead of him, followed by a few mouthfuls of food and a short, cold sleep on hard ground, and then another night of the same, and another, and another, and the gods only knew how it would end . Damn her, he muttered as he struggled up the road to rejoin his captors, remembering, damn her and all the Starks.You must write your lady mother, and your brother, the eldest … what is his name?He should eat, he decided . Food would settle his stomach and give Ghost the chance to catch up . There was no danger yet; Castle Black still slept . In his saddlebag, he found a biscuit, a piece of cheese, and a small withered brown apple . He ’ d brought salt beef as well, and a rasher of bacon he ’ d filched from the kitchens, but he would save the meat for the morrow . After it was gone he ’ d need to hunt, and that would slow him.It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky . Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main party, his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses.On the day I am speaking of, the first sword was newly dead, and the Sealord sent for me . Many bravos had come to him, and as many had been sent away, none could say why . When I came into his presence, he was seated, and in his lap was a fat yellow cat . He told me that one of his captains had brought the beast to him, from an island beyond the sunrise . ‘ Have you ever seen her like? ’ he asked of me.Are you ready? Robb asked.Are you really falling? the crow asked back.They went inside, through a crowded common room where a fat woman was singing bawdy songs while pretty young girls in linen shifts and wisps of colored silk pressed themselves against their lovers and dandled on their laps . No one paid Ned the least bit of attention . Ser Rodrik waited below while Littlefinger led him up to the third floor, along a corridor, and through a door.Jon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling Grenn to his feet . The frosty morning air felt good on his face . He leaned on his sword, drew a deep breath, and allowed himself a moment to savor the victory.Dany climbed off her silver and gave the reins to one of the slaves . As Doreah and Irri arranged her cushions, she searched for her brother . Even across the length of the crowded hall, Viserys should have been conspicuous with his pale skin, silvery hair, and beggar ’ s rags, but she did not see him anywhere.Fourteen, the boy said.Tyrion grinned . That would have been amusing . I can just see him fending off Ser Vardis with his woodharp . He resumed his whistling . Do you know this song? he asked.There is a price, the godswife warned her.A squire . He shrugged . Fine, that ’ s fine, if he ’ s—His words were like an icy draft through her heart . No, she said, suddenly afraid . Was this to be her punishment? Never to see his face again, nor to feel his arms around her?Theon, she interrupted, where might I find my son?Chett gave a nasty laugh . I ’ ve seen what happens to soft lordlings when they ’ re put to work . Set them to churning butter and their hands blister and bleed . Give them an axe to split logs, and they cut off their own foot.Is there no other way?Ned gestured . Tomard and Cayn bowed their heads and backed away respectfully . Lord Renly glanced warily at Ser Boros on the far end of the span, at Ser Preston in the doorway behind them . That letter . He leaned close . Was it the regency? Has my brother named you Protector? He did not wait for a reply . My lord, I have thirty men in my personal guard, and other friends beside, knights and lords . Give me an hour, and I can put a hundred swords in your hand.Viserys laughed . They can ’ t kill us . They can ’ t shed blood here in the sacred city … but I can . He laid the point of his sword between Daenerys ’ s breasts and slid it downward, over the curve of her belly . I want what I came for, he told her . I want the crown he promised me . He bought you, but he never paid for you . Tell him I want what I bargained for, or I ’ m taking you back . You and the eggs both . He can keep his bloody foal . I ’ ll cut the bastard out and leave it for him . The sword point pushed through her silks and pricked at her navel . Viserys was weeping, she saw; weeping and laughing, both at the same time, this man who had once been her brother.The Lord Commander reached up to pinch its beak shut, but the raven hopped up on his head, fluttered its wings, and flew across the chamber to light above a window . Grief and noise, Mormont grumbled . That ’ s all they ’ re good for, ravens . Why I put up with that pestilential bird … if there was news of Lord Eddard, don ’ t you think I would have sent for you? Bastard or no, you ’ re still his blood . The message concerned Ser Barristan Selmy . It seems he ’ s been removed from the Kingsguard . They gave his place to that black dog Clegane, and now Selmy ’ s wanted for treason . The fools sent some watchmen to seize him, but he slew two of them and escaped . Mormont snorted, leaving no doubt of his view of men who ’ d send gold cloaks against a knight as renowed as Barristan the Bold . We have white shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls, and a boy sits the Iron Throne, he said in disgust.When I was a boy, Tyrion replied, my wet nurse told me that one day, if men were good, the gods would give the world a summer without ending . Perhaps we ’ ve been better than we thought, and the Great Summer is finally at hand . He grinned.A soft knock at the door behind her turned Arya away from the window and her dreams of escape . Arya, her father ’ s voice called out . Open the door . We need to talk.She thought of Mycah again and her eyes filled with tears . Her fault, her fault, her fault . If she had never asked him to play at swords with her …The cream-and-gold dragon was suckling at her left breast, the green-and-bronze at the right . Her arms cradled them close . The black-and-scarlet beast was draped across her shoulders, its long sinuous neck coiled under her chin . When it saw Jorah, it raised its head and looked at him with eyes as red as coals.Summer began to howl.Very well . Send him in.There ’ s no mention of Arya, Robb pointed out, miserable.Ser Jorah snorted . Can you wake the dead, girl? Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon, and he died on the Trident . Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.He wondered what Lord Eddard might have done if the deserter had been his brother Benjen instead of that ragged stranger . Would it have been any different? It must, surely, surely … and Robb would welcome him, for a certainty . He had to, or else …The dagger fell away from Bran ’ s throat . The big man swayed and collapsed, facedown in the stream . The arrow broke beneath him . Bran watched his life go swirling off in the water.When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their lord commander, his father said.Better than you, you chinless craven, Tyrion thought . Jaime might have lost Riverrun, but it angered him to hear his brother slandered by the likes of Swyft, a shameless lickspittle whose greatest accomplishment was marrying his equally chinless daughter to Ser Kevan, and thereby attaching himself to the Lannisters.The ground was so far below him he could barely make it out through the grey mists that whirled around him, but he could feel how fast he was falling, and he knew what was waiting for him down there . Even in dreams, you could not fall forever . He would wake up in the instant before he hit the ground, he knew . You always woke up in the instant before you hit the ground.He awaits you in his solar, Edmure said.Masha Heddle was beside herself . M ’ lord, there ’ s nothing, it ’ s the tourney, there ’ s no help for it, oh …Wind . Trees rustling . A wolf . Which sound is it that unmans you so, Gared? When Gared did not answer, Royce slid gracefully from his saddle . He tied the destrier securely to a low-hanging limb, well away from the other horses, and drew his longsword from its sheath . Jewels glittered in its hilt, and the moonlight ran down the shining steel . It was a splendid weapon, castle-forged, and new-made from the look of it . Will doubted it had ever been swung in anger.Say you have the truth of it, then, Catelyn said with a courtesy that made her mouth ache . What will we gain by the dwarf ’ s death? Do you imagine that Jaime will care a fig that we gave his brother a trial before we flung him off a mountain?I ’ ll wake up when I hit the ground, Bran told the bird.Marsh turned his smile on Jon . Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward, Jon . You ’ ll sleep in a cell beneath his chambers, in the Lord Commander ’ s tower.Littlefinger groaned in dismay . My lords—The Hound ’ s scarred face was hard to read . He took a long moment to consider . Why not? I have no lands nor wife to forsake, and who ’ d care if I did? The burned side of his mouth twisted . But I warn you, I ’ ll say no knight ’ s vows.Arya thought about it . You saw what was there.Do you? The queen watched his face, wary as a cat . Is that why you called me here, Lord Stark? To pose me riddles? Or is it your intent to seize me, as your wife seized my brother?The lad swears Lord Jon was as strong as a man half his age . Often went riding with Lord Stannis, he says.When Lysa espied Catelyn, she welcomed her with a sisterly embrace and a moist kiss on the cheek . Isn ’ t it a lovely morning? The gods are smiling on us . Do try a cup of the wine, sweet sister . Lord Hunter was kind enough to send for it, from his own cellars.Ser Mandon Moore went to take his place under the throne beside two of his fellows of the Kingsguard . Sansa hovered by the door, for once unguarded . The queen had given her freedom of the castle as a reward for being good, yet even so, she was escorted everywhere she went . Honor guards for my daughter-to-be, the queen called them, but they did not make Sansa feel honored.You know my feelings, Sansa . It seems I must arrange Robert ’ s games and pretend to be honored for his sake . That does not mean I must subject my daughters to this folly.I have heard it said that poison is a woman ’ s weapon.Mine? What would I do with an oathbreaker?What do you pray for, Ser Jorah? she asked him.His bare cheeks were ruddy with the cold, and his legs complained more loudly with every step, but Tyrion ignored them . The wind swirled around him, gravel crunched beneath his boots, while ahead the white ribbon followed the lines of the hills, rising higher and higher, until it was lost beyond the western horizon . He passed a massive catapult, as tall as a city wall, its base sunk deep into the Wall . The throwing arm had been taken off for repairs and then forgotten; it lay there like a broken toy, half-embedded in the ice.Sansa drew her blanket up to her chin to cover herself . No, she whimpered, please … leave me be.The walk was short, but the ground was rough underfoot and his legs were cramping badly by the time they got back . Jon Snow offered a hand to help him over a thick tangle of roots, but Tyrion shook him off . He would make his own way, as he had all his life . Still, the camp was a welcome sight . The shelters had been thrown up against the tumbledown wall of a long-abandoned holdfast, a shield against the wind . The horses had been fed and a fire had been laid . Yoren sat on a stone, skinning a squirrel . The savory smell of stew filled Tyrion ’ s nostrils . He dragged himself over to where his man Morrec was tending the stewpot . Wordlessly, Morrec handed him the ladle . Tyrion tasted and handed it back . More pepper, he said.The king shifted uncomfortably in his saddle . Perhaps . There are ships to be had in the Free Cities, though . I tell you, Ned, I do not like this marriage . There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper . Do you forget how many houses fought for Targaryen in the war? They bide their time for now, but give them half a chance, they will murder me in my bed, and my sons with me . If the beggar king crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the traitors will join him.Renly? she said, shocked . I had thought, surely it would be Lord Stannis …Certainly Varys had once been young . Ned doubted that he had ever been innocent . You mention children . Robert had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen . Whatever arrangements you made, I want unmade . At once.If Khal Drogo had been with her, Dany would have ridden her silver . Among the Dothraki, mothers stayed on horseback almost up to the moment of birth, and she did not want to seem weak in her husband ’ s eyes . But with the khal off hunting, it was pleasant to lie back on soft cushions and be carried across Vaes Dothrak, with red silk curtains to shield her from the sun . Ser Jorah saddled up and rode beside her, with the four young men of her khas and her handmaids.Arya chewed her lip and said nothing . She would not betray Jon, not even to their father.Good, she said . She could hear echoes of Ned in his voice, as he sat there, puzzling over the map . Tell me more.Me? The man laughed . I am not worthy of this vintage, my lord . And it ’ s a poor wine merchant who drinks up his own wares . His smile was amiable, yet she could see the sheen of sweat on his brow.Would that I could, Catelyn said . The letter had other tidings . The king is riding to Winterfell to seek you out.The steel must be part of your arm, the bald man told her . Can you drop part of your arm? No . Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos, he knows these things . Listen to him, boy.As you command, my lord.She snatched up the bridle and harness again and ran to her mare, but as she lifted the saddle to the horse ’ s back, Arya realized with a sudden sick dread that the castle gates would be closed . Even the postern doors would likely be guarded . Maybe the guards wouldn ’ t recognize her . If they thought she was a boy, perhaps they ’ d let her … no, they ’ d have orders not to let anyone out, it wouldn ’ t matter whether they knew her or not.No! Bran shouted from the high seat as Lannister ’ s men reached for their steel . Summer, here . Summer, to me!Maester Luwin says there are no more giants . He says they ’ re all dead, like the children of the forest . All that ’ s left of them are old bones in the earth that men turn up with plows from time to time.Ai, Khaleesi, Jhogo replied, kicking his horse . Quaro and the others followed his lead, the bells in their hair chiming.That frightened cow shared Jon Arryn ’ s bed.I didn ’ t do anything wrong, Sansa pleaded with him . I don ’ t want to go back . She loved King ’ s Landing; the pagaentry of the court, the high lords and ladies in their velvets and silks and gemstones, the great city with all its people . The tournament had been the most magical time of her whole life, and there was so much she had not seen yet, harvest feasts and masked balls and mummer shows . She could not bear the thought of losing it all . Send Arya away, she started it, Father, I swear it . I ’ ll be good, you ’ ll see, just let me stay and I promise to be as fine and noble and courteous as the queen.Doubtless you loved your father, Mormont said when Jon brought him his horn . The things we love destroy us every time, lad . Remember when I told you that?Let him keep it . Catelyn Stark looked down from her horse . And see that he has his axe back as well . We may have need of it if we are attacked again.You some kind of cripple? asked the short woman.He had to wait what seemed an eternity, standing there inside the bars with the Wall to his back . Long enough for Tyrion to begin to wonder why he was doing this . He had just about decided to forget his sudden whim and go to bed when the cage gave a jerk and began to ascend.Whatever you may decide for yourselves, I shall never call a Lannister my king, declared Marq Piper.The warriors were watching too . One of them finally stepped into the circle, grabbed a dancer by the arm, pushed her down to the ground, and mounted her right there, as a stallion mounts a mare . Illyrio had told her that might happen . The Dothraki mate like the animals in their herds . There is no privacy in a khalasar, and they do not understand sin or shame as we do.We had to throw rocks, she said miserably . I told her to run, to go be free, that I didn ’ t want her anymore . There were other wolves for her to play with, we heard them howling, and Jory said the woods were full of game, so she ’ d have deer to hunt . Only she kept following, and finally we had to throw rocks . I hit her twice . She whined and looked at me and I felt so ’ shamed, but it was right, wasn ’ t it? The queen would have killed her.Bran looked at the crow on his shoulder, and the crow looked back . It had three eyes, and the third eye was full of a terrible knowledge . Bran looked down . There was nothing below him now but snow and cold and death, a frozen wasteland where jagged blue-white spires of ice waited to embrace him . They flew up at him like spears . He saw the bones of a thousand other dreamers impaled upon their points . He was desperately afraid.Poison, Ned suggested quietly.Jon said . [BOS] First lesson, Stick them with the pointy end . [EOS] Grand Maester Pycelle was seated alone at the council table, seemingly asleep, his hands clasped together atop his beard . She saw Lord Varys hurry into the hall, his feet making no sound . A moment later Lord Baelish entered through the tall doors in the rear, smiling . He chatted amiably with Ser Balon and Ser Dontos as he made his way to the front . Butterflies fluttered nervously in Sansa ’ s stomach . I shouldn ’ t be afraid, she told herself . I have nothing to be afraid of, it will all come out well, Joff loves me and the queen does too, she said so.I do . Robb spurred his horse forward . He was in his armor, with the direwolf shield of Winterfell strapped to his saddle and Grey Wind padding by his side.The morning was overcast and grim . Ned broke his fast with his daughters and Septa Mordane . Sansa, still disconsolate, stared sullenly at her food and refused to eat, but Arya wolfed down everything that was set in front of her . Syrio says we have time for one last lesson before we take ship this evening, she said . Can I, Father? All my things are packed.And how could he go unnoticed? she said sharply.Even his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world . Up here, the genial Benjen Stark he had known became a different person . He was First Ranger, and he spent his days and nights with Lord Commander Mormont and Maester Aemon and the other high officers, while Jon was given over to the less than tender charge of Ser Alliser Thorne.Robb sat in the bow with Grey Wind, his hand resting on his direwolf ’ s head as the rowers pulled at their oars . Theon Greyjoy was with him . Her uncle Brynden would come behind in the second boat, with the Greatjon and Lord Karstark.Ser Jaremy stood . The Wildlings have axes too.Who might you be? Lord Tywin asked, cool as snow.Tell me, Arya said.It was cold . Shivering, Will clung more tightly to his perch . His face pressed hard against the trunk of the sentinel . He could feel the sweet, sticky sap on his cheek.Ser Balon Swann also fell to Gregor, and Lord Renly to the Hound . Renly was unhorsed so violently that he seemed to fly backward off his charger, legs in the air . His head hit the ground with an audible crack that made the crowd gasp, but it was just the golden antler on his helm . One of the tines had snapped off beneath him . When Lord Renly climbed to his feet, the commons cheered wildly, for King Robert ’ s handsome young brother was a great favorite . He handed the broken tine to his conqueror with a gracious bow . The Hound snorted and tossed the broken antler into the crowd, where the commons began to punch and claw over the little bit of gold, until Lord Renly walked out among them and restored the peace . By then Septa Mordane had returned, alone . Jeyne had been feeling ill, she explained; she had helped her back to the castle . Sansa had almost forgotten about Jeyne.I find you oddly cheering, Tyrion said . I must be mad.Arya glared at her . I have to go shoe a horse, she said sweetly, taking a brief satisfaction in the shock on the septa ’ s face . Then she whirled and made her exit, running down the steps as fast as her feet would take her.None of us are here for asking, Sam reminded him.Then Royce ’ s parry came a beat too late . The pale sword bit through the ringmail beneath his arm . The young lord cried out in pain . Blood welled between the rings . It steamed in the cold, and the droplets seemed red as fire where they touched the snow . Ser Waymar ’ s fingers brushed his side . His moleskin glove came away soaked with red.If he comes so far, but no one thinks he will, Robb said . I ’ ve sent word to Howland Reed, Father ’ s old friend at Greywater Watch . If the Lannisters come up the Neck, the crannogmen will bleed them every step of the way, but Galbart Glover says Lord Tywin is too smart for that, and Roose Bolton agrees . He ’ ll stay close to the Trident, they believe, taking the castles of the river lords one by one, until Riverrun stands alone . We need to march south to meet him.And you, Uncle, she said, smiling despite all she had been through . Hearing that hoarse, smoky voice again took her back twenty years, to the days of her childhood.Lord Hoster smiled . I saw . Last night, when it began, I told them … had to see . They carried me to the gatehouse … watched from the battlements . Ah, that was beautiful … the torches came in a wave, I could hear the cries floating across the river … sweet cries … when that siege tower went up, gods … would have died then, and glad, if only I could have seen you children first . Was it your boy who did it? Was it your Robb?His sword helped taint the throne you sit on, Ned thought, but he did not permit the words to pass his lips . He swore a vow to protect his king ’ s life with his own . Then he opened that king ’ s throat with a sword.I don ’ t want any more stories, Bran snapped, his voice petulant . He had liked Old Nan and her stories once . Before . But it was different now . They left her with him all day now, to watch over him and clean him and keep him from being lonely, but she just made it worse . I hate your stupid stories.Nor I! yelled the little Darry boy . I never will!The slim young serving girl took quick note of Ned ’ s badge and the sigil on his doublet, and the master came hurrying out, all smiles and bows . Wine for the King ’ s Hand, he told the girl, gesturing Ned to a couch . I am Tobho Mott, my lord, please, please, put yourself at ease . He wore a black velvet coat with hammers embroidered on the sleeves in silver thread . Around his neck was a heavy silver chain and a sapphire as large as a pigeon ’ s egg . If you are in need of new arms for the Hand ’ s tourney, you have come to the right shop . Ned did not bother to correct him . My work is costly, and I make no apologies for that, my lord, he said as he filled two matching silver goblets . You will not find craftsmanship equal to mine anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms, I promise you . Visit every forge in King ’ s Landing if you like, and compare for yourself . Any village smith can hammer out a shirt of mail; my work is art.You are your mother ’ s trueborn son of Lannister.What are you looking at? Joffrey said . This is what I wanted you to see, right here.The crow is the raven ’ s poor cousin . They are both beggars in black, hated and misunderstood.When they finally spied Castle Black, its timbered keeps and stone towers looked like nothing more than a handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow, beneath the vast wall of ice . The ancient stronghold of the black brothers was no Winterfell, no true castle at all . Lacking walls, it could not be defended, not from the south, or east, or west; but it was only the north that concerned the Night ’ s Watch, and to the north loomed the Wall . Almost seven hundred feet high it stood, three times the height of the tallest tower in the stronghold it sheltered . His uncle said the top was wide enough for a dozen armored knights to ride abreast . The gaunt outlines of huge catapults and monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry up there, like the skeletons of great birds, and among them walked men in black as small as ants.Something in his tone made Bran even more fearful . What will you do? he asked as Theon Greyjoy reined in beside them.He went with Greyjoy to the hall, I believe.In your dream …?I have every hope that you will live to be a hundred.The height of the Iron Throne gave Joffrey a better vantage point than anyone else in the hall . He was the first to see her . Come forward, my lady, he called out, smiling.Me too? Tears welled in Sansa ’ s eyes . That ’ s not fair.A red-haired whore in a wisp of painted silk pushed open a second-story window . Is it the boy king that ’ s died now? she shouted down, leaning out over the street . Ah, that ’ s a boy for you, they never last long . As she laughed, a naked man slid his arms around her from behind, biting her neck and rubbing the heavy white breasts that hung loose beneath her shift.They are coming, Catelyn thought.A sudden silence descended over the party . The men looked at the antler uneasily, and no one dared to speak . Even Bran could sense their fear, though he did not understand.Do you Starks have nought but snow between your ears? Littlefinger asked . The Imp would never have acted alone.My daughter commands us to ride for King ’ s Landing at once, to defend the Red Keep against King Renly and the Knight of Flowers . His mouth tightened . Commands us, mind you . In the name of the king and council.Oh . Dany felt disappointed, but Quaro liked his sausage so well he decided to have another one, and Rakharo had to outdo him and eat three more, belching loudly . Dany giggled.They would of done the same for us, but the Sherrer holdfast ’ s made of stone, Joss said . Some wanted to smoke us out, but the big one said there was riper fruit up river, and they made for the Mummer ’ s Ford.A hundred merchants and traders were unloading their goods and setting up in stalls when they arrived, yet even so the great market seemed hushed and deserted compared to the teeming bazaars that Dany remembered from Pentos and the other Free Cities . The caravans made their way to Vaes Dothrak from east and west not so much to sell to the Dothraki as to trade with each other, Ser Jorah had explained . The riders let them come and go unmolested, so long as they observed the peace of the sacred city, did not profane the Mother of Mountains or the Womb of the World, and honored the crones of the dosh khaleen with the traditional gifts of salt, silver, and seed . The Dothraki did not truly comprehend this business of buying and selling.Ned took another swallow of milk, trying not to gag on the sweetness of it . Did it seem to you that there was anything unnatural about Lord Arryn ’ s death?You have wings, Bran pointed out.Robert Baratheon took a long swallow of beer, tossed the empty horn onto his sleeping furs, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and said darkly, Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your king? He let go his laughter, sudden as a storm . Ah, damn you, Ned, why are you always right?I thought so . Mormont peeled the shell off a boiled egg . Your father is dead, lad . Do you think you can bring him back?Do you take me for a Dothraki? Tyrion asked sourly . The Dothraki ate horse, in truth; they also left deformed children out for the feral dogs who ran behind their khalasars . Dothraki customs had scant appeal for him.One word, Tyrion said, and I will hit you again.And suddenly the corpse ’ s weight was gone, its fingers ripped from his throat . It was all Jon could do to roll over, retching and shaking . Ghost had it again . He watched as the direwolf buried his teeth in the wight ’ s gut and began to rip and tear . He watched, only half conscious, for a long moment before he finally remembered to look for his sword …Tobho Mott gave him a cool, careful look . As you wish, my lord, he said with no trace of his former friendliness . He led Ned out a rear door and across a narrow yard, back to the cavernous stone barn where the work was done . When the armorer opened the door, the blast of hot air that came through made Ned feel as though he were walking into a dragon ’ s mouth . Inside, a forge blazed in each corner, and the air stank of smoke and sulfur . Journeymen armorers glanced up from their hammers and tongs just long enough to wipe the sweat from their brows, while bare-chested apprentice boys worked the bellows.My lady? Standing, the old knight took off his high white helm, though he did not seem to understand why.Theon and the others fell farther and farther behind, until Bran could no longer hear their voices . From ahead came the faint sound of rushing waters . It grew louder until they reached the stream . Tears stung his eyes.Fat and awkward and frightened he might be, but Samwell Tarly was no fool . One night he visited Jon in his cell . I don ’ t know what you did, he said, but I know you did it . He looked away shyly . I ’ ve never had a friend before.Oh, of a certainty, said Moreo . Though perhaps I should hold it for them until we return to Tyrosh . For the sake of their wives and children . If you give them the silver here, my lady, they will dice it away or spend it all for a night ’ s pleasure.The crow opened its beak and cawed at him, a shrill scream of fear, and the grey mists shuddered and swirled around him and ripped away like a veil, and he saw that the crow was really a woman, a serving woman with long black hair, and he knew her from somewhere, from Winterfell, yes, that was it, he remembered her now, and then he realized that he was in Winterfell, in a bed high in some chilly tower room, and the black-haired woman dropped a basin of water to shatter on the floor and ran down the steps, shouting, He ’ s awake, he ’ s awake, he ’ s awake.Rhaenys was a child too . Prince Rhaegar ’ s daughter . A precious little thing, younger than your girls . She had a small black kitten she called Balerion, did you know? I always wondered what happened to him . Rhaenys liked to pretend he was the true Balerion, the Black Dread of old, but I imagine the Lannisters taught her the difference between a kitten and a dragon quick enough, the day they broke down her door . Varys gave a long weary sigh, the sigh of a man who carried all the sadness of the world in a sack upon his shoulders . The High Septon once told me that as we sin, so do we suffer . If that ’ s true, Lord Eddard, tell me … why is it always the innocents who suffer most, when you high lords play your game of thrones? Ponder it, if you would, while you wait upon the queen . And spare a thought for this as well: The next visitor who calls on you could bring you bread and cheese and the milk of the poppy for your pain … or he could bring you Sansa ’ s head.There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead, Catelyn told him . She had slept many a night there in her youth, traveling with her father . Lord Hoster Tully had been a restless man in his prime, always riding somewhere . She still remembered the innkeep, a fat woman named Masha Heddle who chewed sourleaf night and day and seemed to have an endless supply of smiles and sweet cakes for the children . The sweet cakes had been soaked with honey, rich and heavy on the tongue, but how Catelyn had dreaded those smiles . The sourleaf had stained Masha ’ s teeth a dark red, and made her smile a bloody horror.For knighthood?You leave him alone! Sansa screamed at her sister.Greyjoy was doubtful . That ’ s madness.What is it? Bran asked.They kept their pledge . When Aegon slew Black Harren and claimed his kingdom, Harren ’ s brother was Lord Commander on the Wall, with ten thousand swords to hand . He did not march . In the days when the Seven Kingdoms were seven kingdoms, not a generation passed that three or four of them were not at war . The Watch took no part . When the Andals crossed the narrow sea and swept away the kingdoms of the First Men, the sons of the fallen kings held true to their vows and remained at their posts . So it has always been, for years beyond counting . Such is the price of honor.His courser was as slim as her rider, a beautiful grey mare, built for speed . Ser Gregor ’ s huge stallion trumpeted as he caught her scent . The boy from Highgarden did something with his legs, and his horse pranced sideways, nimble as a dancer . Sansa clutched at his arm . Father, don ’ t let Ser Gregor hurt him, she said . Ned saw she was wearing the rose that Ser Loras had given her yesterday . Jory had told him about that as well.Lysa Arryn glanced at her sister coolly for a moment, then rose and swept down on Tyrion, her long skirts trailing after her . For an instant he feared she would strike him, but instead she commanded them to release him . Her men shoved him to the floor, his legs went out from under him, and Tyrion fell.Why would you want me as your Hand, if you refuse to listen to my counsel?The earth ends at the black salt sea, Drogo answered at once . He wet a cloth in a basin of warm water to wipe the sweat and oil from his skin . No horse can cross the poison water.And so they left her direwolf and his bodyguard behind them, while they ranged east along the north bank of the Trident with no company save Lion ’ s Tooth.You are quick, for a dancing master, said Ser Meryn.We are taking him back to Winterfell, she said, and Tyrion thought, Well, perhaps … By then he ’ d had a moment to glance over the room and get a better idea of the situation . He was not altogether displeased by what he saw . Oh, the Stark woman had been clever, no doubt of it . Force them to make a public affirmation of the oaths sworn her father by the lords they served, and then call on them for succor, and her a woman, yes, that was sweet . Yet her success was not as complete as she might have liked . There were close to fifty in the common room by his rough count . Catelyn Stark ’ s plea had roused a bare dozen; the others looked confused, or frightened, or sullen . Only two of the Freys had stirred, Tyrion noted, and they ’ d sat back down quick enough when their captain failed to move . He might have smiled if he ’ d dared.For a moment her anger flared . If you were strong enough to climb your own battlements, Lord Frey, you would see that my son has twenty thousand men outside your walls.Are they dead? Royce asked softly . What proof have we?They are men, Robb, seasoned in battle . You were fighting with wooden swords less than a year past.The engraved silver blade was beautiful beyond a doubt, but it seemed to Catelyn that Ser Vardis might have been more comfortable with his own sword . Yet she said nothing; she was weary of futile arguments with her sister.It was not until later that night, as she was drifting off to sleep, that Sansa realized she had forgotten to ask about her sister.She ’ s upset you, the queen said gently . We can ’ t be having that . Not another word, now . Lord Baelish will see that Jeyne ’ s well taken care of, I promise you . She patted the chair beside her . Sit down, Sansa . I want to talk to you.Littlefinger smiled . Leave Lord Varys to me, sweet lady . If you will permit me a small obscenity—and where better for it than here—I hold the man ’ s balls in the palm of my hand . He cupped his fingers, smiling . Or would, if he were a man, or had any balls . You see, if the pie is opened, the birds begin to sing, and Varys would not like that . Were I you, I would worry more about the Lannisters and less about the eunuch.Kinder, Varys said . Oh, well and truly spoken, Grand Maester . It is so true . Should the gods in their caprice grant Daenerys Targaryen a son, the realm must bleed.In the yard below, Rickon ran with the wolves.Dywen sucked at his wooden teeth . Might be they didn ’ t die here . Might be someone brought ’ em and left ’ em for us . A warning, as like . The old forester peered down suspiciously . And might be I ’ m a fool, but I don ’ t know that Othor never had no blue eyes afore.The high road, Tyrion Lannister said . Lysa allowed herself a faint, satisfied smile . It was another sort of death sentence, Catelyn realized . Tyrion Lannister must know that as well . Yet the dwarf favored Lady Arryn with a mocking bow . As you command, my lady, he said . I believe we know the way.She tied the pigeon to her belt and started down the street . A man was pushing a load of tarts by on a two-wheeled cart; the smells sang of blueberries and lemons and apricots . Her stomach made a hollow rumbly noise . Could I have one? she heard herself say . A lemon, or … or any kind.A lordling, Pyp observed to Jon . Southron, most like near Highgarden . Pyp had traveled the Seven Kingdoms with a mummers ’ troupe, and bragged that he could tell what you were and where you ’ d been born just from the sound of your voice.Dany saw one boy bolt and run for the river . A rider cut him off and turned him, and the others boxed him in, cracking their whips in his face, running him this way and that . One galloped behind him, lashing him across the buttocks until his thighs ran red with blood . Another snared his ankle with a lash and sent him sprawling . Finally, when the boy could only crawl, they grew bored of the sport and put an arrow through his back.There were no heralds, no banners, no horns nor drums, only the twang of bowstrings as Morrec and Lharys let fly, and suddenly the clansmen came thundering out of the dawn, lean dark men in boiled leather and mismatched armor, faces hidden behind barred half helms . In gloved hands were clutched all manner of weapons: longswords and lances and sharpened scythes, spiked clubs and daggers and heavy iron mauls . At their head rode a big man in a striped shadowskin cloak, armed with a two-handed greatsword.The old man shook her so hard her teeth rattled . Shut your mouth and close your eyes, boy . Dimly, as if from far away, she heard a … a noise … a soft sighing sound, as if a million people had let out their breath at once . The old man ’ s fingers dug into her arm, stiff as iron . Look at me . Yes, that ’ s the way of it, at me . Sour wine perfumed his breath . Remember, boy?Or my brother Jaime, Tyrion said . We shall know soon enough . He surveyed his ragged band of brigands: near three hundred Stone Crows, Moon Brothers, Black Ears, and Burned Men, and those just the seed of the army he hoped to grow . Gunthor son of Gurn was raising the other clans even now . He wondered what his lord father would make of them in their skins and bits of stolen steel . If truth be told, he did not know what to make of them himself . Was he their commander or their captive? Most of the time, it seemed to be a little of both . It might be best if I rode down alone, he suggested.Robb, already sweaty from a previous bout, moved forward eagerly . Gladly.Hodor, Hodor said, and he trotted forward smiling and set Bran in the high seat of the Starks, where the Lords of Winterfell had sat since the days when they called themselves the Kings in the North . The seat was cold stone, polished smooth by countless bottoms; the carved heads of direwolves snarled on the ends of its massive arms . Bran clasped them as he sat, his useless legs dangling . The great seat made him feel half a baby.How did you know I was in the city? she asked him.That ’ s not true, Arya said loudly . She just bit him a little . He was hurting Mycah.Bells rang, a sudden clangor of bronze birds . A deep-throated warhorn sounded its long low note . The old women began to chant . Underneath their painted leather vests, their withered dugs swayed back and forth, shiny with oil and sweat . The eunuchs who served them threw bundles of dried grasses into a great bronze brazier, and clouds of fragrant smoke rose up toward the moon and the stars . The Dothraki believed the stars were horses made of fire, a great herd that galloped across the sky by night.Yes? Mormont growled impatiently . Blood, what of it?She was a traitor . Joffrey looked pouty; somehow she was upsetting him . You haven ’ t said what you mean to give me for my name day . Maybe I should give you something instead, would you like that?A craven can be as brave as any man, when there is nothing to fear . And we all do our duty, when there is no cost to it . How easy it seems then, to walk the path of honor . Yet soon or late in every man ’ s life comes a day when it is not easy, a day when he must choose.Catelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood, seated on a moss-covered stone . The greatsword Ice was across his lap, and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night . A thousand years of humus lay thick upon the godswood floor, swallowing the sound of her feet, but the red eyes of the weirwood seemed to follow her as she came . Ned, she called softly.Tyrion shivered . Now there was a nasty suspicion . Perhaps the direwolf and the lion were not the only beasts in the woods, and if that was true, someone was using him as a catspaw . Tyrion Lannister hated being used.Is he? Dany asked . A fool, I mean?And last of all, Khal Drogo brought forth his own bride gift to her . An expectant hush rippled out from the center of the camp as he left her side, growing until it had swallowed the whole khalasar . When he returned, the dense press of Dothraki gift-givers parted before him, and he led the horse to her.When Pycelle was gone, Ned called for a cup of honeyed wine . That clouded the mind as well, yet not as badly . He needed to be able to think . A thousand times, he asked himself what Jon Arryn might have done, had he lived long enough to act on what he ’ d learned . Or perhaps he had acted, and died for it.Yes . Jon knelt, and Sam knelt beside him.They walked, with Ghost pacing along beside Jon like a white shadow . I leave on the morrow, Tyrion said.King Robert had grown louder with each course . From time to time Sansa could hear him laughing or roaring a command over the music and the clangor of plates and cutlery, but they were too far away for her to make out his words.Jon said . [BOS] These two are Grenn and Pypar, [EOS] Khal Drogo reeled in the saddle, tilted slowly, and fell heavily from his horse . The flies scattered for a heartbeat, and then circled back to settle on him where he lay.Poison is a coward ’ s weapon, the king complained.Let him talk, Catelyn Stark commanded.Robert ’ s face was purple . Out, he croaked, choking on his rage . Out, damn you, I ’ m done with you . What are you waiting for? Go, run back to Winterfell . And make certain I never look on your face again, or I swear, I ’ ll have your head on a spike!Ned scowled . The king lies wounded and near to death.A dozen years, Ned said . How is it that you have had no children by the king?Sansa could never understand how two sisters, born only two years apart, could be so different . It would have been easier if Arya had been a bastard, like their half brother Jon . She even looked like Jon, with the long face and brown hair of the Starks, and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her coloring . And Jon ’ s mother had been common, or so people whispered . Once, when she was littler, Sansa had even asked Mother if perhaps there hadn ’ t been some mistake . Perhaps the grumkins had stolen her real sister . But Mother had only laughed and said no, Arya was her daughter and Sansa ’ s trueborn sister, blood of their blood . Sansa could not think why Mother would want to lie about it, so she supposed it had to be true.Is scratch, moon of life, from arakh of one bloodrider to Khal Ogo, Khal Drogo said in the Common Tongue . I kill him for it, and Ogo too . He turned his head, the bells in his braid ringing softly . Is Ogo you hear, and Fogo his khalakka, who was khal when I slew him.He is, the Lady Lysa had said from the lesser throne beside him . She was all in blue, powdered and perfumed for the suitors who filled her court.Ser Ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years, Lord Renly commented with a sly smile.Khal Drogo smiled . See how fierce she grows! he said . It is my son inside her, the stallion who mounts the world, filling her with his fire . Ride slowly, Qotho … if the mother does not burn you where you sit, the son will trample you into the mud . And you, Mago, hold your tongue and find another lamb to mount . These belong to my khaleesi . He started to reach out a hand to Daenerys, but as he lifted his arm Drogo grimaced in sudden pain and turned his head.My son brought dishonor to House Mormont, but at least he had the grace to leave the sword behind when he fled . My sister returned it to my keeping, but the very sight of it reminded me of Jorah ’ s shame, so I put it aside and thought no more of it until we found it in the ashes of my bedchamber . The original pommel was a bear ’ s head, silver, yet so worn its features were all but indistinguishable . For you, I thought a white wolf more apt . One of our builders is a fair stonecarver.The trees press close here, Will warned . That sword will tangle you up, m ’ lord . Better a knife.She climbed the pyre herself to place the eggs around her sun-and-stars . The black beside his heart, under his arm . The green beside his head, his braid coiled around it . The cream-and-gold down between his legs . When she kissed him for the last time, Dany could taste the sweetness of the oil on his lips.The dwarf climbed stiffly to his feet, every joint aching . Must we play the same fool ’ s game with every meal? He made another grab for the beans.When the Knight of Flowers made his entrance, a murmur ran through the crowd, and he heard Sansa ’ s fervent whisper, Oh, he ’ s so beautiful . Ser Loras Tyrell was slender as a reed, dressed in a suit of fabulous silver armor polished to a blinding sheen and filigreed with twining black vines and tiny blue forget-me-nots . The commons realized in the same instant as Ned that the blue of the flowers came from sapphires; a gasp went up from a thousand throats . Across the boy ’ s shoulders his cloak hung heavy . It was woven of forget-me-nots, real ones, hundreds of fresh blooms sewn to a heavy woolen cape.Lord Tywin seated himself . You have the right of it about Stark . Alive, we might have used Lord Eddard to forge a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, a peace that would have given us the time we need to deal with Robert ’ s brothers . Dead … His hand curled into a fist . Madness . Rank madness.It won ’ t be so bad, Sansa, Arya said . We ’ re going to sail on a galley . It will be an adventure, and then we ’ ll be with Bran and Robb again, and Old Nan and Hodor and the rest . She touched her on the arm.He did not hate her, Sansa realized; neither did he love her . He felt nothing for her at all . She was only a … a thing to him . No, she said, rising . She wanted to rage, to hurt him as he ’ d hurt her, to warn him that when she was queen she would have him exiled if he ever dared strike her again … but she remembered what the Hound had told her, so all she said was, I shall do whatever His Grace commands.Sorry, my lord, the messenger said . Lord Brax was clad in plate-and-mail when his raft overturned . He was very gallant.I told Petyr our suspicions about Jon Arryn ’ s death, Catelyn said . He has promised to help you find the truth.Past time, the traitor . The man spat.Pretty, said a woman ’ s voice . She scarcely looked like a woman; tall and lean, with the same hard face as the others, her hair hidden beneath a bowl-shaped halfhelm . The spear she held was eight feet of black oak, tipped in rusted steel.Littlefinger winced . My lord, step over here to the window, if you would be so kind.It was the last thing in the world he wanted.You rotten! Arya shrieked . She flew at her sister like an arrow, knocking Sansa down to the ground, pummeling her . Liar, liar, liar, liar.No, Dany said meekly.Nothing holds an edge like Valyrian steel, Littlefinger said as Varys sucked at his bleeding thumb and looked at Catelyn with sullen admonition . Littlefinger hefted the knife lightly in his hand, testing the grip . He flipped it in the air, caught it again with his other hand . Such sweet balance . You want to find the owner, is that the reason for this visit? You have no need of Ser Aron for that, my lady . You should have come to me.I want no courtesies either, Mormont said, so thank me no thanks . Honor the steel with deeds, not words.But now there was no more time.Ned had heard enough . You send hired knives to kill a fourteen-year-old girl and still quibble about honor? He pushed back his chair and stood . Do it yourself, Robert . The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword . Look her in the eyes before you kill her . See her tears, hear her last words . You owe her that much at least.Arya did not want to leave him, but he had taught her to do as he said . Swift as a deer, she whispered.One day, Bran, you will be Robb ’ s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to you . When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away . A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.Robert nodded, wiping tears from his eyes . Cousins . Sons of Lord Tywin ’ s brother . One of the dead ones . Or perhaps the live one, now that I come to think on it . I don ’ t recall . My wife comes from a very large family, Ned.Jon observed . [BOS] A shade more exhausting than needlework, [EOS] Where is my sister? Viserys shouted, his voice thick with wine . I ’ ve come for her feast . How dare you presume to eat without me? No one eats before the king . Where is she? The whore can ’ t hide from the dragon.Qotho ’ s lips skinned back from his crooked brown teeth in a terrible mockery of a smile . No? You say me no? Better you should pray that we do not stake you out beside your maegi . You did this, as much as the other.No, Catelyn said . We will need your counsel . She threw back the furs and climbed from the bed . The night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as she padded across the room.Oh, dreadful, murmured Varys . How cruel can men be?Yet even as they were bundling him outside, saddling the horses in the rain, and tying his hands with a length of coarse rope, Tyrion Lannister was not truly afraid . They would never get him to Winterfell, he would have given odds on that . Riders would be after them within the day, birds would take wing, and surely one of the river lords would want to curry favor with his father enough to take a hand . Tyrion was congratulating himself on his subtlety when someone pulled a hood down over his eyes and lifted him up onto a saddle.Something in Robb ’ s tone troubled her . She smoothed out the paper and read . Concern gave way to disbelief, then to anger, and lastly to fear . This is Cersei ’ s letter, not your sister ’ s, she said when she was done . The real message is in what Sansa does not say . All this about how kindly and gently the Lannisters are treating her … I know the sound of a threat, even whispered . They have Sansa hostage, and they mean to keep her.As you wish, the maester said.The king still wore his boots . Ned could see dried mud and blades of grass clinging to the leather where Robert ’ s feet stuck out beneath the blanket that covered him . A green doublet lay on the floor, slashed open and discarded, the cloth crusted with red-brown stains . The room smelled of smoke and blood and death.No, Sansa began . She looked for Septa Mordane, and was startled to find her with her head on the table, snoring soft and ladylike snores . I mean to say … yes, thank you, that would be most kind . I am tired, and the way is so dark . I should be glad for some protection.Ser Vardis held out a gauntleted hand, and his squire placed a handsome double-edged longsword in his grasp . The blade was engraved with a delicate silver tracery of a mountain sky; its pommel was a falcon ’ s head, its crossguard fashioned into the shape of wings . I had that sword crafted for Jon in King ’ s Landing, Lysa told her guests proudly as they watched Ser Vardis try a practice cut . He wore it whenever he sat the Iron Throne in King Robert ’ s place . Isn ’ t it a lovely thing? I thought it only fitting that our champion avenge Jon with his own blade.I have done everything I can for Bran, she said, laying a wounded hand on his arm . His life is in the hands of the gods and Maester Luwin . As you reminded me yourself, Robb, I have other children to think of now.Sansa had eyes only for Joffrey . He must listen to me, he must, she thought . The king shifted on his seat . Let her speak, he commanded . I want to hear what she says.Aggo accepted the bow with lowered eyes . I cannot say these words . Only a man can lead a khalasar or name a ko.Ned tried a swallow . Dregs . He felt as though he were about to bring the wine back up.My lord, no, an urgent voice called out . He speaks the truth . There were footsteps behind him.I ’ m trying, the crow replied . Say, got any corn?She took a step toward him, her face tight . And what does that mean, Lannister?Asshai, I would say . It lies far to the south, at the end of the known world, yet men say it is a great port . We will find a ship to take us back to Pentos . It will be a hard journey, make no mistake . Do you trust your khas? Will they come with us?My lord father, for one . He ’ s put me in the van.A few cuts, Ser Jorah answered, nothing of consequence . He slew two khals this day . Khal Ogo first, and then the son, Fogo, who became khal when Ogo fell . His bloodriders cut the bells from their hair, and now Khal Drogo ’ s every step rings louder than before.Jon had started drinking then, and he had not stopped.Dany could not have said why the city needed a gate when it had no walls … and no buildings that she could see . Yet there it stood, immense and beautiful, the great horses framing the distant purple mountain beyond . The bronze stallions threw long shadows across the waving grasses as Khal Drogo led the khalasar under their hooves and down the godsway, his bloodriders beside him.Who are you? Arya asked.He heard the screams of frightened horses and the crash of metal on metal . Chiggen ’ s sword raked across the naked face of a mailed rider, and Bronn plunged through the clansmen like a whirlwind, cutting down foes right and left . Ser Rodrik hammered at the big man in the shadowskin cloak, their horses dancing round each other as they traded blow for blow . Jyck vaulted onto a horse and galloped bareback into the fray . Tyrion saw an arrow sprout from the throat of the man in the shadowskin cloak . When he opened his mouth to scream, only blood came out . By the time he fell, Ser Rodrik was fighting someone else.It was queer how sometimes a child ’ s innocent eyes can see things that grown men are blind to . Someday, when Sansa was grown, he would have to tell her how she had made it all come clear for him . He ’ s not the least bit like that old drunken king, she had declared, angry and unknowing, and the simple truth of it had twisted inside him, cold as death . This was the sword that killed Jon Arryn, Ned thought then, and it will kill Robert as well, a slower death but full as certain . Shattered legs may heal in time, but some betrayals fester and poison the soul.Don ’ t trouble yourself, Father, I ’ ve acquired a few of my own . He tried a swallow of the ale . It was brown and yeasty, so thick you could almost chew it . Very fine, in truth . A pity his father had hanged the innkeep . How is your war going?Past certain, Lord Mormont, Tyrion replied . My brother Jaime will be wondering what has become of me . He may decide that you have convinced me to take the black.Ned nodded . The gods help this potboy if he ’ s sent me off haring after shadows . It was a slim enough staff to lean on, but the Jon Arryn that Ned Stark had known was not one to wear jeweled and silvered plate . Steel was steel; it was meant for protection, not ornament . He might have changed his views, to be sure . He would scarcely have been the first man who came to look on things differently after a few years at court … but the change was marked enough to make Ned wonder.Dead Othor slammed into him, knocking him off his feet.Jon told him . The boy who had his arm jerked upward on him, hard . Pain lanced through him, but Jon would not cry out . [BOS] You looked bad before I ever met you, [EOS] The boy insists it ’ s true . The Hand took three guardsmen with him, and the boy says they were joking of it when he took their horses afterward.The direwolves stopped, turned their heads . Grey Wind loped back to Robb . Summer stayed where he was, his eyes on Bran and the man beside him . He growled . His muzzle was wet and red, but his eyes burned.Is beans, Mord said . Here . He held out the plate.To her credit, Cersei did not look away . He saw us . You love your children, do you not?She looked so pleased with herself, Tyrion thought, and small wonder . How could a trial threaten her, when her weakling son was the lord judge? Tyrion glanced at her Moon Door . Mother, I want to see him fly! the boy had said . How many men had the snot-nosed little wretch sent through that door already?If you can spare a few of your swords, I need some men to escort two of Lord Frey ’ s grandsons north to Winterfell, she told him . I have agreed to take them as wards . They are young boys, aged eight years and seven . It would seem they are both named Walder . Your brother Bran will welcome the companionship of lads near his own age, I should think.A thick stone parapet protected the outer edge of the rampart, reaching as high as Sansa ’ s chin, with crenellations cut into it every five feet for archers . The heads were mounted between the crenels, along the top of the wall, impaled on iron spikes so they faced out over the city . Sansa had noted them the moment she ’ d stepped out onto the wallwalk, but the river and the bustling streets and the setting sun were ever so much prettier . He can make me look at the heads, she told herself, but he can ’ t make me see them.Braziers were lit . Mirri Maz Duur tossed a red powder onto the coals . It gave the smoke a spicy scent, a pleasant enough smell, yet Eroeh fled sobbing, and Dany was filled with fear . But she had gone too far to turn back now . She sent her handmaids away . Go with them, Silver Lady, Mirri Maz Duur told her.I see you have taken a few lessons from me.No, Dany said . Please . Please.Go with them, she commanded Ser Jorah.I ’ ll take Summer, Bran argued.Don ’ t let me keep you from your eels, my lord, Ned said with icy disdain . At the moment, I cannot think of anyone whose company I desire less than yours.The wind tugged at his blanket with gusts sharp as talons . His cell was miserably small, even for a dwarf . Not five feet away, where a wall ought to have been, where a wall would be in a proper dungeon, the floor ended and the sky began . He had plenty of fresh air and sunshine, and the moon and stars by night, but Tyrion would have traded it all in an instant for the dankest, gloomiest pit in the bowels of the Casterly Rock.I didn ’ t go out the gates, she blurted . Well, I didn ’ t mean to . I was down in the dungeons, only they turned into this tunnel . It was all dark, and I didn ’ t have a torch or a candle to see by, so I had to follow . I couldn ’ t go back the way I came on account of the monsters . Father, they were talking about killing you! Not the monsters, the two men . They didn ’ t see me, I was being still as stone and quiet as a shadow, but I heard them . They said you had a book and a bastard and if one Hand could die, why not a second? Is that the book? Jon ’ s the bastard, I bet.When he opened his eyes again, Lord Eddard Stark was alone with his dead . His horse moved closer, caught the rank scent of blood, and galloped away . Ned began to drag himself through the mud, gritting his teeth at the agony in his leg . It seemed to take years . Faces watched from candlelit windows, and people began to emerge from alleys and doors, but no one moved to help.We want to cross, Catelyn told him.Robb, Sansa said.Catelyn was shaking . It was the grief, the cold, the howling of the direwolves . Night after night, the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle, on and on they went, never changing, and her boy lying there broken, the sweetest of her children, the gentlest, Bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt of knighthood, all gone now, she would never hear him laugh again . Sobbing, she pulled her hand free of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls . Make them stop! she cried . I can ’ t stand it, make them stop, make them stop, kill them all if you must, just make them stop!This was no god ’ s work, Dany said coldly . If I look back I am lost . You cheated me . You murdered my child within me.Oh, yes, I confess it . And you would have rushed straight to the king, yes? And when Robert heard of his peril, what would he have done? I wonder.Tyrion . Bronn ’ s warning was low and urgent.Men of the Watch! Janos Slynt shouted, donning his helm . A hundred gold cloaks leveled their spears and closed.Eight, the queen corrected . Tregar died this morning, of the blow Lord Stark gave him.He was a traitor . I never promised to spare him, only that I ’ d be merciful, and I was . If he hadn ’ t been your father, I would have had him torn or flayed, but I gave him a clean death.Lannister studied his face . Yes, he said . I can see it . You have more of the north in you than your brothers.I ’ ll get you with child as soon as you ’ re able, Joffrey said as he escorted her across the practice yard . If the first one is stupid, I ’ ll chop off your head and find a smarter wife . When do you think you ’ ll be able to have children?He found a comfortable spot just beyond the noise of the camp, beside a swift-running stream with waters clear and cold as ice . A grotesquely ancient oak provided shelter from the biting wind . Tyrion curled up in his fur with his back against the trunk, took a sip of the wine, and began to read about the properties of dragonbone . Dragonbone is black because of its high iron content, the book told him . It is strong as steel, yet lighter and far more flexible, and of course utterly impervious to fire . Dragonbone bows are greatly prized by the Dothraki, and small wonder . An archer so armed can outrange any wooden bow.She must have crept after them for miles . Finally they were gone, but there was no place to go but forward . She found the wall again and followed, blind and lost, pretending that Nymeria was padding along beside her in the darkness . At the end she was knee-deep in foul-smelling water, wishing she could dance upon it as Syrio might have, and wondering if she ’ d ever see light again . It was full dark when finally Arya emerged into the night air.Inside, Catelyn was waiting . She cried out when she saw him, ran to him, and embraced him fiercely.Ser Kevan Lannister, his father ’ s only surviving brother, was sharing a flagon of ale with Lord Tywin when Tyrion entered the common room . His uncle was portly and balding, with a close-cropped yellow beard that followed the line of his massive jaw . Ser Kevan saw him first . Tyrion, he said in surprise.Ser Jorah said the people of this country named themselves the Lhazareen, but the Dothraki called them haesh rakhi, the Lamb Men . Once Dany might have taken them for Dothraki, for they had the same copper skin and almond-shaped eyes . Now they looked alien to her, squat and flat-faced, their black hair cropped unnaturally short . They were herders of sheep and eaters of vegetables, and Khal Drogo said they belonged south of the river bend . The grass of the Dothraki sea was not meant for sheep.It is, my lord, Ser Jaremy said . It will be done.Catelyn Stark spoke first . You wish to confess your crimes, we are told.The left side of his face was a ruin . His ear had been burned away; there was nothing left but a hole . His eye was still good, but all around it was a twisted mass of scar, slick black flesh hard as leather, pocked with craters and fissured by deep cracks that gleamed red and wet when he moved . Down by his jaw, you could see a hint of bone where the flesh had been seared away.You wound me, Chella, Tyrion said . Here I thought we had become such friends . But as you will . You shall ride with me, and Shagga and Conn for the Stone Crows, Ulf for the Moon Brothers, and Timett son of Timett for the Burned Men . The clansmen exchanged wary looks as he named them . The rest shall wait here until I send for you . Try not to kill and maim each other while I ’ m gone.Robert snorted . Bogs and forests and fields, and scarcely a decent inn north of the Neck . I ’ ve never seen such a vast emptiness . Where are all your people?He saw us, the woman said shrilly.The day was warm and cloudless, the sky a deep blue . When the wind blew, she could smell the rich scents of grass and earth . As her litter passed beneath the stolen monuments, she went from sunlight to shadow and back again . Dany swayed along, studying the faces of dead heroes and forgotten kings . She wondered if the gods of burned cities could still answer prayers.My lady, said Maester Luwin, is that wise? Surely the Lannisters would greet your arrival with suspicion.And yet you gave the turnkey a purse of gold, Bronn said.His quarry met him sword in hand . He was tall and spare, wearing a long chainmail hauberk and gauntlets of lobstered steel, but he ’ d lost his helm and blood ran down into his eyes from a gash across his forehead . Tyrion aimed a swipe at his face, but the tall man slammed it aside . Dwarf, he screamed . Die . He turned in a circle as Tyrion rode around him, hacking at his head and shoulders . Steel rang on steel, and Tyrion soon realized that the tall man was quicker and stronger than he was . Where in the seven hells was Bronn? Die, the man grunted, chopping at him savagely . Tyrion barely got his shield up in time, and the wood seemed to explode inward under the force of the blow . The shattered pieces fell away from his arm . Die! the swordsman bellowed, shoving in close and whanging Tyrion across the temple so hard his head rang . The blade made a hideous scraping sound as he drew it back over the steel . The tall man grinned … until Tyrion ’ s destrier bit, quick as a snake, laying his cheek bare to the bone . Then he screamed . Tyrion buried his axe in his head . You die, he told him, and he did.She nodded . Tomorrow we ’ re going to catch cats.They had done what they could to close him up, but it was nowhere near enough . The boar must have been a fearsome thing . It had ripped the king from groin to nipple with its tusks . The wine-soaked bandages that Grand Maester Pycelle had applied were already black with blood, and the smell off the wound was hideous . Ned ’ s stomach turned . He let the blanket fall.A wife is allowed to yearn for her husband, and if a mother needs her daughters close, who can tell her no?Jon lowered his eyes . She was cradling one of Bran ’ s hands . He took the other, squeezed it . Fingers like the bones of birds . [BOS] Good-bye, [EOS] he said.He missed his true brothers: little Rickon, bright eyes shining as he begged for a sweet; Robb, his rival and best friend and constant companion; Bran, stubborn and curious, always wanting to follow and join in whatever Jon and Robb were doing . He missed the girls too, even Sansa, who never called him anything but my half brother since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant . And Arya … he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes, so fierce and willful . Arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had … yet she could always make Jon smile . He would give anything to be with her now, to muss up her hair once more and watch her make a face, to hear her finish a sentence with him.It was all Jon could do to stop himself from walking out . Was he supposed to churn butter and sew doublets like a girl for the rest of his days? May I go? he asked stiffly.Or dead . Buried with his king . Ah, Robert, he murmured as his groping hand touched a cold stone wall, his leg throbbing with every motion . He remembered the jest the king had shared in the crypts of Winterfell, as the Kings of Winter looked on with cold stone eyes . The king eats, Robert had said, and the Hand takes the shit . How he had laughed . Yet he had gotten it wrong . The king dies, Ned Stark thought, and the Hand is buried.He came for Bran, Catelyn said . He kept muttering how I wasn ’ t supposed to be there . He set the library fire thinking I would rush to put it out, taking any guards with me . If I hadn ’ t been half-mad with grief, it would have worked.Half a man I may be, Tyrion said, yet I have the courage to face my enemies . What do the Stone Crows do, but hide behind rocks and shiver with fear as the knights of the Vale ride by?By then Ser Gregor Clegane was in position at the head of the lists . He was huge, the biggest man that Eddard Stark had ever seen . Robert Baratheon and his brothers were all big men, as was the Hound, and back at Winterfell there was a simpleminded stableboy named Hodor who dwarfed them all, but the knight they called the Mountain That Rides would have towered over Hodor . He was well over seven feet tall, closer to eight, with massive shoulders and arms thick as the trunks of small trees . His destrier seemed a pony in between his armored legs, and the lance he carried looked as small as a broom handle.A series of chisel-cut handholds made a ladder in the granite of the tower ’ s inner wall . Hodor hummed tunelessly as he went down hand under hand, Bran bouncing against his back in the wicker seat that Maester Luwin had fashioned for him . Luwin had gotten the idea from the baskets the women used to carry firewood on their backs; after that it had been a simple matter of cutting legholes and attaching some new straps to spread Bran ’ s weight more evenly . It was not as good as riding Dancer, but there were places Dancer could not go, and this did not shame Bran the way it did when Hodor carried him in his arms like a baby . Hodor seemed to like it too, though with Hodor it was hard to tell . The only tricky part was doors . Sometimes Hodor forgot that he had Bran on his back, and that could be painful when he went through a door.Arya cocked her head to one side . Can I be a king ’ s councillor and build castles and become the High Septon?The Lord Commander is not accustomed to waiting, was Ser Alliser ’ s reply . And I am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards.The servants rushed back in and hurried to feed the fires . The queen had gone; that was some small relief, at least . If she had any sense, Cersei would take her children and fly before the break of day, Ned thought . She had lingered too long already.Outside the tower, a wolf began to howl . Catelyn trembled, just for a second.A sense of dread closed around her heart . Go to him, she commanded Ser Jorah . Stop him . Bring him here . Tell him he can have the dragon ’ s eggs if that is what he wants . The knight rose swiftly to his feet.Mother? a small voice said . Lysa whirled, her heavy robe swirling around her . Robert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, stood in the doorway, clutching a ragged cloth doll and looking at them with large eyes . He was a painfully thin child, small for his age and sickly all his days, and from time to time he trembled . The shaking sickness, the maesters called it . I heard voices.You will . You found forty thousand golden dragons for a champion ’ s purse, surely you can scrape together a few coppers to keep the king ’ s peace . Ned turned back to Janos Slynt . I will also give you twenty good swords from my own household guard, to serve with the Watch until the crowds have left.Tommen is no less a Lannister, Ser Marq Piper snapped.The monsters were still there, but the fear was gone.Ned frowned . Would that I could . Lady Arryn took her household back to the Eyrie . Lysa had done him no favor in that regard . All those who had stood closest to her husband had gone with her when she fled: Jon ’ s maester, his steward, the captain of his guard, his knights and retainers.The lords of the Trident keep the king ’ s peace, Ser Raymun Darry said . The Lannisters have broken it . We ask leave to answer them, steel for steel . We ask justice for the smallfolk of Sherrer and Wendish Town and the Mummer ’ s Ford.Rickon needs you, Robb said sharply . He ’ s only three, he doesn ’ t understand what ’ s happening . He thinks everyone has deserted him, so he follows me around all day, clutching my leg and crying . I don ’ t know what to do with him . He paused a moment, chewing on his lower lip the way he ’ d done when he was little . Mother, I need you too . I ’ m trying but I can ’ t … I can ’ t do it all by myself . His voice broke with sudden emotion, and Catelyn remembered that he was only fourteen . She wanted to get up and go to him, but Bran was still holding her hand and she could not move.Jon said . He put a hand on Sam ’ s broad shoulder . [BOS] We ’ re not friends, We ’ re brothers . [EOS] Most of her household, Littlefinger said, not all . A few remain . A pregnant kitchen girl hastily wed to one of Lord Renly ’ s grooms, a stablehand who joined the City Watch, a potboy discharged from service for theft, and Lord Arryn ’ s squire.He crossed the outer yard, passed under a portcullis into the inner bailey, and was walking toward what he thought was the Tower of the Hand when Littlefinger appeared in front of him . You ’ re going the wrong way, Stark . Come with me.Know? Tyrion squatted awkwardly on his stunted legs to build the fire . I tossed the dice . Back at the inn, you and Chiggen helped take me captive . Why? The others saw it as their duty, for the honor of the lords they served, but not you two . You had no lord, no duty, and precious little honor, so why trouble to involve yourselves? He took out his knife and whittled some thin strips of bark off one of the sticks he ’ d gathered, to serve as kindling . Well, why do sellswords do anything? For gold . You were thinking Lady Catelyn would reward you for your help, perhaps even take you into her service . Here, that should do, I hope . Do you have a flint?Arya seemed puzzled at first . Then it came to her . She was that quick . They said it together:The saddle slipped from Arya ’ s fingers and fell to the dirt with a thump and a puff of dust . Could she find the room with the monsters again? She wasn ’ t certain, yet she knew she had to try.After Jaime had made his confession, to drive home the lesson, Lord Tywin brought my wife in and gave her to his guards . They paid her fair enough . A silver for each man, how many whores command that high a price? He sat me down in the corner of the barracks and bade me watch, and at the end she had so many silvers the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on the floor, she … The smoke was stinging his eyes . Tyrion cleared his throat and turned away from the fire, to gaze out into darkness . Lord Tywin had me go last, he said in a quiet voice . And he gave me a gold coin to pay her, because I was a Lannister, and worth more.At first it had not come easy . The khalasar had broken camp the morning after her wedding, moving east toward Vaes Dothrak, and by the third day Dany thought she was going to die . Saddle sores opened on her bottom, hideous and bloody . Her thighs were chafed raw, her hands blistered from the reins, the muscles of her legs and back so wracked with pain that she could scarcely sit . By the time dusk fell, her handmaids would need to help her down from her mount.The Others made no sound.Sometimes she thought about swimming the river, but the Blackwater Rush was wide and deep, and everyone agreed that its currents were wicked and treacherous . She had no coin to pay a ferryman or take passage on a ship.Notable achievements.Honors? Ned laughed bitterly.Jon nodded . He should have come straight from the stable . He climbed the tower steps briskly . He wants wine or a fire in his hearth, that ’ s all, he told himself.For a moment Ned was speechless with shock . Who?The Others take your pigeon, the pushcart man said.Ser Endrew? Jon did not know the name.I should like to hear them both, Sam admitted, but they would not want me there . His face was troubled . He ’ s going to make me fight again on the morrow, isn ’ t he?The direwolf must be a prickly beast, said Littlefinger with a sharp twist of his mouth.You let my father die, Joffrey said accusingly from atop the Iron Throne . You ’ re too old to protect anybody.Another ship? Ser Rodrik looked a shade green, yet he managed not to shudder . As you say, my lady.Their grandfather, old Lord Rickard, had gone as well, with his son Brandon who was Father ’ s brother, and two hundred of his best men . None had ever returned . And Father had gone south, with Arya and Sansa, and Jory and Hullen and Fat Tom and the rest, and later Mother and Ser Rodrik had gone, and they hadn ’ t come back either . And now Robb meant to go . Not to King ’ s Landing and not to swear fealty, but to Riverrun, with a sword in his hand . And if their lord father were truly a prisoner, that could mean his death for a certainty . It frightened Bran more than he could say.She giggled at him . It ’ s so skinny.The man who stepped through the door was plump, perfumed, powdered, and as hairless as an egg . He wore a vest of woven gold thread over a loose gown of purple silk, and on his feet were pointed slippers of soft velvet . Lady Stark, he said, taking her hand in both of his, to see you again after so many years is such a joy . His flesh was soft and moist, and his breath smelled of lilacs . Oh, your poor hands . Have you burned yourself, sweet lady? The fingers are so delicate … Our good Maester Pycelle makes a marvelous salve, shall I send for a jar?Magister Illyrio ’ s words were honey . Many important men will be at the feast tonight . Such men have enemies . The khal must protect his guests, yourself chief among them, Your Grace . No doubt the Usurper would pay well for your head.No, Bran blurted . I can ’ t …Furious, Qotho wheeled his stallion around and galloped off in anger … but Dany knew he would return with Mirri Maz Duur, however little he might like it . The slaves erected Khal Drogo ’ s tent beneath a jagged outcrop of black rock whose shadow gave some relief from the heat of the afternoon sun . Even so, it was stifling under the sandsilk as Irri and Doreah helped Dany walk Drogo inside . Thick patterned carpets had been laid down over the ground, and pillows scattered in the corners . Eroeh, the timid girl Dany had rescued outside the mud walls of the Lamb Men, set up a brazier . They stretched Drogo out on a woven mat . No, he muttered in the Common Tongue . No, no . It was all he said, all he seemed capable of saying.I don ’ t know, Halder admitted . A sound, I thought it might have been a horse but …The scabbard was soft grey leather, supple as sin . Jon drew out the blade slowly, so she could see the deep blue sheen of the steel . This is no toy, he told her . Be careful you don ’ t cut yourself . The edges are sharp enough to shave with.Stop it! the boy screamed . He took a step forward, his hands coiling into fists, close to tears.The common people pray for rain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends, Ser Jorah told her . It is no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones, so long as they are left in peace . He gave a shrug . They never are.Afterward she could not say how far or how long they had ridden, but it was full dark when they stopped at a grassy place beside a small stream . Drogo swung off his horse and lifted her down from hers . She felt as fragile as glass in his hands, her limbs as weak as water . She stood there helpless and trembling in her wedding silks while he secured the horses, and when he turned to look at her, she began to cry.Ned knew better than to defy him when the wrath was on him . If the years had not quenched Robert ’ s thirst for revenge, no words of his would help . You can ’ t get your hands on this one, can you? he said quietly.You took a wound from Rhaegar, Ned reminded him . So when the Targaryen host broke and ran, you gave the pursuit into my hands . The remnants of Rhaegar ’ s army fled back to King ’ s Landing . We followed . Aerys was in the Red Keep with several thousand loyalists . I expected to find the gates closed to us.Queer? Pyp was all curiosity . How queer?Ned turned off the square where the Street of Steel began and followed its winding path up a long hill, past blacksmiths working at open forges, freeriders haggling over mail shirts, and grizzled ironmongers selling old blades and razors from their wagons . The farther they climbed, the larger the buildings grew . The man they wanted was all the way at the top of the hill, in a huge house of timber and plaster whose upper stories loomed over the narrow street . The double doors showed a hunting scene carved in ebony and weirwood . A pair of stone knights stood sentry at the entrance, armored in fanciful suits of polished red steel that transformed them into griffin and unicorn . Ned left his horse with Jacks and shouldered his way inside.The words twisted in Ned ’ s belly like a knife . For a moment he was at a loss . He could not bring himself to lie . Then he remembered the bastards: little Barra at her mother ’ s breast, Mya in the Vale, Gendry at his forge, and all the others . I shall … guard your children as if they were my own, he said slowly.Us? Cersei seemed puzzled.Darkness, Dany thought . The terrible darkness sweeping up behind to devour her . If she looked back she was lost . My son was alive and strong when Ser Jorah carried me into this tent, she said . I could feel him kicking, fighting to be born.Sansa backed away from them . I did as the queen asked, I wrote the letters, I wrote what she told me . You promised you ’ d be merciful . Please, let me go home . I won ’ t do any treason, I ’ ll be good, I swear it, I don ’ t have traitor ’ s blood, I don ’ t . I only want to go home . Remembering her courtesies, she lowered her head . As it please you, she finished weakly.For death . Gently Ned covered the boy with his cloak, a bloodstained bit of blue bordered in crescent moons . When his mother asked why her son was dead, he reflected bitterly, they would tell her he had fought to honor the King ’ s Hand, Eddard Stark . This was needless . War should not be a game . Ned turned to the woman beside the cart, shrouded in grey, face hidden but for her eyes . The silent sisters prepared men for the grave, and it was ill fortune to look on the face of death . Send his armor home to the Vale . The mother will want to have it.Tell them I do not wish him harmed, Dany said.Do it, then, Khal Drogo commanded.There is no limit to Lannister pride or Lannister ambition, Catelyn said.A low thrum came from the woods behind them . Stiv gave a choked gasp as a half foot of razor-tipped broadhead suddenly exploded out of his chest . The arrow was bright red, as if it had been painted in blood.Here? Haggo looked around them . The land was brown and sere, inhospitable . This is no camping ground.Catelyn touched his arm . We are here, Ser Rodrik, and safely . That is all that truly matters . Her hand groped beneath her cloak, her fingers stiff and fumbling . The dagger was still at her side . She found she had to touch it now and then, to reassure herself . Now we must reach the king ’ s master-at-arms, and pray that he can be trusted.He remembered Robb as he had last seen him, standing in the yard with snow melting in his auburn hair . Jon would have to come to him in secret, disguised . He tried to imagine the look on Robb ’ s face when he revealed himself . His brother would shake his head and smile, and he ’ d say … he ’ d say …And two days later, as a red dawn broke across a windswept sky, Bran found himself in the yard beneath the gatehouse, strapped atop Dancer as he said his farewells to his brother.You disappoint me, Sansa, the queen said, with eyes gone hard as stones . We ’ ve told you of your father ’ s crimes . If you are truly as loyal as you say, why should you want to see him?Bring him in, damn it . There was a grunt and a loud groaning of wood as the cage slid sideways and then the Wall was beneath him . Tyrion waited until the swinging had stopped before he pushed open the cage door and hopped down onto the ice . A heavy figure in black was leaning on the winch, while a second held the cage with a gloved hand . Their faces were muffled in woolen scarves so only their eyes showed, and they were plump with layers of wool and leather, black on black . And what will you be wanting, this time of night? the one by the winch asked.You will drink, Dany said, cold as ice . Empty the cup, or I will tell them to hold you down while Ser Jorah pours the whole cask down your throat.Jon forced himself to smile back . [BOS] It was always my color . How long do you think it will be? [EOS] Jon tried to shout, but his voice was gone . Staggering to his feet, he kicked the arm away and snatched the lamp from the Old Bear ’ s fingers . The flame flickered and almost died . Burn! the raven cawed . Burn, burn, burn!When at last the sun was low in the sky, Khal Drogo clapped his hands together, and the drums and the shouting and feasting came to a sudden halt . Drogo stood and pulled Dany to her feet beside him . It was time for her bride gifts.You are too hard on yourself, Ned . You always were . Damn it, no woman wants Baelor the Blessed in her bed . He slapped a hand on his knee . Well, I ’ ll not press you if you feel so strong about it, though I swear, at times you ’ re so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil.Well and good, said Mormont . You may take your vows here at evenfall, before Septon Celladar and the first of your order . Do any of you keep to the old gods?Her stick sword whistled out and caught it two feet off the ground, and it went down in a flurry of brown feathers . She was on it in the blink of an eye, grabbing a wing as the pigeon flapped and fluttered . It pecked at her hand . She grabbed its neck and twisted until she felt the bone snap.As they were bound to Aerys Targaryen ’ s, Ned pointed out.I was eight when my father sent me to foster at the Eyrie, Ned said . Ser Rodrik tells me there is bad feeling between Robb and Prince Joffrey . That is not healthy . Bran can bridge that distance . He is a sweet boy, quick to laugh, easy to love . Let him grow up with the young princes, let him become their friend as Robert became mine . Our House will be the safer for it.They rode out together as the stars came out, leaving the khalasar and the grass palaces behind . Khal Drogo spoke no word to her, but drove his stallion at a hard trot through the gathering dusk . The tiny silver bells in his long braid rang softly as he rode . I am the blood of the dragon, she whispered aloud as she followed, trying to keep her courage up . I am the blood of the dragon . I am the blood of the dragon . The dragon was never afraid.Yet they were bound to Drogo for life and death, so Daenerys had no choice but to accept them . And sometimes she found herself wishing her father had been protected by such men . In the songs, the white knights of the Kingsguard were ever noble, valiant, and true, and yet King Aerys had been murdered by one of them, the handsome boy they now called the Kingslayer, and a second, Ser Barristan the Bold, had gone over to the Usurper . She wondered if all men were as false in the Seven Kingdoms . When her son sat the Iron Throne, she would see that he had bloodriders of his own to protect him against treachery in his Kingsguard.Ser Jorah grimaced . Would that I knew how.I ’ m here, Father, she said . With Robb, my son . He ’ ll want to see you too.I wasn ’ t playing, Arya insisted . I hate Septa Mordane.That would boil them, to be sure . Oh, to be sure . Now, what do you want to say?On the morrow, Ned said . When I am stronger . He could not face Robert now . The dream had left him weak as a kitten.Perhaps I ’ d best charge you with burying our dead, Tyrion, Lord Tywin said . If you are as late to battle as you are to table, the fighting will all be done by the time you arrive.Harwin had the door when Ned returned to the Tower of the Hand . Summon Jory to my chambers and tell your father to saddle my horse, Ned told him, too brusquely.She had sensed the truth of it long ago, Dany thought as she took a step closer to the conflagration, but the brazier had not been hot enough . The flames writhed before her like the women who had danced at her wedding, whirling and singing and spinning their yellow and orange and crimson veils, fearsome to behold, yet lovely, so lovely, alive with heat . Dany opened her arms to them, her skin flushed and glowing . This is a wedding, too, she thought . Mirri Maz Duur had fallen silent . The godswife thought her a child, but children grow, and children learn.What could you want to see? Sansa said, annoyed . She had been thrilled by the invitation, and her stupid sister was going to ruin everything, just as she ’ d feared . It ’ s all just fields and farms and holdfasts.You ’ re Ned Stark ’ s bastard, aren ’ t you?The stewards! For a moment Jon could not believe what he had heard . Mormont must have read it wrong . He started to rise, to open his mouth, to tell them there had been a mistake … and then he saw Ser Alliser studying him, eyes shiny as two flakes of obsidian, and he knew.Ned Stark thought of pale blue roses, and for a moment he wanted to weep . I do not know which of you I pity most.Bran ’ s cloak billowed out, rippling in the wind, and the snow seemed to rush at his face . Robb was well ahead, glancing back over his shoulder from time to time to make sure Bran and the others were following . He snapped the reins again . Smooth as silk, Dancer slid into a gallop . The distance closed . By the time he caught Robb on the edge of the wolfswood, two miles beyond the winter town, they had left the others well behind . I can ride! Bran shouted, grinning . It felt almost as good as flying.They found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon still mounted beside him . The late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn . Robb stood knee-deep in white, his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair . He was cradling something in his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited voices.I see . His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall . My brother does not seem very festive tonight.She liked that less well . Without Bronn she would never have reached the Vale, she knew; the sellsword was as fierce a fighter as she had ever seen, and his sword had helped cut them through to safety . Yet for all that, Catelyn misliked the man . Courage he had, and strength, but there was no kindness in him, and little loyalty . And she had seen him riding beside Lannister far too often, talking in low voices and laughing at some private joke . She would have preferred to separate him from the dwarf here and now, but having agreed that Marillion might continue to the Eyrie, she could see no gracious way to deny that same right to Bronn . As you wish, she said, although she noted that he had not actually asked her permission.The horse, he answered at once . Again like his father; Ned would always take the more dangerous task himself.For a start, said Ned, I do not kill children . You would do well to listen, my lady . I shall say this only once . When the king returns from his hunt, I intend to lay the truth before him . You must be gone by then . You and your children, all three, and not to Casterly Rock . If I were you, I should take ship for the Free Cities, or even farther, to the Summer Isles or the Port of Ibben . As far as the winds blow.On a hill overlooking the kingsroad, a long trestle table of rough-hewn pine had been erected beneath an elm tree and covered with a golden cloth . There, beside his pavilion, Lord Tywin took his evening meal with his chief knights and lords bannermen, his great crimson-and-gold standard waving overhead from a lofty pike.Only the crones of the dosh khaleen dwell permanently in the sacred city, them and their slaves and servants, Ser Jorah replied, yet Vaes Dothrak is large enough to house every man of every khalasar, should all the khals return to the Mother at once . The crones have prophesied that one day that will come to pass, and so Vaes Dothrak must be ready to embrace all its children.Never has a king been so beloved as our Robert, quipped Littlefinger . He smiled slyly . At least in Lord Varys ’ s hearing.Drogo was silent for a time . Finally he said, This seller of poisons ran from the moon of my life . Better he should run after her . So he will . Jhogo, Jorah the Andal, to each of you I say, choose any horse you wish from my herds, and it is yours . Any horse save my red and the silver that was my bride gift to the moon of my life . I make this gift to you for what you did.We saw Uncle Benjen when the king came to visit, Robb pointed out . Jon will visit too, you ’ ll see.Do you consent?These are tourney lances, he told his daughter . They make them to splinter on impact, so no one is hurt . Yet he remembered the dead boy in the cart with his cloak of crescent moons, and the words were raw in his throat.His father ignored the sally . The honor of our House was at stake . I had no choice but to ride . No man sheds Lannister blood with impunity.Mord grunted . The strap whistled through the air and smashed Tyrion full in the face . The pain was so bad he did not remember falling, but when he opened his eyes again he was on the floor of his cell . His ear was ringing, and his mouth was full of blood . He groped for purchase, to push himself up, and his fingers brushed against … nothing . Tyrion snatched his hand back as fast as if it had been scalded, and tried his best to stop breathing . He had fallen right on the edge, inches from the blue.Catelyn shifted uneasily in her seat . The dwarf is here, and not by choice . Chains or no, he is my prisoner . Lysa will want him to answer for his crimes no less than I . It was her own lord husband the Lannisters murdered, and her own letter that first warned us against them.And tell him I ’ ve not been with no one else . I swear it, milord, by the old gods and new . Chataya said I could have half a year, for the baby, and for hoping he ’ d come back . So you ’ ll tell him I ’ m waiting, won ’ t you? I don ’ t want no jewels or nothing, just him . He was always good to me, truly.Jaime Lannister was back on his feet, but his ornate lion helmet had been twisted around and dented in his fall, and now he could not get it off . The commons were hooting and pointing, the lords and ladies were trying to stifle their chuckles, and failing, and over it all Ned could hear King Robert laughing, louder than anyone . Finally they had to lead the Lion of Lannister off to a blacksmith, blind and stumbling.It was her fate, Khaleesi, said Aggo.Sansa began to cry . He let go of her then, and snuffed out the torch in the dirt . No pretty words for that, girl? No little compliment the septa taught you? When there was no answer, he continued . Most of them, they think it was some battle . A siege, a burning tower, an enemy with a torch . One fool asked if it was dragonsbreath . His laugh was softer this time, but just as bitter . I ’ ll tell you what it was, girl, he said, a voice from the night, a shadow leaning so close now that she could smell the sour stench of wine on his breath . I was younger than you, six, maybe seven . A woodcarver set up shop in the village under my father ’ s keep, and to buy favor he sent us gifts . The old man made marvelous toys . I don ’ t remember what I got, but it was Gregor ’ s gift I wanted . A wooden knight, all painted up, every joint pegged separate and fixed with strings, so you could make him fight . Gregor is five years older than me, the toy was nothing to him, he was already a squire, near six foot tall and muscled like an ox . So I took his knight, but there was no joy to it, I tell you . I was scared all the while, and true enough, he found me . There was a brazier in the room . Gregor never said a word, just picked me up under his arm and shoved the side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while I screamed and screamed . You saw how strong he is . Even then, it took three grown men to drag him off me . The septons preach about the seven hells . What do they know? Only a man who ’ s been burned knows what hell is truly like.If they come again, we ’ ll use their blood to water the fields they burnt, Ser Marq Piper declared hotly.Just to be sure, Catelyn paid the oarmen herself, a stag to each man, and a copper to the two men who carried their chests halfway up Visenya ’ s hill to the inn that Moreo had suggested . It was a rambling old place on Eel Alley . The woman who owned it was a sour crone with a wandering eye who looked them over suspiciously and bit the coin that Catelyn offered her to make sure it was real . Her rooms were large and airy, though, and Moreo swore that her fish stew was the most savory in all the Seven Kingdoms . Best of all, she had no interest in their names.Ser Rodrik protested . My lady, let me accompany you at least . The kingsroad can be perilous for a woman alone.Illyrio gave a massive shrug . You have waited most of your life, great king . What is another few months, another few years?If I did, my word would be as hollow as an empty suit of armor . My life is not so precious to me as that.Trout, he thought . Suckling pig . Damn my father . He stared mournfully at the bones, his belly rumbling.Yet now the banners that flew from its battlements were golden, not black, and where the three-headed dragon had once breathed fire, now pranced the crowned stag of House Baratheon.Ser Jorah is now in Pentos, anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow him to return from exile, Robert explained . Lord Varys makes good use of him.You ’ re asking a lame man to teach a cripple how to dance, Tyrion said . However sincere the lesson, the result is likely to be grotesque . Still, I know what it is to love a brother, Lord Snow . I will give Bran whatever small help is in my power.So you are . Robb sounded sad, and even a little scared . Bran, I need to tell you something . There was a bird last night . From King ’ s Landing . Maester Luwin woke me.Jon ’ s fingers were in the bucket, blood up to the wrist . [BOS] Dywen says the wildlings call us crows, [EOS] he said uncertainly.Ned looked shocked . He asked to join the Night ’ s Watch?That ’ s not how it was, Arya said, close to tears again . Ned put a hand on her shoulder.If it please you, my lord, Sansa said.Prince Joffrey looked annoyed that she would even ask . Have no fear, lady . I am almost a man grown, and I don ’ t fight with wood like your brothers . All I need is this . He drew his sword and showed it to her; a longsword adroitly shrunken to suit a boy of twelve, gleaming blue steel, castle-forged and double-edged, with a leather grip and a lion ’ s-head pommel in gold . Sansa exclaimed over it admiringly, and Joffrey looked pleased . I call it Lion ’ s Tooth, he said.No, no, no, Robert said . His breath steamed with every word . The camp is full of ears . Besides, I want to ride out and taste this country of yours . Ser Boros and Ser Meryn waited behind him with a dozen guardsmen, Ned saw . There was nothing to do but rub the sleep from his eyes, dress, and mount up.It was bitter cold outside . Bundled thickly in his furs, Tyrion Lannister pulled on his gloves and nodded to the poor frozen wretches standing sentry outside the Commander ’ s Keep . He set off across the yard for his own chambers in the King ’ s Tower, walking as briskly as his legs could manage . Patches of snow crunched beneath his feet as his boots broke the night ’ s crust, and his breath steamed before him like a banner . He shoved his hands into his armpits and walked faster, praying that Morrec had remembered to warm his bed with hot bricks from the fire.The Pact began four thousand years of friendship between men and children . In time, the First Men even put aside the gods they had brought with them, and took up the worship of the secret gods of the wood . The signing of the Pact ended the Dawn Age, and began the Age of Heroes.Dareon gave him a look . The stewards are fine for the likes of you and me, Sam, but not for Lord Snow.Not near soon enough, Cersei said . Then she frowned . Are we leaving? she echoed . What about you? Gods, don ’ t tell me you are staying here?It burned, yes . There is great healing magic in fire, even your hairless men know that.Jon shrugged . [BOS] No one cares where you sleep . Most of the old keeps are empty, you can pick any cell you want . [EOS] Once Castle Black had housed five thousand fighting men with all their horses and servants and weapons . Now it was home to a tenth that number, and parts of it were falling into ruin.What … what did he want of us?We have no choice, murmured Varys . Sadly, sadly …Grenn cradled his hand . The bastard broke my wrist.At that, the king stirred . Quiet, woman, he snapped . He straightened in his seat . I am sorry, Ned . I never meant to frighten the girl . It seemed best to bring her here and get the business done with quickly.Jon asked . [BOS] You see Prince Joffrey? [EOS] She looked at her son . And you, Robb?She rose gracefully and looked down at him from the lofty height of five feet or more . It is, m ’ lord, and she can speak for herself, if it please you.Both in mourning, and full of anger, he told her . Cat, I do not understand . What are you doing in King ’ s Landing? What ’ s happened? Ned asked his wife . Is it Bran? Is he … Dead was the word that came to his lips, but he could not say it.Robert set the pace, driving his huge black destrier hard as Ned galloped along beside him, trying to keep up . He called out a question as they rode, but the wind blew his words away, and the king did not hear him . After that Ned rode in silence . They soon left the kingsroad and took off across rolling plains dark with mist . By then the guard had fallen back a small distance, safely out of earshot, but still Robert would not slow.A eunuch has no honor, and a spider does not enjoy the luxury of scruples, my lord.Poole tells me it has been six days, Ned said . I must know how things stand.Maester Luwin took the paper from the dwarf ’ s hand, curious as a small grey squirrel . He unrolled it, studied it . I see . You draw nicely, my lord . Yes, this ought to work . I should have thought of this myself.Ned produced Robert ’ s letter . Lord Varys, be so kind as to show this to my lady of Lannister.A hundred, at the least, Joss answered, in the same instant as the bandaged smith said, Fifty, and the grandmother behind him, Hunnerds and hunnerds, m ’ lord, an army they was.Why does a bear shit in the woods? he demanded . Because it is his nature . Lying comes as easily as breathing to a man like Littlefinger . You ought to know that, you of all people.Will rose . Ser Waymar Royce stood over him.Standards had been raised atop all three towers . The Karstark sunburst hung from the Drunkard ’ s Tower, beneath the direwolf; on the Children ’ s Tower it was the Greatjon ’ s giant in shattered chains . But on the Gatehouse Tower, the Stark banner flew alone . That was where Robb had made his seat . Catelyn made for it, with Ser Brynden and Ser Wendel behind her, their horses stepping slowly down the log-and-plank road that had been laid across the green-and-black fields of mud.His friends rallied to him . We asked the septon to light a candle for your father, Matthar told him . It ’ s a lie, we all know it ’ s a lie, even Grenn knows it ’ s a lie, Pyp chimed in . Grenn nodded, and Sam clasped Jon ’ s hand, You ’ re my brother now, so he ’ s my father too, the fat boy said . If you want to go out to the weirwoods and pray to the old gods, I ’ ll go with you.No, Dany said . I will not have her harmed.Warm blood filled her mouth and ran down over her chin . The taste threatened to gag her, but she made herself chew and swallow . The heart of a stallion would make her son strong and swift and fearless, or so the Dothraki believed, but only if the mother could eat it all . If she choked on the blood or retched up the flesh, the omens were less favorable; the child might be stillborn, or come forth weak, deformed, or female.Tyrion hooted with laughter . My sweet sister might have a word or two to say about that!I might have a copper or two, but I ’ d sooner toss it down a well than pay for your howling, Ser Rodrik groused . His opinion of singers was well known; music was a lovely thing for girls, but he could not comprehend why any healthy boy would fill his hand with a harp when he might have had a sword.In that case, you had best stay close, the dwarf said . He cocked his oversized head to one side and looked Jon over with his mismatched eyes . I am Tyrion Lannister.Wise child . The knight smiled.Outside, one of the guards looked at him and said, Be strong, boy . The gods are cruel.He raced across the godswood, taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew . The heart tree had always frightened him; trees ought not have eyes, Bran thought, or leaves that looked like hands . His wolf came sprinting at his heels . You stay here, he told him at the base of the sentinel tree near the armory wall . Lie down . That ’ s right . Now stay.Jon lifted his sword … and lowered it, helpless . Damn you, he said . Damn you all.Uncle Benjen studied his face carefully . The Wall is a hard place for a boy, Jon.Their father understood as well . You want no pup for yourself, Jon? he asked softly.You did not trust me? Ned was frankly astonished.I am the sword in the darkness, Halder intoned.Joffrey shrugged . Come and see me when you ’ re older, Stark . If you ’ re not too old . There was laughter from the Lannister men.Tyrion Lannister had claimed that most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, but Jon was done with denials . He was who he was; Jon Snow, bastard and oathbreaker, motherless, friendless, and damned . For the rest of his life—however long that might be—he would be condemned to be an outsider, the silent man standing in the shadows who dares not speak his true name . Wherever he might go throughout the Seven Kingdoms, he would need to live a lie, lest every man ’ s hand be raised against him . But it made no matter, so long as he lived long enough to take his place by his brother ’ s side and help avenge his father.Is that what you did, little sister?It shall be as you command, my lord . Ser Barristan seemed old beyond his years . I have failed my sacred trust.The letters seemed to writhe and twist on the paper as his hand trailed to a stop . Lord Tywin and Ser Jaime were not men to suffer disgrace meekly; they would fight rather than flee . No doubt Lord Stannis was wary, after the murder of Jon Arryn, but it was imperative that he sail for King ’ s Landing at once with all his power, before the Lannisters could march.Distantly, as from far away, Dany heard her handmaid Jhiqui sobbing in fear, pleading that she dared not translate, that the khal would bind her and drag her behind his horse all the way up the Mother of Mountains . She put her arm around the girl . Don ’ t be afraid, she said . I shall tell him.He shoved her into a doorway, thrust dirty fingers through her hair, and gave it a twist, yanking her head back . —not a smart boy, that what you mean to say?You do not mean to die with him? You swear it, my queen?Catelyn took her husband ’ s hand . There was grievous news today, my lord . I did not wish to trouble you until you had cleansed yourself . There was no way to soften the blow, so she told him straight . I am so sorry, my love . Jon Arryn is dead.Then you ’ ll stay and say your words with me?Yes, Lysa said glumly, her voice as cold and dead as the captain of her guard.Jaime Lannister regarded his brother thoughtfully with those cool green eyes . Stark will never consent to leave Winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of death.The godswood was empty, as it always was here in this citadel of the southron gods . Ned ’ s leg was screaming as they lowered him to the grass beside the heart tree . Thank you . He drew a paper from his sleeve, sealed with the sigil of his House . Kindly deliver this at once.The madness of mercy, Ned admitted.He stood in the door for a moment, afraid to speak, afraid to come closer . The window was open . Below, a wolf howled . Ghost heard and lifted his head.We will make King ’ s Landing within the hour.Royce took it for acquiescence and turned away . Lead on, he said to Will.The Others take my wife, Robert muttered sourly, but he started back the way they had come, his footsteps falling heavily . And if I hear ‘ Your Grace ’ once more, I ’ ll have your head on a spike . We are more to each other than that.Littlefinger smiled . I promised Cat I would help you in your inquiries, and so I have.Littlefinger took his time saying his farewells . He kissed the black woman ’ s hand, whispered some joke that made her laugh aloud, and sauntered over to Ned . Your business, he said lightly, or Robert ’ s? They say the Hand dreams the king ’ s dreams, speaks with the king ’ s voice, and rules with the king ’ s sword . Does that also mean you fuck with the king ’ s—Why? Bran said, not understanding, falling, falling.A chill pierced Ned ’ s heart . My daughter …Jon said . [BOS] I have to go now, Uncle Benjen is waiting . I ’ m to go north to the Wall . We have to leave today, before the snows come . [EOS] He remembered how excited Bran had been at the prospect of the journey . It was more than he could bear, the thought of leaving him behind like this . Jon brushed away his tears, leaned over, and kissed his brother lightly on the lips.His father knelt and groped under the beast ’ s head with his hand . He gave a yank and held it up for all to see . A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with blood.Strike! Now, while the castle sleeps . Renly looked back at Ser Boros again and dropped his voice to an urgent whisper . We must get Joffrey away from his mother and take him in hand . Protector or no, the man who holds the king holds the kingdom . We should seize Myrcella and Tommen as well . Once we have her children, Cersei will not dare oppose us . The council will confirm you as Lord Protector and make Joffrey your ward.In my dreams, I kill him every night, Robert admitted . A thousand deaths will still be less than he deserves.Cradling the egg with both hands, she carried it to the fire and pushed it down amongst the burning coals . The black scales seemed to glow as they drank the heat . Flames licked against the stone with small red tongues . Dany placed the other two eggs beside the black one in the fire . As she stepped back from the brazier, the breath trembled in her throat.The walls of the throne room had been stripped bare, the hunting tapestries that King Robert loved taken down and stacked in the corner in an untidy heap.When he entered her, she welcomed him with whispered endearments and small, shuddering gasps of pleasure . Tyrion suspected her delight was feigned, but she did it so well that it did not matter . That much truth he did not crave.Robb galloped out to meet her, with Grey Wind racing beside his stallion . It ’ s done, she told him . Lord Walder will grant you your crossing . His swords are yours as well, less four hundred he means to keep back to hold the Twins . I suggest that you leave four hundred of your own, a mixed force of archers and swordsmen . He can scarcely object to an offer to augment his garrison … but make certain you give the command to a man you can trust . Lord Walder may need help keeping faith.Her father raised his voice still higher, straining to be heard . I betrayed the faith of my king and the trust of my friend, Robert, he shouted . I swore to defend and protect his children, yet before his blood was cold, I plotted to depose and murder his son and seize the throne for myself . Let the High Septon and Baelor the Beloved and the Seven bear witness to the truth of what I say: Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne, and by the grace of all the gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.Bran stared resentfully at the sweating boys below . If I still had my legs, I could beat them all . He remembered the last time he ’ d held a sword in his hand, when the king had come to Winterfell . It was only a wooden sword, yet he ’ d knocked Prince Tommen down half a hundred times . Ser Rodrik should teach me to use a poleaxe . If I had a poleaxe with a big long haft, Hodor could be my legs . We could be a knight together.Ser Willis Wode led them out . Bronn took the rear, with Lady Stark safely in the middle, Ser Rodrik a shadow beside her . Marillion kept throwing sullen looks back at Tyrion as they rode . The singer had broken several ribs, his woodharp, and all four fingers on his playing hand, yet the day had not been an utter loss to him; somewhere he had acquired a magnificent shadowskin cloak, thick black fur slashed by stripes of white . He huddled beneath its folds silently, and for once had nothing to say.He was, my lady.That would depend on the message . I will gladly provide you with paper and ink, if you like . And when you have written what you will, I will take the letter and read it, and deliver it or not, as best serves my own ends.The company included more swords than Catelyn would have liked . Three by the fire wore the red stallion badge of the Brackens, and there was a large party in blue steel ringmail and capes of a silvery grey . On their shoulder was another familiar sigil, the twin towers of House Frey . She studied their faces, but they were all too young to have known her . The senior among them would have been no older than Bran when she went north.The wolf did as he was told . Bran scratched him behind the ears, then turned away, jumped, grabbed a low branch, and pulled himself up . He was halfway up the tree, moving easily from limb to limb, when the wolf got to his feet and began to howl.They were seven, facing three . In the dream as it had been in life . Yet these were no ordinary three . They waited before the round tower, the red mountains of Dorne at their backs, their white cloaks blowing in the wind . And these were no shadows; their faces burned clear, even now . Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, had a sad smile on his lips . The hilt of the greatsword Dawn poked up over his right shoulder . Ser Oswell Whent was on one knee, sharpening his blade with a whetstone . Across his white-enameled helm, the black bat of his House spread its wings . Between them stood fierce old Ser Gerold Hightower, the White Bull, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.When the blades touched, the steel shattered.Dany touched the soft swell of her belly . Sweat beaded her skin and trickled down her brow . She could feel the old women watching her, the ancient crones of Vaes Dothrak, with eyes that shone dark as polished flint in their wrinkled faces . She must not flinch or look afraid . I am the blood of the dragon, she told herself as she took the stallion ’ s heart in both hands, lifted it to her mouth, and plunged her teeth into the tough, stringy flesh.He bowed . As you command.He showed her a ribbon . Catelyn felt her breath catch in her throat . The seal was a mockingbird, in grey wax . Petyr, she said . So soon . Something must have happened to Ser Rodrik . She looked at the head guardsman . Do you know who I am?When she turned away from the window, the man was in the room with her.The moment was gone . Sansa lowered her eyes . Thank you, she said when he was done . She was a good girl, and always remembered her courtesies.Cakes, are they? I could not say, Princess . The knight bowed . If you would pardon me for a time, I will seek out the captain and see if he has letters for us.And Lysa? A cool wind moved through his thin white hair . Gods be good, your sister … did she come as well?Do you remember Ser Jorah Mormont?Yet when she looked across the valley to the far ridge, she saw the Greatjon ’ s riders emerge from the darkness beneath the trees . They were in a long line, an endless line, and as they burst from the wood there was an instant, the smallest part of a heartbeat, when all Catelyn saw was the moonlight on the points of their lances, as if a thousand willowisps were coming down the ridge, wreathed in silver flame.Ser Willem Darry is fled to Dragonstone, with your queen and Prince Viserys . I thought you might have sailed with him.The sun was sinking below the trees when they reached their destination, a small clearing in the deep of the wood where nine weirwoods grew in a rough circle . Jon drew in a breath, and he saw Sam Tarly staring . Even in the wolfswood, you never found more than two or three of the white trees growing together; a grove of nine was unheard of . The forest floor was carpeted with fallen leaves, bloodred on top, black rot beneath . The wide smooth trunks were bone pale, and nine faces stared inward . The dried sap that crusted in the eyes was red and hard as ruby . Bowen Marsh commanded them to leave their horses outside the circle . This is a sacred place, we will not defile it.Other gifts she was given in plenty by other Dothraki: slippers and jewels and silver rings for her hair, medallion belts and painted vests and soft furs, sandsilks and jars of scent, needles and feathers and tiny bottles of purple glass, and a gown made from the skin of a thousand mice . A handsome gift, Khaleesi, Magister Illyrio said of the last, after he had told her what it was . Most lucky . The gifts mounted up around her in great piles, more gifts than she could possibly imagine, more gifts than she could want or use.Lord Tywin ’ s camp spread over leagues . Chella ’ s estimate of twenty thousand men could not be far wrong . The common men camped out in the open, but the knights had thrown up tents, and some of the high lords had erected pavilions as large as houses . Tyrion spied the red ox of the Presters, Lord Crakehall ’ s brindled boar, the burning tree of Marbrand, the badger of Lydden . Knights called out to him as he cantered past, and men-at-arms gaped at the clansmen in open astonishment.I would have told you that there was only one knife like this at King ’ s Landing . He grasped the blade between thumb and forefinger, drew it back over his shoulder, and threw it across the room with a practiced flick of his wrist . It struck the door and buried itself deep in the oak, quivering . It ’ s mine.Where ’ s your love of music, Bronn?Renly Baratheon laughed aloud . If we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence, it could be a long sit.Ser Jorah met her outside the shattered gate . He wore a dark green surcoat over his mail . His gauntlets, greaves, and greathelm were dark grey steel . The Dothraki had mocked him for a coward when he donned his armor, but the knight had spit insults right back in their teeth, tempers had flared, longsword had clashed with arakh, and the rider whose taunts had been loudest had been left behind to bleed to death.Samwell Tarly awaited them in the old stables, slumped on the ground against a bale of hay, too anxious to sleep . He rose and brushed himself off . I … I ’ m glad they found you, Jon.Tyrion felt the heat rise in him . It was not my dagger, he insisted . How many times must I swear to that? Lady Stark, whatever you may believe of me, I am not a stupid man . Only a fool would arm a common footpad with his own blade.Is that what you fear? Dany kissed him lightly on his broad forehead . I am not such a child as that, sweet ser.I shall send for him, Ned said . And the others.In his eyes, yes, she said.Even a man as blind as your brother should be able to follow our trail, he replied.All that way, Ned affirmed . The Lannister woman shall never have this skin.Ser Barristan looked up sharply . A hall to die in, and men to bury me . I thank you, my lords … but I spit upon your pity . He reached up and undid the clasps that held his cloak in place, and the heavy white garment slithered from his shoulders to fall in a heap on the floor . His helmet dropped with a clang . I am a knight, he told them . He opened the silver fastenings of his breastplate and let that fall as well . I shall die a knight.Behead the man, Ser Lyn Corbray suggested . When the Kingslayer receives the Imp ’ s head, it will be a warning to him.Ned ’ s neck was rigid with tension . For a moment he was so angry that he did not trust himself to speak.The gods help me if I do not get some sleep tonight . Yoren is determined to ride at first light . Tyrion got to his feet, sleepy from wine and tired of doom . I thank you for all the courtesies you have done me, Lord Mormont.Cersei Lannister considered Sansa thoughtfully . If Lord Eddard were to confess his crime, she said at last, we would know he had repented his folly.There ’ s some enemies a fire will keep away, Gared said . Bears and direwolves and … and other things …Jon drove him backward, attacking with every blow, keeping the older boy on the heels . Know your foe, Ser Rodrik had taught him once; Jon knew Halder, brutally strong but short of patience, with no taste for defense . Frustrate him, and he would leave himself open, as certain as sunset.Khal Drogo and his bloodriders led them through the great bazaar of the Western Market, down the broad ways beyond . Dany followed close on her silver, staring at the strangeness about her . Vaes Dothrak was at once the largest city and the smallest that she had ever known . She thought it must be ten times as large as Pentos, a vastness without walls or limits, its broad windswept streets paved in grass and mud and carpeted with wildflowers . In the Free Cities of the west, towers and manses and hovels and bridges and shops and halls all crowded in on one another, but Vaes Dothrak sprawled languorously, baking in the warm sun, ancient, arrogant, and empty.Sam blushed a vivid crimson and tripped over his own tongue as he tried to stammer out a courtesy . Jon had to smile.You ’ d do it in an instant, if it meant your life . You were quick enough to silence your friend Chiggen when he caught that arrow in his belly . Bronn had yanked back the man ’ s head by the hair and driven the point of his dirk in under the ear, and afterward told Catelyn Stark that the other sellsword had died of his wound.Fight! the boy screamed, his arms trembling as they clutched at his chair.When the fire died at last and the ground became cool enough to walk upon, Ser Jorah Mormont found her amidst the ashes, surrounded by blackened logs and bits of glowing ember and the burnt bones of man and woman and stallion . She was naked, covered with soot, her clothes turned to ash, her beautiful hair all crisped away … yet she was unhurt.I believe you would . Shae lowered the greathelm down over his head, and Pod fastened it to his gorget . Tyrion buckled on his belt, heavy with the weight of shortsword and dirk . By then his groom had brought up his mount, a formidable brown courser armored as heavily as he was . He needed help to mount; he felt as though he weighed a thousand stone . Pod handed him up his shield, a massive slab of heavy ironwood banded with steel . Lastly they gave him his battle-axe . Shae stepped back and looked him over . M ’ lord looks fearsome.A striding huntsman had been worked in scarlet thread upon the breast of the fat boy ’ s fur-trimmed surcoat . Jon did not recognize the sigil . Ser Alliser Thorne looked over his new charge and said, It would seem they have run short of poachers and thieves down south . Now they send us pigs to man the Wall . Is fur and velvet your notion of armor, my Lord of Ham?They would not have buried us, Robb said . Hack off their heads, we ’ ll send them back to the Wall . Leave the rest for the carrion crows.Finally Baelish drew rein in front of a ramshackle building, three stories, timbered, its windows bright with lamplight in the gathering dusk . The sounds of music and raucous laughter drifted out and floated over the water . Beside the door swung an ornate oil lamp on a heavy chain, with a globe of leaded red glass.Bran looked away and pretended not to have heard, but he could feel Greyjoy ’ s eyes on him . No doubt he was smiling . He smiled a lot, as if the world were a secret joke that only he was clever enough to understand . Robb seemed to admire Theon and enjoy his company, but Bran had never warmed to his father ’ s ward.A wooden stair ascended the south face, anchored on huge rough-hewn beams sunk deep into the ice and frozen in place . Back and forth it switched, clawing its way upward as crooked as a bolt of lightning . The black brothers assured him that it was much stronger than it looked, but Tyrion ’ s legs were cramping too badly for him to even contemplate the ascent . He went instead to the iron cage beside the well, clambered inside, and yanked hard on the bell rope, three quick pulls.The young knight with the green viper embroidered on his surcoat stepped forward and went to one knee . My lady, I beg the boon of championing your cause.Littlefinger shook the rain from his hair and laughed . Now I see . Lord Arryn learned that His Grace had filled the bellies of some whores and fishwives, and for that he had to be silenced . Small wonder . Allow a man like that to live, and next he ’ s like to blurt out that the sun rises in the east.Ned frowned, his face darkening . Open it.Absurd, isn ’ t it? Tyrion began to whistle the song again . I married her, he finally admitted.My uncle ’ s men, Jon thought numbly . He remembered how he ’ d pleaded to ride with them . Gods, I was such a green boy . If he had taken me, it might be me lying here …Pebbles rained down around them as Lharys came springing and sliding down the ridge . He landed breathless in front of Catelyn Stark, an ungainly-looking man with wild tufts of rust-colored hair sticking out from under a conical steel cap . Twenty men, maybe twenty-five, he said, breathless . Milk Snakes or Moon Brothers, by my guess . They must have eyes out, m ’ lady … hidden watchers … they know we ’ re here.She nodded, as calmly as if she had not heard his answer, and turned to the last of her champions . Ser Jorah Mormont, she said, first and greatest of my knights, I have no bride gift to give you, but I swear to you, one day you shall have from my hands a longsword like none the world has ever seen, dragon-forged and made of Valyrian steel . And I would ask for your oath as well.What do you wish to know?And the boy? Lord Tywin asked.Dany smiled shyly . It was sweet to laugh . She felt half a girl again.We will ride with you, lion lord, Chella daughter of Cheyk agreed, but only if your halfman son goes with us . He has bought his breath with promises . Until we hold the steel he has pledged us, his life is ours.And when the bleak dawn broke over an empty horizon, Dany knew that he was truly lost to her . When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, she said sadly . When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves . When my womb quickens again, and I bear a living child . Then you will return, my sun-and-stars, and not before.Why do you call me that? Dany challenged him . My brother Viserys was your king, was he not?This was something else: poison in the dark, a knife thrust to the soul . This he could never forgive, no more than he had forgiven Rhaegar . He will kill them all, Ned realized.That is the only time a man can be brave, his father told him . Do you understand why I did it?But Gunthor raised a hand . No . I would hear his words . The mothers go hungry, and steel fills more mouths than gold . What would you give us for your lives, Tyrion son of Tywin? Swords? Lances? Mail?Roose Bolton had re-formed the battered remnants of their other host at the mouth of the causeway . Ser Helman Tallhart and Walder Frey still held the Twins . Lord Tywin ’ s army had crossed the Trident, and was making for Harrenhal . And there were two kings in the realm . Two kings, and no agreement.A scream echoed through the forest night, and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces, the shards scattering like a rain of needles . Royce went to his knees, shrieking, and covered his eyes . Blood welled between his fingers.What are you so afraid of, Robb? she asked gently.Everyone was moving in the same direction, all in a hurry to see what the ringing was all about . The bells seemed louder now, clanging, calling . Arya joined the stream of people . Her thumb hurt so bad where the nail had broken that it was all she could do not to cry . She bit her lip as she limped along, listening to the excited voices around her.Jon followed the rest back to the armory, walking alone . He often walked alone here . There were almost twenty in the group he trained with, yet not one he could call a friend . Most were two or three years his senior, yet not one was half the fighter Robb had been at fourteen . Dareon was quick but afraid of being hit . Pyp used his sword like a dagger, Jeren was weak as a girl, Grenn slow and clumsy . Halder ’ s blows were brutally hard but he ran right into your attacks . The more time he spent with them, the more Jon despised them.Yoren was senior among the black brothers, so the steward had seated him between Robb and Maester Luwin . The old man had a sour smell, as if he had not washed in a long time . He ripped at the meat with his teeth, cracked the ribs to suck out the marrow from the bones, and shrugged at the mention of Jon Snow . Ser Alliser ’ s bane, he grunted, and two of his companions shared a laugh that Bran did not understand . But when Robb asked for news of their uncle Benjen, the black brothers grew ominously quiet.Oil, she commanded, and they brought forth the jars and poured them over the pyre, soaking the silks and the brush and the bundles of dry grass, until the oil trickled from beneath the logs and the air was rich with fragrance . Bring my eggs, Dany commanded her handmaids . Something in her voice made them run.The sixth man ran from the carnage … but not far . As he went scrambling up the far side of the bank, Grey Wind emerged from the stream, dripping wet . He shook the water off and bounded after the running man, hamstringing him with a single snap of his teeth, and going for the throat as the screaming man slid back down toward the water.Jon wished he understood what they were talking about, and why . What did he care about ravens and doves? If the old man had something to say to him, why couldn ’ t he just say it?Now, the knight said, I am less certain . They are better riders than any knight, utterly fearless, and their bows outrange ours . In the Seven Kingdoms, most archers fight on foot, from behind a shieldwall or a barricade of sharpened stakes . The Dothraki fire from horseback, charging or retreating, it makes no matter, they are full as deadly … and there are so many of them, my lady . Your lord husband alone counts forty thousand mounted warriors in his khalasar.Viserys had told her that the last Targaryen dragons had died no more than a century and a half ago, during the reign of Aegon III, who was called the Dragonbane . That did not seem so long ago to Dany . Everywhere? she said, disappointed . Even in the east? Magic had died in the west when the Doom fell on Valyria and the Lands of the Long Summer, and neither spell-forged steel nor stormsingers nor dragons could hold it back, but Dany had always heard that the east was different . It was said that manticores prowled the islands of the Jade Sea, that basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti, that spellsingers, warlocks, and aeromancers practiced their arts openly in Asshai, while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night . Why shouldn ’ t there be dragons too?You told him I had left orders not to be disturbed?He betrayed one already, or have you forgotten? the woman said . Oh, I don ’ t deny he ’ s loyal to Robert, that ’ s obvious . What happens when Robert dies and Joff takes the throne? And the sooner that comes to pass, the safer we ’ ll all be . My husband grows more restless every day . Having Stark beside him will only make him worse . He ’ s still in love with the sister, the insipid little dead sixteen-year-old . How long till he decides to put me aside for some new Lyanna?And you without an army . Littlefinger toyed with the dagger on the table, turning it slowly with a finger . There is small love lost between Lord Renly and the Lannisters . Bronze Yohn Royce, Ser Balon Swann, Ser Loras, Lady Tanda, the Redwyne twins … each of them has a retinue of knights and sworn swords here at court.A wooden platform had been built to elevate Robert ’ s chair; there the Lord of the Eyrie sat, giggling and clapping his hands as a humpbacked puppeteer in blue-and-white motley made two wooden knights hack and slash at each other . Pitchers of thick cream and baskets of blackberries had been set out, and the guests were sipping a sweet orange-scented wine from engraved silver cups . A fool ’ s festival, Brynden had called it, and small wonder.He settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank . The sweet, fruity taste of summerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips.That was the way they found them, when Robb and Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik burst in with half the guards in Winterfell . When the laughter finally died in her throat, they wrapped her in warm blankets and led her back to the Great Keep, to her own chambers . Old Nan undressed her and helped her into a scalding hot bath and washed the blood off her with a soft cloth.Ned crossed the room, took her by the arm, and pulled her to her feet . He held her there, his face inches from her . My lady, tell me! What was this message?This is well known, the king complained.From outside his cell came the rattle of iron chains . As the door creaked open, Ned put a hand to the damp wall and pushed himself toward the light . The glare of a torch made him squint . Food, he croaked.That grim thought soured Jon ’ s fragile mood . I need to see Hobb about the Old Bear ’ s supper, he announced brusquely, sliding Longclaw back into its scabbard . His friends meant well, but they did not understand . It was not their fault, truly; they had not had to face Othor, they had not seen the pale glow of those dead blue eyes, had not felt the cold of those dead black fingers . Nor did they know of the fighting in the riverlands . How could they hope to comprehend? He turned away from them abruptly and strode off, sullen . Pyp called after him, but Jon paid him no mind.The streets of Pentos were pitch-dark when they set out in Illyrio ’ s elaborately carved palanquin . Two servants went ahead to light their way, carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass, while a dozen strong men hoisted the poles to their shoulders . It was warm and close inside behind the curtains . Dany could smell the stench of Illyrio ’ s pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes.Hoster Tully had always been a big man; tall and broad in his youth, portly as he grew older . Now he seemed shrunken, the muscle and meat melted off his bones . Even his face sagged . The last time Catelyn had seen him, his hair and beard had been brown, well streaked with grey . Now they had gone white as snow.Viserys is dead . I am his heir, the last blood of House Targaryen . Whatever was his is mine now.Lord Walder was ninety, a wizened pink weasel with a bald spotted head, too gouty to stand unassisted . His newest wife, a pale frail girl of sixteen years, walked beside his litter when they carried him in . She was the eighth Lady Frey.He ’ s your father ’ s bannerman.They ’ re not fighting good, Mother, the Lord of the Eyrie complained . I want them to fight.Three days ride from Winterfell, however, the farmland gave way to dense wood, and the kingsroad grew lonely . The flint hills rose higher and wilder with each passing mile, until by the fifth day they had turned into mountains, cold blue-grey giants with jagged promontories and snow on their shoulders . When the wind blew from the north, long plumes of ice crystals flew from the high peaks like banners.Your blood is the last thing I desire.Behind the King ’ s Tower, the Wall glimmered in the light of the moon, immense and mysterious . Tyrion stopped for a moment to look up at it . His legs ached of cold and haste.I want one too, Rickon said . I want four . I ’ m four.What if you had missed the shot? Robb said . What if you ’ d only wounded him? What if you had made his hand jump, or hit Bran instead? For all you knew, the man might have been wearing a breastplate, all you could see was the back of his cloak . What would have happened to my brother then? Did you ever think of that, Greyjoy?What were you doing to that cat, boy? Myrcella asked again, sternly . To her brother she said, He ’ s a ragged boy, isn ’ t he? Look at him . She giggled.Ned eased himself slowly back onto the hard iron seat of Aegon ’ s misshapen throne . His eyes searched the faces along the wall . Lord Beric, he called out . Thoros of Myr . Ser Gladden . Lord Lothar . The men named stepped forward one by one . Each of you is to assemble twenty men, to bring my word to Gregor ’ s keep . Twenty of my own guards shall go with you . Lord Beric Dondarrion, you shall have the command, as befits your rank.The woman is important too! Arya protested.Have you drawn any watches this past week, Will?That would have been a very good time to have kept his mouth closed and his head bowed . He could see that now; seven hells, he had seen it then . The High Hall of the Arryns was long and austere, with a forbidding coldness to its walls of blue-veined white marble, but the faces around him had been colder by far . The power of Casterly Rock was far away, and there were no friends of the Lannisters in the Vale of Arryn . Submission and silence would have been his best defenses.Bronn sheathed his sword . Beyond a doubt.Then it turned out the purple flowers were called poison kisses, and Arya got a rash on her arms . Sansa would have thought that might have taught her a lesson, but Arya laughed about it, and the next day she rubbed mud all over her arms like some ignorant bog woman just because her friend Mycah told her it would stop the itching . She had bruises on her arms and shoulders too, dark purple welts and faded green-and-yellow splotches; Sansa had seen them when her sister undressed for sleep . How she had gotten those only the seven gods knew.I understand that you loved him, Ser Jorah said in a voice thick with despair . I loved my lady wife once, yet I did not die with her . You are my queen, my sword is yours, but do not ask me to stand aside as you climb on Drogo ’ s pyre . I will not watch you burn.That is, Ned finished quietly, watching, unless you have already promised the honor to another.The dwarf gave a bark of laughter . Would that I were a pumpkin, he said . Alas, my lord father would no doubt be most chagrined if his son of Lannister went to his fate like a load of turnips . If you ascend on foot, I fear I must do the same . We Lannisters do have a certain pride.Oh, yes, Viserys said darkly . He has tried, Illyrio, I promise you that . His hired knives follow us everywhere . I am the last dragon, and he will not sleep easy while I live.Sansa regarded her scrawny little sister in disbelief . You can ’ t look for rubies, the princess is expecting us . The queen invited us both.I should think a hundred knights, at the least, with all their retainers, and half again as many freeriders . Cersei and the children travel with them.Tyrion shrugged . We all need to be mocked from time to time, Lord Mormont, lest we start to take ourselves too seriously . More wine, please . He held out his cup.Ser Karyl Vance answered . I was attending my lord father in the pass below the Golden Tooth, as was Ser Marq . When the word of these outrages reached Ser Edmure Tully, he sent word that we should take a small force of men to find what survivors we could and bring them to the king.It be a mercy to kill them, Hullen said.Her handmaids filled the tub with tepid water that stank of sulfur, sweetening it with jars of bitter oil and handfuls of crushed mint leaves . While the bath was being prepared, Dany knelt awkwardly beside her lord husband, her belly great with their child within . She undid his braid with anxious fingers, as she had on the night he ’ d taken her for the first time, beneath the stars . His bells she laid aside carefully, one by one . He would want them again when he was well, she told herself.Rise, Dany commanded him . I would still like to taste that summerwine you spoke of.They were fed—hard cheese and fresh-baked bread and milk to break their fast, roast chicken and greens at midday, and a late supper of beef and barley stew—but the servants who brought the meals would not answer Sansa ’ s questions . That evening, some women brought her clothes from the Tower of the Hand, and some of Jeyne ’ s things as well, but they seemed nearly as frightened as Jeyne, and when she tried to talk to them, they fled from her as if she had the grey plague . The guards outside the door still refused to let them leave the room.Arya tapped her wooden sword against the side of her boot . I ’ ll trade you a fat pigeon, she said.Oh, yes, she purred, my giant of Lannister . She mounted him then, and for a time, she almost made him believe it . Tyrion went to sleep smiling …Her father snorted back laughter . That is the essence of it, I suppose.There was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the Great Keep where you had a view of the whole yard . That was where they headed.Dogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls . One of them, a black mongrel bitch with long yellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken . She stopped and edged under the bench to get a share . Jon watched the confrontation . The bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer . Ghost looked up, silent, and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes . The bitch snapped an angry challenge . She was three times the size of the direwolf pup . Ghost did not move . He stood over his prize and opened his mouth, baring his fangs . The bitch tensed, barked again, then thought better of this fight . She turned and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save her pride . Ghost went back to his meal.Truly, Lord Renly murmured . We brought the carcass back with us, at my brother ’ s command.A small army of slaves had gone ahead to prepare for Khal Drogo ’ s arrival . As each rider swung down from his saddle, he unbelted his arakh and handed it to a waiting slave, and any other weapons he carried as well . Even Khal Drogo himself was not exempt . Ser Jorah had explained that it was forbidden to carry a blade in Vaes Dothrak, or to shed a free man ’ s blood . Even warring khalasars put aside their feuds and shared meat and mead together when they were in sight of the Mother of Mountains . In this place, the crones of the dosh khaleen had decreed, all Dothraki were one blood, one khalasar, one herd.We do, but—Gared ’ s hood shadowed his face, but Will could see the hard glitter in his eyes as he stared at the knight . For a moment he was afraid the older man would go for his sword . It was a short, ugly thing, its grip discolored by sweat, its edge nicked from hard use, but Will would not have given an iron bob for the lordling ’ s life if Gared pulled it from its scabbard.Illyrio is no fool, Viserys said . He was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his pale lilac eyes . The magister knows that I will not forget my friends when I come into my throne.Tyrion took a deep breath . How did Littlefinger tell you I came by this dagger of his? Answer me that.When I was a boy, it was said that a long summer always meant a long winter to come . This summer has lasted nine years, Tyrion, and a tenth will soon be upon us . Think on that.Not easily, Catelyn warned them, and not in time . While you were mounting your siege, Tywin Lannister would bring up his host and assault you from the rear.Just what it appears, Littlefinger said, easing himself onto a window seat . A brothel . Can you think of a less likely place to find a Catelyn Tully? He smiled . As it chances, I own this particular establishment, so arrangements were easily made . I am most anxious to keep the Lannisters from learning that Cat is here in King ’ s Landing.Bronn rode with him . Behind them—after a quick bit of grumbling—the five clansmen followed on their under-size garrons, scrawny things that looked like ponies and scrambled up rock walls like goats.Khal Drogo grunted . The arrow must come out, Qotho.Even Robb looked shaken . The wolves … I don ’ t know why they did that …The man ’ s face might have been carved of stone, so little did it show . My lord Hand, he intoned . His Grace the King commands your presence . At once.And then he heard the laughter, sharp and cruel as a whip, and the voice of Ser Alliser Thorne . Not only a bastard, but a traitor ’ s bastard, he was telling the men around him.They are my people now, Dany said . You should not call them savages, brother.In the end, she wrote four letters . To her mother, the Lady Catelyn Stark, and to her brothers at Winterfell, and to her aunt and her grandfather as well, Lady Lysa Arryn of the Eyrie, and Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun . By the time she had done, her fingers were cramped and stiff and stained with ink . Varys had her father ’ s seal . She warmed the pale white beeswax over a candle, poured it carefully, and watched as the eunuch stamped each letter with the direwolf of House Stark.Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne, and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men, who had taken these lands from the children of the forest . Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept watch . So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost . He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog, and a dozen companions . For years he searched, until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities . One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it . And the Others smelled the hot blood in him, and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds—Her eyes snapped around and found him . A master of horse? Her voice was a whip.Somewhere the gold cloaks found a litter, but the trip back to the castle was a blur of agony, and Ned lost consciousness more than once . He remembered seeing the Red Keep looming ahead of him in the first grey light of dawn . The rain had darkened the pale pink stone of the massive walls to the color of blood.My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms, Dany said . She had known that for a long time, she realized . She had known it all her life . Only she had never let herself say the words, even in a whisper, but now she said them for Jorah Mormont and all the world to hear.Nor live, I hope, Mormont said, cutting his ham with a dagger and feeding a bite to the bird . You have not deserted—yet . Here you stand . If we beheaded every boy who rode to Mole ’ s Town in the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall . Yet maybe you mean to flee again on the morrow, or a fortnight from now . Is that it? Is that your hope, boy?Sansa slipped in among them, murmuring greetings as she worked her way toward the front . She recognized black-skinned Jalabhar Xho, gloomy Ser Aron Santagar, the Redwyne twins Horror and Slobber … only none of them seemed to recognize her . Or if they did, they shied away as if she had the grey plague . Sickly Lord Gyles covered his face at her approach and feigned a fit of coughing, and when funny drunken Ser Dontos started to hail her, Ser Balon Swann whispered in his ear and he turned away.Ned frowned . You sit in council and talk of ugly women and steel kisses, and now you expect me to believe that you tried to protect the girl? How big a fool do you take me for?Jon Snow winced . Halder had been born in a quarry and apprenticed as a stonemason . He was sixteen, tall and muscular, and his blows were as hard as any Jon had ever felt . [BOS] This will be uglier than a whore ’ s ass, [EOS] Pyp muttered, and it was.As the girl went to fetch their drinks, the Grand Maester knotted his fingers together and rested his hands on his stomach . The smallfolk say that the last year of summer is always the hottest . It is not so, yet ofttimes it feels that way, does it not? On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows . The heavy jeweled chain around the old man ’ s neck chinked softly as he shifted in his seat . To be sure, King Maekar ’ s summer was hotter than this one, and near as long . There were fools, even in the Citadel, who took that to mean that the Great Summer had come at last, the summer that never ends, but in the seventh year it broke suddenly, and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter . Still, the heat was fierce while it lasted . Oldtown steamed and sweltered by day and came alive only by night . We would walk in the gardens by the river and argue about the gods . I remember the smells of those nights, my lord—perfume and sweat, melons ripe to bursting, peaches and pomegranates, nightshade and moonbloom . I was a young man then, still forging my chain . The heat did not exhaust me as it does now . Pycelle ’ s eyes were so heavily lidded he looked half-asleep . My pardons, Lord Eddard . You did not come to hear foolish meanderings of a summer forgotten before your father was born . Forgive an old man his wanderings, if you would . Minds are like swords, I do fear . The old ones go to rust . Ah, and here is our milk . The serving girl placed the tray between them, and Pycelle gave her a smile . Sweet child . He lifted a cup, tasted, nodded . Thank you . You may go.Catelyn took his hand . Robb, I will not soften the truth for you . If you lose, there is no hope for any of us . They say there is naught but stone at the heart of Casterly Rock . Remember the fate of Rhaegar ’ s children.Septa Mordane quickly took a hand . Sweet child, this is Lord Petyr Baelish, of the king ’ s small council.The slave girl had not been far wrong, she thought . Khal Drogo was a head taller than the tallest man in the room, yet somehow light on his feet, as graceful as the panther in Illyrio ’ s menagerie . He was younger than she ’ d thought, no more than thirty . His skin was the color of polished copper, his thick mustachios bound with gold and bronze rings.Ser Raymun Darry took up the tale . At Wendish Town, the people sought shelter in their holdfast, but the walls were timbered . The raiders piled straw against the wood and burnt them all alive . When the Wendish folk opened their gates to flee the fire, they shot them down with arrows as they came running out, even women with suckling babes.His favorite haunt was the broken tower . Once it had been a watchtower, the tallest in Winterfell . A long time ago, a hundred years before even his father had been born, a lightning strike had set it afire . The top third of the structure had collapsed inward, and the tower had never been rebuilt . Sometimes his father sent ratters into the base of the tower, to clean out the nests they always found among the jumble of fallen stones and charred and rotten beams . But no one ever got up to the jagged top of the structure now except for Bran and the crows.Tyrion smiled crookedly . Take heart, Father . At least Rhaegar Targaryen is still dead.Ser Ilyn drew a two-handed greatsword from the scabbard on his back . As he lifted the blade above his head, sunlight seemed to ripple and dance down the dark metal, glinting off an edge sharper than any razor . Ice, she thought, he has Ice! Her tears streamed down her face, blinding her.Take him away and put him in irons, Catelyn said.Eons seemed to come and go . The sounds grew louder . She heard more laughter, a shouted command, splashing as they crossed and recrossed the little stream . A horse snorted . A man swore . And then at last she saw him … only for an instant, framed between the branches of the trees as she looked down at the valley floor, yet she knew it was him . Even at a distance, Ser Jaime Lannister was unmistakable . The moonlight had silvered his armor and the gold of his hair, and turned his crimson cloak to black . He was not wearing a helm.Sansa started as Joffrey laid his hand on her arm . It grows late, the prince said . He had a queer look on his face, as if he were not seeing her at all . Do you need an escort back to the castle?And would Joffrey allow it? He remembered the prince at Winterfell, the way he ’ d mocked Robb and Ser Rodrik in the yard . Jon himself he had scarcely even noticed; bastards were beneath even his contempt . My lord, will the king listen to you?You Lannisters had best remember that, Robb said, lowering his sword . Hodor, bring my brother here.Dany called out for the men of her khas and bid them take Mirri Maz Duur and bind her hand and foot, but the maegi smiled at her as they carried her off, as if they shared a secret . A word, and Dany could have her head off … yet then what would she have? A head? If life was worthless, what was death?Robert ’ s mouth gave a bitter twist . Not well, in truth, he admitted . I think losing Jon has driven the woman mad, Ned . She has taken the boy back to the Eyrie . Against my wishes . I had hoped to foster him with Tywin Lannister at Casterly Rock . Jon had no brothers, no other sons . Was I supposed to leave him to be raised by women?All that way? Jory said, astonished.It ’ s dark here . And cold.Are you certain that you must leave us so soon? the Lord Commander asked him.Wine? Dany said doubtfully . Viserys could not abide the taste of the fermented mare ’ s milk the Dothraki drank, she knew that, and he was oft at the bazaars these days, drinking with the traders who came in the great caravans from east and west . He seemed to find their company more congenial than hers.Sansa ’ s ear felt numb . She touched it, and her fingertips came away wet and red . I … as … as you command, my lord.My lady, you ought cover your head, Ser Rodrik told her as their horses plodded north . You will take a chill.Arya was chewing at her lip in that disgusting way she had . Can we take Syrio back with us?Are you really a crow? Bran asked.It is not a matter of gold or horses . This is bloodmagic, lady . Only death may pay for life.The Old Bear gave a stubborn shake of his head . Not yet . I want Maester Aemon to have a look at them . We ’ ll bring them back to the Wall.Maester Luwin stood . We might do well to question her.Later, Maester Luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in Bran ’ s clothes and flung him off the wall into the yard below, to demonstrate what would happen to Bran if he fell . That had been fun, but afterward Bran just looked at the maester and said, I ’ m not made of clay . And anyhow, I never fall.My daughters …Afterward, Dany sent them all away, so she might prepare Khal Drogo for his final ride into the night lands . She washed his body clean and brushed and oiled his hair, running her fingers through it for the last time, feeling the weight of it, remembering the first time she had touched it, the night of their wedding ride . His hair had never been cut . How many men could die with their hair uncut? She buried her face in it and inhaled the dark fragrance of the oils . He smelled like grass and warm earth, like smoke and semen and horses . He smelled like Drogo . Forgive me, sun of my life, she thought . Forgive me for all I have done and all I must do . I paid the price, my star, but it was too high, too high …Ned greeted him coldly . Might I ask the reason for this visit, Lord Baelish?And now you must save him, Dany said . Please …A swollen red sun hung low against the western hills when the gates of the castle opened . The drawbridge creaked down, the portcullis winched up, and Lady Catelyn Stark rode forth to rejoin her son and his lords bannermen . Behind her came Ser Jared Frey, Ser Hosteen Frey, Ser Danwell Frey, and Lord Walder ’ s bastard son Ronel Rivers, leading a long column of pikemen, rank on rank of shuffling men in blue steel ringmail and silvery grey cloaks.Mormont stood before the altar, the rainbow shining on his broad bald head . You came to us outlaws, he began, poachers, rapers, debtors, killers, and thieves . You came to us children . You came to us alone, in chains, with neither friends nor honor . You came to us rich, and you came to us poor . Some of you bear the names of proud houses . Others have only bastards ’ names, or no names at all . It makes no matter . All that is past now . On the Wall, we are all one house.The new-made lord, Janos Slynt, spoke up, his voice heavy and blunt . Her Grace is trying to tell you that you are relieved as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.Call it what you will, my lord . Knights have been arriving from all over the realm, and for every knight we get two freeriders, three craftsmen, six men-at-arms, a dozen merchants, two dozen whores, and more thieves than I dare guess . This cursed heat had half the city in a fever to start, and now with all these visitors … last night we had a drowning, a tavern riot, three knife fights, a rape, two fires, robberies beyond count, and a drunken horse race down the Street of the Sisters . The night before a woman ’ s head was found in the Great Sept, floating in the rainbow pool . No one seems to know how it got there or who it belongs to.The queen wore a high-collared black silk gown, with a hundred dark red rubies sewn into her bodice, covering her from neck to bosom . They were cut in the shape of teardrops, as if the queen were weeping blood . Cersei smiled to see her, and Sansa thought it was the sweetest and saddest smile she had ever seen . Sansa, my sweet child, she said, I know you ’ ve been asking for me . I ’ m sorry that I could not send for you sooner . Matters have been very unsettled, and I have not had a moment . I trust my people have been taking good care of you?Catelyn looked at the knife, then at Bran . No, she said . The word stuck in her throat, the merest whisper.The bald man took hold of his hair with his free hand and twisted it cruelly, till Bran sobbed in pain . You shut your mouth, cripple, you hear me? He twisted harder . You hear me?And the other?Your grandfather has a sour nature, Marillion said to Catelyn . I meant to do you honor . An homage to your beauty . In truth, I was made to sing for kings and high lords.Why? Ned asked . He saw her hands then, the awkward way she held them, the raw red scars, the stiffness of the last two fingers on her left . You ’ ve been hurt . He took her hands in his own, turned them over . Gods . Those are deep cuts … a gash from a sword or … how did this happen, my lady?I feared you ’ d never come, my lord, she whispered against his chest . Petyr has been bringing me reports . He told me of your troubles with Arya and the young prince . How are my girls?Toad stepped close . The little lordling has a mouth on him, he said . He had pig eyes, small and shiny . Is that your mommy ’ s mouth, bastard? What was she, some whore? Tell us her name . Maybe I had her a time or two . He laughed.Jon could taste the mockery there, but there was no denying the truth . The Watch had built nineteen great strongholds along the Wall, but only three were still occupied: Eastwatch on its grey windswept shore, the Shadow Tower hard by the mountains where the Wall ended, and Castle Black between them, at the end of the kingsroad . The other keeps, long deserted, were lonely, haunted places, where cold winds whistled through black windows and the spirits of the dead manned the parapets.His eyes opened to the sound of Edmure ’ s voice . Little cat, he murmured in a voice thin and wispy and wracked by pain . My little cat . A tremulous smile touched his face as his hand groped for hers . I watched for you …Lord Blackwood agreed, to Catelyn ’ s surprise and dismay . And if we do make peace with King Joffrey, are we not then traitors to King Renly? What if the stag should prevail against the lion, where would that leave us?Would that I could, Ned said grimly . If she was so determined to force the issue here and now, she left him no choice . Your son has no claim to the throne he sits . Lord Stannis is Robert ’ s true heir.Sansa couldn ’ t help but smile a little . The kennelmaster once told her that an animal takes after its master . She gave Lady a quick little hug . Lady licked her cheek . Sansa giggled . Arya heard and whirled around, glaring . I don ’ t care what you say, I ’ m going out riding . Her long horsey face got the stubborn look that meant she was going to do something willful.Her hands found a heavy iron ring set in the wood, and she yanked at it . The door resisted a moment, before it slowly began to swing inward, with a creak so loud Arya was certain it could be heard all through the city . She opened the door just far enough to slip through, into the hallway beyond.This time, Ned resolved to keep his temper . Your Grace, the girl is scarcely more than a child . You are no Tywin Lannister, to slaughter innocents . It was said that Rhaegar ’ s little girl had cried as they dragged her from beneath her bed to face the swords . The boy had been no more than a babe in arms, yet Lord Tywin ’ s soldiers had torn him from his mother ’ s breast and dashed his head against a wall.Catelyn kissed him gently, smoothed his hair, and left him there in the shade of his keep, with his rivers flowing beneath . He was asleep before she left the solar.Ned saw the man . Another of the eunuch ’ s whisperers?All alone, are you? said the biggest of them, a bald man with a raw windburnt face . Lost in the wolfswood, poor lad.He walked to the Lord Commander ’ s Tower alone, with a curious sense of apprehension . The brothers on guard eyed him solemnly as he approached . The Old Bear ’ s in his solar, one of them announced . He was asking for you.Shae murmured sleepily and rolled toward him when he sat on the edge of the featherbed . He slid his hand under the blanket and cupped a soft breast, and her eyes opened . M ’ lord, she said with a drowsy smile.In the place of the traitor Stannis Baratheon, it is the wish of His Grace that his lady mother, the Queen Regent Cersei Lannister, who has ever been his staunchest support, be seated upon his small council, that she may help him rule wisely and with justice . So the king has decreed . The small council consents.Maester Luwin pulled at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck . All we have is conjecture . This is the queen ’ s beloved brother we mean to accuse . She will not take it kindly . We must have proof, or forever keep silent.The only thing was, the pot-shops were never empty, and even as she bolted down her food, Arya could feel them watching . Some of them stared at her boots or her cloak, and she knew what they were thinking . With others, she could almost feel their eyes crawling under her leathers; she didn ’ t know what they were thinking, and that scared her even more . A couple times, she was followed out into the alleys and chased, but so far no one had been able to catch her.They await our coming, my lady, Ser Wylis Manderly said, as my lord father swore they would.His lord father took his place on the hill where he had slept . Around him, the reserve assembled; a huge force, half mounted and half foot, five thousand strong . Lord Tywin almost always chose to command the reserve; he would take the high ground and watch the battle unfold below him, committing his forces when and where they were needed most.A direwolf, Jon said . His name is Ghost . He stared up at the little man, his disappointment suddenly forgotten . What are you doing up there? Why aren ’ t you at the feast?A khal who cannot ride is no khal, said Jhogo.Oh, I love riding, Sansa said.The door to the yard flew open . Sunlight came streaming across the hall as Rickon burst in, breathless . The direwolves were with him . The boy stopped by the door, wide-eyed, but the wolves came on . Their eyes found Lannister, or perhaps they caught his scent . Summer began to growl first . Grey Wind picked it up . They padded toward the little man, one from the right and one from the left.Ahead, Ser Jorah answered . Under the mountain.Ned frowned . The man Syrio Forel had come with an excellent reputation, and his flamboyant Braavosi style was well suited to Arya ’ s slender blade, yet still … a few days ago, she had been wandering around with a swatch of black silk tied over her eyes . Syrio was teaching her to see with her ears and her nose and her skin, she told him . Before that, he had her doing spins and back flips . Arya, are you certain you want to persist in this?Farms and holdfasts grew scarcer and smaller as they pressed northward, ever deeper into the darkness of the wolfswood, until finally there were no more roofs to shelter under, and they were thrown back on their own resources.Tell me what you know of the fighting in the riverlands, she said . She had to learn if he was truly ready.A herald ’ s voice rang out . All hail His Grace, Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the First of his Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms . All hail his lady mother, Cersei of House Lannister, Queen Regent, Light of the West, and Protector of the Realm.No sword is strong until it ’ s been tempered, Lord Tywin declared . The Stark boy is a child . No doubt he likes the sound of warhorns well enough, and the sight of his banners fluttering in the wind, but in the end it comes down to butcher ’ s work . I doubt he has the stomach for it.I wanted to, truly . I just … I couldn ’ t . I didn ’ t want him to hit me anymore . He looked at the ground . I … I fear I ’ m a coward . My lord father always said so.So he listened, and she told it all, from the fire in the library tower to Varys and the guardsmen and Littlefinger . And when she was done, Eddard Stark sat dazed beside the table, the dagger in his hand . Bran ’ s wolf had saved the boy ’ s life, he thought dully . What was it that Jon had said when they found the pups in the snow? Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord . And he had killed Sansa ’ s, and for what? Was it guilt he was feeling? Or fear? If the gods had sent these wolves, what folly had he done?Across the road, the girl was still crying, her high singsong tongue strange to Dany ’ s ears . The first man was done with her now, and a second had taken his place.Jon had nothing to say to that . He threw meat, wondering why he ’ d been summoned . No doubt the old man would tell him, in his own good time . Maester Aemon was not a man to be hurried.Later, my sweet baby, Lysa promised him.Pyp grinned . We ’ re not all as dumb as Grenn.Varys bobbed his head . I was grievous sad to hear about your son . And him so young . The gods are cruel.Tyrion shrugged . Benjen Stark is returning to the Night ’ s Watch with his brother ’ s bastard . I have a mind to go with them and see this Wall we have all heard so much of.Catelyn wished she could share his joy . But she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the snow, a broken antler in its throat . Dread coiled within her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved, this man who put no faith in signs . I knew that would please you, she said . We should send word to your brother on the Wall.It was the last thing Tyrion Lannister would ever have anticipated . He reached for his wine, and considered for a moment as he sipped . And what am I to do there?The silver bracelet she ’ d hoped to sell had been stolen her first night out of the castle, along with her bundle of good clothes, snatched while she slept in a burnt-out house off Pig Alley . All they left her was the cloak she had been huddled in, the leathers on her back, her wooden practice sword … and Needle . She ’ d been lying on top of Needle, or else it would have been gone too; it was worth more than all the rest together . Since then Arya had taken to walking around with her cloak draped over her right arm, to conceal the blade at her hip . The wooden sword she carried in her left hand, out where everybody could see it, to scare off robbers, but there were men in the pot-shops who wouldn ’ t have been scared off if she ’ d had a battle-axe . It was enough to make her lose her taste for pigeon and stale bread . Often as not, she went to bed hungry rather than risk the stares.You might have come to me earlier.The wolf was looking at her . Its jaws were red and wet and its eyes glowed golden in the dark room . It was Bran ’ s wolf, she realized . Of course it was . Thank you, Catelyn whispered, her voice faint and tiny . She lifted her hand, trembling . The wolf padded closer, sniffed at her fingers, then licked at the blood with a wet rough tongue . When it had cleaned all the blood off her hand, it turned away silently and jumped up on Bran ’ s bed and lay down beside him . Catelyn began to laugh hysterically.Donal Noye leaned forward, into Jon ’ s face . Now think on this, boy . None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser . Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley . What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad . They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword . His look was grim . So how do you like the taste of your victories now, Lord Snow?Hodor, Bran agreed, wondering what it meant.Syrio stepped back . You are dead now.A man in your place should count himself fortunate that his head is still on his shoulders, the queen declared.Damn you, Robert, Ned said when they were alone . His leg was throbbing so badly he was almost blind with pain . Or perhaps it was grief that fogged his eyes . He lowered himself to the bed, beside his friend . Why do you always have to be so headstrong?That is a matter for the king to decide, Grand Maester Pycelle announced ponderously.Yours? It made no sense . Petyr had not been at Winterfell.You did? the boy said suspiciously . Perhaps he thought Tyrion was making fun of him.Her uncle ’ s voice was troubled . Lord Robert, he sighed . Six years old, sickly, and prone to weep if you take his dolls away . Jon Arryn ’ s trueborn heir, by all the gods, yet there are some who say he is too weak to sit his father ’ s seat . Nestor Royce has been high steward these past fourteen years, while Lord Jon served in King ’ s Landing, and many whisper that he should rule until the boy comes of age . Others believe that Lysa must marry again, and soon . Already the suitors gather like crows on a battlefield . The Eyrie is full of them.All that Syrio Forel had taught her went racing through her head . Swift as a deer . Quiet as a shadow . Fear cuts deeper than swords . Quick as a snake . Calm as still water . Fear cuts deeper than swords . Strong as a bear . Fierce as a wolverine . Fear cuts deeper than swords . The man who fears losing has already lost . Fear cuts deeper than swords . Fear cuts deeper than swords . Fear cuts deeper than swords . The grip of her wooden sword was slick with sweat, and Arya was breathing hard when she reached the turret stair . For an instant she froze . Up or down? Up would take her to the covered bridge that spanned the small court to the Tower of the Hand, but that would be the way they ’ d expect her to go, for certain . Never do what they expect, Syrio once said . Arya went down, around and around, leaping over the narrow stone steps two and three at a time . She emerged in a cavernous vaulted cellar, surrounded by casks of ale stacked twenty feet tall . The only light came through narrow slanting windows high in the wall.He wondered what was happening beyond the walls (such as they were) of his cell . Lord Tywin would surely have sent out riders when the word reached him . Jaime might be leading a host through the Mountains of the Moon even now … unless he was riding north against Winterfell instead . Did anyone outside the Vale even suspect where Catelyn Stark had taken him? He wondered what Cersei would do when she heard . The king could order him freed, but would Robert listen to his queen or his Hand? Tyrion had no illusions about the king ’ s love for his sister.When her eyes were closed and her breathing deep and steady, Tyrion slid out from beneath her, gently, so as not to disturb her sleep . Naked, he crawled outside, stepped over his squire, and walked around behind his tent to make water.Maege Mormont stood . The King of Winter! she declared, and laid her spiked mace beside the swords . And the river lords were rising too, Blackwood and Bracken and Mallister, houses who had never been ruled from Winterfell, yet Catelyn watched them rise and draw their blades, bending their knees and shouting the old words that had not been heard in the realm for more than three hundred years, since Aegon the Dragon had come to make the Seven Kingdoms one … yet now were heard again, ringing from the timbers of her father ’ s hall:You mean they ’ re lying?Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, was in his middle fifties, yet hard as a man of twenty . Even seated, he was tall, with long legs, broad shoulders, a flat stomach . His thin arms were corded with muscle . When his once-thick golden hair had begun to recede, he had commanded his barber to shave his head; Lord Tywin did not believe in half measures . He razored his lip and chin as well, but kept his sidewhiskers, two great thickets of wiry golden hair that covered most of his cheeks from ear to jaw . His eyes were a pale green, flecked with gold . A fool more foolish than most had once jested that even Lord Tywin ’ s shit was flecked with gold . Some said the man was still alive, deep in the bowels of Casterly Rock.My lord . The voice made Jon glance back in surprise . Samwell Tarly was on his feet . The fat boy wiped his sweaty palms against his tunic . Might I … might I go as well? To say my words at this heart tree?Was there nothing else? No final words?Jon turned on him in a fury . [BOS] I see Ser Alliser ’ s bloody hand, that ’ s all I see . He wanted to shame me, and he has . [EOS] It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord, Catelyn said.You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark, said Cersei Lannister . Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.The eunuch spread his soft hands . On more than that, I hope, sweet lady . I have great esteem for your husband, our new Hand, and I know we do both love King Robert.Another day, Ned said . Perhaps too sharply, from the looks they gave him . He would have to remember that he was no longer in Winterfell, where only the king stood higher; here, he was but first among equals . Forgive me, my lords, he said in a softer tone . I am tired . Let us call a halt for today and resume when we are fresher . He did not ask for their consent, but stood abruptly, nodded at them all, and made for the door.My brother? Her sob was half a laugh . He does not know yet, does he? The Usurper owes Drogo a lordship . This time her laugh was half a sob . She hugged herself protectively . And me, you said . Only me?Tyrion sighed . You are remarkably polite for a bastard, Snow . What you see is a dwarf . You are what, twelve?Sometimes I dream about it, he said . I ’ m walking down this long empty hall . My voice echoes all around, but no one answers, so I walk faster, opening doors, shouting names . I don ’ t even know who I ’ m looking for . Most nights it ’ s my father, but sometimes it ’ s Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my uncle . The thought of Benjen Stark saddened him; his uncle was still missing . The Old Bear had sent out rangers in search of him . Ser Jaremy Rykker had led two sweeps, and Quorin Halfhand had gone forth from the Shadow Tower, but they ’ d found nothing aside from a few blazes in the trees that his uncle had left to mark his way . In the stony highlands to the northwest, the marks stopped abruptly and all trace of Ben Stark vanished.Every eye in the hall was fixed on him, waiting . Slowly Ned struggled to his feet, pushing himself up from the throne with the strength of his arms, his shattered leg screaming inside its cast . He did his best to ignore the pain; it was no moment to let them see his weakness . The First Men believed that the judge who called for death should wield the sword, and in the north we hold to that still . I mislike sending another to do my killing … yet it seems I have no choice . He gestured at his broken leg.You make us look bad, complained Toad.He is my wife ’ s twin, a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, his life and fortune and honor all bound to mine.Littlefinger came calling an hour after the Grand Maester had left, clad in a plum-colored doublet with a mockingbird embroidered on the breast in black thread, and a striped cloak of black and white . I cannot visit long, my lord, he announced . Lady Tanda expects me to lunch with her . No doubt she will roast me a fatted calf . If it ’ s near as fatted as her daughter, I ’ m like to rupture and die . And how is your leg?The knight smiled . Ser Jorah was not a handsome man . He had a neck and shoulders like a bull, and coarse black hair covered his arms and chest so thickly that there was none left for his head . Yet his smiles gave Dany comfort . You are learning to talk like a queen, Daenerys.A hard sacrifice, Maester Luwin agreed . Yet these are hard times, my lord . His road is no crueler than yours or your lady ’ s.Is that wise, Lord Eddard? With your leg and all?Your boy, he whispered . He had my eyes, I remember …Then there was a stirring in the rear of the chamber . I ’ ll stand for the dwarf, Bronn called out.Tell me.I said, I will not have it! To hell with her reasons . You will command her to release the dwarf at once, and you will make your peace with Jaime.Six, and sickly, and Lord of the Eyrie, gods have mercy, the king swore . Lord Tywin had never taken a ward before . Lysa ought to have been honored . The Lannisters are a great and noble House . She refused to even hear of it . Then she left in the dead of night, without so much as a by-your-leave . Cersei was furious . He sighed deeply . The boy is my namesake, did you know that? Robert Arryn . I am sworn to protect him . How can I do that if his mother steals him away?The weariness came on him suddenly, as he donned the roughspun blacks that were their everyday wear . He sat on a bench, his fingers fumbling with the fastenings on his cloak . So cold, he thought, remembering the warm halls of Winterfell, where the hot waters ran through the walls like blood through a man ’ s body . There was scant warmth to be found in Castle Black; the walls were cold here, and the people colder.Fallen, Will insisted . There ’ s one woman up an ironwood, half-hid in the branches . A far-eyes . He smiled thinly . I took care she never saw me . When I got closer, I saw that she wasn ’ t moving neither . Despite himself, he shivered.And then there was movement beside the bed, and something landed lightly on his legs . He felt nothing . A pair of yellow eyes looked into his own, shining like the sun . The window was open and it was cold in the room, but the warmth that came off the wolf enfolded him like a hot bath . His pup, Bran realized … or was it? He was so big now . He reached out to pet him, his hand trembling like a leaf.Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord . What of it? Shall we send her a wedding gift?The short man gave a sodden shrug . He was the King ’ s Hand . Doubtless Robert asked him to see that they were provided for.They are not Starks, he said.Let him speak, Lady Stark commanded.It was all Tyrion could do not to laugh . Quiet? The old fool . Unless he took the whole inn, the word would begin to spread the instant they were gone . The freerider with the gold coin in his pocket would fly to Casterly Rock like an arrow . If not him, then someone else . Yoren would carry the story south . That fool singer might make a lay of it . The Freys would report back to their lord, and the gods only knew what he might do . Lord Walder Frey might be sworn to Riverrun, but he was a cautious man who had lived a long time by making certain he was always on the winning side . At the very least he would send his birds winging south to King ’ s Landing, and he might well dare more than that.He reports to Varys . The Spider has taken a great interest in you and all your doings . He shifted in the window seat . Now glance at the wall . Farther west, above the stables . The guardsman leaning on the ramparts?Tell Captain Qos to hoist my banner as soon as he comes in sight of the island . They may be wary of unexpected visitors . If he is reluctant, offer him whatever it takes . I will give you a letter to place into the hand of Lord Stannis Baratheon . No one else . Not his steward, nor the captain of his guard, nor his lady wife, but only Lord Stannis himself.Yes, my lord . The soft leather gave beneath Jon ’ s fingers, as if the sword were molding itself to his grip already . He knew he should be honored, and he was, and yet …Sometimes the gods are merciful.Jon said at once . [BOS] No, That couldn ’ t be . My father would never betray the king! [EOS] Benjen Stark is still First Ranger, Jon Snow told him, toying with his bowl of blueberries . The rest might have given up all hope of his uncle ’ s safe return, but not him . He pushed away the berries, scarcely touched, and rose from the bench.He was finishing the last of the pork pie the cooks had served up for supper when Jon sat down across from him . The fat boy ’ s eyes widened at the sight of Ghost . Is that a wolf?Far across the city, bells began to ring.Ned pushed himself up higher, wincing as his leg trembled with pain . He had not expected Cersei to come . It did not bode well that she had . Send them in, and leave us . What we have to say should not go beyond these walls . Poole withdrew quietly.They found her on the carpet, crawling toward her dragon eggs . Ser Jorah Mormont lifted her in his arms and carried her back to her sleeping silks, while she struggled feebly against him . Over his shoulder she saw her three handmaids, Jhogo with his little wisp of mustache, and the flat broad face of Mirri Maz Duur . I must, she tried to tell them, I have to …Finally Jon said, We should go back to the common hall.Unlike his brother, Ser Gregor did not live at court . He was a solitary man who seldom left his own lands, but for wars and tourneys . He had been with Lord Tywin when King ’ s Landing fell, a new-made knight of seventeen years, even then distinguished by his size and his implacable ferocity . Some said it had been Gregor who ’ d dashed the skull of the infant prince Aegon Targaryen against a wall, and whispered that afterward he had raped the mother, the Dornish princess Elia, before putting her to the sword . These things were not said in Gregor ’ s hearing.A knight of the Kingsguard stood beneath the arch of the door with five Lannister guardsmen arrayed behind him . He was in full armor, but his visor was up . Arya remembered his droopy eyes and rust-colored whiskers from when he had come to Winterfell with the king: Ser Meryn Trant . The red cloaks wore mail shirts over boiled leather and steel caps with lion crests . Arya Stark, the knight said, come with us, child.The water was scalding hot, as she liked it . I will give my brother his gifts tonight, she decided as Jhiqui was washing her hair . He should look a king in the sacred city . Doreah, run and find him and invite him to sup with me . Viserys was nicer to the Lysene girl than to her Dothraki handmaids, perhaps because Magister Illyrio had let him bed her back in Pentos . Irri, go to the bazaar and buy fruit and meat . Anything but horseflesh.Will could see the tightness around Gared ’ s mouth, the barely suppressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak . Gared had spent forty years in the Night ’ s Watch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being made light of . Yet it was more than that . Under the wounded pride, Will could sense something else in the older man . You could taste it; a nervous tension that came perilous close to fear.Be that as it may, said Mormont . It is not for me to say . Nor for you.Then give your words to Bran too.It would be my pleasure, Mother, Joffrey said very formally . He took her by the arm and led her away from the wheelhouse, and Sansa ’ s spirits took flight . A whole day with her prince! She gazed at Joffrey worshipfully . He was so gallant, she thought . The way he had rescued her from Ser Ilyn and the Hound, why, it was almost like the songs, like the time Serwyn of the Mirror Shield saved the Princess Daeryssa from the giants, or Prince Aemon the Dragonknight championing Queen Naerys ’ s honor against evil Ser Morgil ’ s slanders.Then Grand Maester Pycelle was looming over him, holding a cup, whispering, Drink, my lord . Here . The milk of the poppy, for your pain . He remembered swallowing, and Pycelle was telling someone to heat the wine to boiling and fetch him clean silk, and that was the last he knew.Ser Waymar Royce did not deign to reply.A hope, call it, Tyrion said . Another toss of the dice.Cayn returned as he was pressing the direwolf seal down into the soft white wax . Desmond was with him, and between them Littlefinger . Ned thanked his guards and sent them away.This time the knight grasped her beneath the jaw and held her head still as he struck her . He hit her twice, left to right, and harder, right to left . Her lip split and blood ran down her chin, to mingle with the salt of her tears.Joffrey scowled . You must never mock me like that . A true wife does not mock her lord . Ser Meryn, teach her.Her eyes burned, green fire in the dusk, like the lioness that was her sigil . The night of our wedding feast, the first time we shared a bed, he called me by your sister ’ s name . He was on top of me, in me, stinking of wine, and he whispered Lyanna.He looked south, and saw the great blue-green rush of the Trident . He saw his father pleading with the king, his face etched with grief . He saw Sansa crying herself to sleep at night, and he saw Arya watching in silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart . There were shadows all around them . One shadow was dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound . Another was armored like the sun, golden and beautiful . Over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood.That was when Sansa finally seemed to comprehend . Her eyes were frightened as they went to her father . He doesn ’ t mean Lady, does he? She saw the truth on his face . No, she said . No, not Lady, Lady didn ’ t bite anybody, she ’ s good …Ned ’ s eyes flicked to the king ’ s letter on the table beside him, its seal unbroken . And how is it you know that, my lord?At sunset on the second day, a great bell began to ring . Its voice was deep and sonorous, and the long slow clanging filled Sansa with a sense of dread . The ringing went on and on, and after a while they heard other bells answering from the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya ’ s Hill . The sound rumbled across the city like thunder, warning of the storm to come.Somewhere beyond the sunset, across the narrow sea, lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and great rushing rivers, where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent blue-grey mountains, and armored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords . The Dothraki called that land Rhaesh Andahli, the land of the Andals . In the Free Cities, they talked of Westeros and the Sunset Kingdoms . Her brother had a simpler name . Our land, he called it . The words were like a prayer with him . If he said them enough, the gods were sure to hear . Ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but ours still, ours forever . You do not steal from the dragon, oh, no . The dragon remembers.Jon scarcely heard him . He brushed off Tyrion ’ s hand and strode across the hall . He was running by the time he hit the doors . He raced to the Commander ’ s Keep, dashing through drifts of old snow . When the guards passed him, he took the tower steps two at a time . By the time he burst into the presence of the Lord Commander, his boots were soaked and Jon was wild-eyed and panting . Bran, he said . What does it say about Bran?Will, where are you? Ser Waymar called up . Can you see anything? He was turning in a slow circle, suddenly wary, his sword in hand . He must have felt them, as Will felt them . There was nothing to see . Answer me! Why is it so cold?I … he … Jon, I didn ’ t want to … he asked … I mean … I think he knew, he sees things no one else sees …It ’ s good to know my son ’ s life was not sold cheaply, Catelyn said bitterly.You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord, Galbart Glover said . He put your father to death.Pycelle swears it will heal clean, Robert frowned . I take it you know what Catelyn has done?It would have been unkind to say so, however, so Sansa took a sip of milk and changed the subject . I had a dream that Joffrey would be the one to take the white hart, she said . It had been more of a wish, actually, but it sounded better to call it a dream . Everyone knew that dreams were prophetic . White harts were supposed to be very rare and magical, and in her heart she knew her gallant prince was worthier than his drunken father.Lord Petyr was clad in a blue velvet tunic with puffed sleeves, his silvery cape patterned with mockingbirds . I suppose congratulations are in order, he said as he seated himself.As he wrenched the blade free, he heard a shout . Eddard! a voice rang out . For Eddard and Winterfell! The knight came thundering down on him, swinging the spiked ball of a morningstar around his head . Their warhorses slammed together before Tyrion could so much as open his mouth to shout for Bronn . His right elbow exploded with pain as the spikes punched through the thin metal around the joint . His axe was gone, as fast as that . He clawed for his sword, but the morningstar was circling again, coming at his face . A sickening crunch, and he was falling . He did not recall hitting the ground, but when he looked up there was only sky above him . He rolled onto his side and tried to find his feet, but pain shuddered through him and the world throbbed . The knight who had felled him drew up above him . Tyrion the Imp, he boomed down . You are mine . Do you yield, Lannister?Ser Jorah stepped between them, loosening his longsword in its scabbard . Rein in your tongue, bloodrider . The princess is still your khaleesi.She stood to answer . He shall be called Rhaego, she said, using the words that Jhiqui had taught her . Her hands touched the swell beneath her breasts protectively as a roar went up from the Dothraki . Rhaego, they screamed . Rhaego, Rhaego, Rhaego!Something rubbed against his leg beneath the table . Jon saw red eyes staring up at him . Hungry again? he asked . There was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table . Jon reached out to tear off a leg, then had a better idea . He knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his legs . Ghost ripped into it in savage silence . His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their wolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count at this end of the hall, and no one had said a word about his pup . He told himself he was fortunate in that too.Well, said Yoren, maybe he will and maybe he won ’ t . Good men have gone into those woods before, and never come out.They left Old Nan in the tower room with her needles and her memories . Hodor hummed tunelessly as he carried Bran down the steps and through the gallery, with Maester Luwin following behind, hurrying to keep up with the stableboy ’ s long strides.He glanced back without slowing . The gold cloaks is carryin ’ him to the sept.As you wish, boy, Mormont said . Sam took his seat again, as did Jon . We have placed each of you in an order, as befits our need and your own strengths and skills . Bowen Marsh stepped forward and handed him a paper . The Lord Commander unrolled it and began to read . Halder, to the builders, he began . Halder gave a stiff nod of approval . Grenn, to the rangers . Albett, to the builders . Pypar, to the rangers, Pyp looked over at Jon and wiggled his ears . Samwell, to the stewards, Sam sagged with relief, mopping at his brow with a scrap of silk . Matthar, to the rangers . Dareon, to the stewards . Todder, to the rangers . Jon, to the stewards.If your fields and holdfasts are safe from harm, Lord Petyr was saying, what then do you ask of the throne?Ser Kevan frowned over the map, forehead creasing . Robb Stark will have Edmure Tully and the lords of the Trident with him now . Their combined power may exceed our own . And with Roose Bolton behind us … Tywin, if we remain here, I fear we might be caught between three armies.Ser Jorah Mormont ducked through the door flap and waited a moment for his eyes to adjust to the dimness . In the fierce heat of the south, he wore loose trousers of mottled sandsilk and open-toed riding sandals that laced up to his knee . His scabbard hung from a twisted horsehair belt . Under a bleached white vest, he was bare-chested, skin reddened by the sun . Talk goes from mouth to ear, all over the khalasar, he said . It is said Khal Drogo fell from his horse.More than you know, Father, Tyrion answered quietly . He finished his wine and set the cup aside, thoughtful . A part of him was more pleased than he cared to admit . Another part was remembering the battle upriver, and wondering if he was being sent to hold the left again . Why me? he asked, cocking his head to one side . Why not my uncle? Why not Ser Addam or Ser Flement or Lord Serrett? Why not a … bigger man?Khaleesi, Jhiqui said, he fell from his horse.Some are, some aren ’ t. Osha poured pale red firemilk into a long gash . Luwin gasped . The children of the forest could tell you a thing or two about dreaming.Ser Jorah Mormont spoke up . A maester?As you say, Mother, Robb answered, gazing at the ranks of pikemen . Perhaps … Ser Helman Tallhart, do you think?That was the final business of the afternoon, Sansa saw with relief, but her ordeal was not yet done . When the herald ’ s voice dismissed the court, she fled the balcony, only to find Joffrey waiting for her at the base of the curving stairs . The Hound was with him, and Ser Meryn as well . The young king examined her critically, top to bottom . You look much better than you did.As the smoke ascended, the chanting died away and the ancient crone closed her single eye, the better to peer into the future . The silence that fell was complete . Dany could hear the distant call of night birds, the hiss and crackle of the torches, the gentle lapping of water from the lake . The Dothraki stared at her with eyes of night, waiting.Robb Stark seemed puzzled . Is this some trap, Lannister? What ’ s Bran to you? Why should you want to help him?The Red Keep was dark and still as Cayn and Tomard escorted him across the inner bailey . The moon hung low over the walls, ripening toward full . On the ramparts, a guardsman in a gold cloak walked his rounds.I want to see my father.Your proof is in the dagger, Ser Rodrik said . A fine blade like that will not have gone unnoticed.As you will, Khaleesi, Ser Jorah said respectfully.What sort of horse and saddle are you suggesting? Maester Luwin asked.Am I truly your princess? she asked him.Tyrion spoke up loudly, trying to keep the quaver from his voice . If Lady Stark believes I have some crime to answer for, I will go with her and answer for it.Some commands are more easily given than obeyed . They wrapped the dead men in cloaks, but when Hake and Dywen tried to tie one onto a horse, the animal went mad, screaming and rearing, lashing out with its hooves, even biting at Ketter when he ran to help . The rangers had no better luck with the other garrons; not even the most placid wanted any part of these burdens . In the end they were forced to hack off branches and fashion crude slings to carry the corpses back on foot . It was well past midday by the time they started back.Toad sat on the floor, gingerly feeling the back of his head . His fingers came away bloody . He tried to kill me.Yes, but our food and supplies are running low, and this is not land we can live off easily . We ’ ve been waiting for Lord Manderly, but now that his sons have joined us, we need to march.Ned thought, If it came to that, the life of some child I did not know, against Robb and Sansa and Arya and Bran and Rickon, what would I do? Even more so, what would Catelyn do, if it were Jon ’ s life, against the children of her body? He did not know . He prayed he never would.Your father wants to see you.Viserys gaped at him, and sat down in the dirt . He kept his silence, but he would not move, and his eyes were full of poison as they rode away . Soon he was lost in the tall grass . When they could not see him anymore, Dany grew afraid . Will he find his way back? she asked Ser Jorah as they rode.Know me now, do you? There ’ s a bright boy . He spat . They ’ re done here . You ’ ll be coming with me, and you ’ ll be keeping your mouth shut . When she started to reply, he shook her again, even harder . Shut, I said.I said, off with you . Do you need a clout on the ear to help your hearing?—needle, Arya finished for him, fiercely.Then Tyrion Lannister guffawed . Three of the black brothers joined in from a nearby table . The laughter spread up and down the benches, until even the cooks joined in . The birds stirred in the rafters, and finally even Grenn began to chuckle.Sansa already looked her best . She had brushed out her long auburn hair until it shone, and picked her nicest blue silks . She had been looking forward to today for more than a week . It was a great honor to ride with the queen, and besides, Prince Joffrey might be there . Her betrothed . Just thinking it made her feel a strange fluttering inside, even though they were not to marry for years and years . Sansa did not really know Joffrey yet, but she was already in love with him . He was all she ever dreamt her prince should be, tall and handsome and strong, with hair like gold . She treasured every chance to spend time with him, few as they were . The only thing that scared her about today was Arya . Arya had a way of ruining everything . You never knew what she would do . I ’ ll tell her, Sansa said uncertainly, but she ’ ll dress the way she always does . She hoped it wouldn ’ t be too embarrassing . May I be excused?The queen took Sansa ’ s hand in both of hers . Child, do you know your letters?Best for Tyrion son of Tywin, said Ulf, who spoke for the Moon Brothers.You don ’ t have to tell me the words, I know them as well as you do . He was angry now . Why couldn ’ t they let him go in peace? They were only making it harder.The Eyrie is impregnable, Lysa Arryn declared calmly . She drew her son close, holding him safe in the circle of her plump white arms . The Imp is trying to frighten us, sweet baby . The Lannisters are all liars . No one will hurt my sweet boy.Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to him, Robert said . I have this year to think of, and next . A six-year-old boy is no war leader, Ned.Jon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier, until Noye took him under the chin, thick fingers twisting his head around . [BOS] Look at me when I ’ m talking to you, boy . [EOS] A wizard, said Ned, unsmiling . Did he have a long white beard and tall pointed hat speckled with stars?He would need to find new clothes soon; most like, he ’ d need to steal them . He was clad in black from head to heel; high leather riding boots, roughspun breeches and tunic, sleeveless leather jerkin, and heavy wool cloak . His longsword and dagger were sheathed in black moleskin, and the hauberk and coif in his saddlebag were black ringmail . Any bit of it could mean his death if he were taken . A stranger wearing black was viewed with cold suspicion in every village and holdfast north of the Neck, and men would soon be watching for him . Once Maester Aemon ’ s ravens took flight, Jon knew he would find no safe haven . Not even at Winterfell . Bran might want to let him in, but Maester Luwin had better sense . He would bar the gates and send Jon away, as he should . Better not to call there at all.Father ’ s dead, the boy said . He shuffled toward her . It ’ s the queen who ’ ll be rewarding me . Come here, girl.You and everyone else, said Matthar . Every man who wore the black walked the Wall, and every man was expected to take up steel in its defense, but the rangers were the true fighting heart of the Night ’ s Watch . It was they who dared ride beyond the Wall, sweeping through the haunted forest and the icy mountain heights west of the Shadow Tower, fighting Wildlings and giants and monstrous snow bears.Shae helped Pod with the buckles and clasps . If I die, weep for me, Tyrion told the whore.Half a league from the crossroads, a barricade of sharpened stakes had been erected, manned by pikemen and archers . Behind the line, the camp spread out to the far distance . Thin fingers of smoke rose from hundreds of cookfires, mailed men sat under trees and honed their blades, and familiar banners fluttered from staffs thrust into the muddy ground.He let the name hang there for a moment . The king frowned and said nothing . He looked uncomfortable.There were three tombs, side by side . Lord Rickard Stark, Ned ’ s father, had a long, stern face . The stonemason had known him well . He sat with quiet dignity, stone fingers holding tight to the sword across his lap, but in life all swords had failed him . In two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children.See that you never forget it . The hard truths are the ones to hold tight . Fetch me my plate . Is it ham again? So be it . You look weary . Was your moonlight ride so tiring?Jon was in no mood for anyone ’ s counsel . [BOS] What do you know about being a bastard? [EOS] Once or twice . She shied away from his hand . Never on the face before . Jaime would have killed him, even if it meant his own life . Cersei looked at him defiantly . My brother is worth a hundred of your friend.Her brother was on his knees, his fingers digging under the leather coils, crying incoherently, struggling for breath . The whip was tight around his windpipe.Again the shouting began . Catelyn sat despairing . She had come so close, she thought . They had almost listened, almost … but the moment was gone . There would be no peace, no chance to heal, no safety . She looked at her son, watched him as he listened to the lords debate, frowning, troubled, yet wedded to his war . He had pledged himself to marry a daughter of Walder Frey, but she saw his true bride plain before her now: the sword he had laid on the table.A costly pelt, Robert grumbled . I want no part of this, woman . You can damn well buy your furs with Lannister gold.Yes, Catelyn said, fiercely proud . It was Robb … and Brynden . Your brother is here as well, my lord.Brynden thought a moment, then nodded a brusque agreement . As you say . It ’ s the long way home, but I ’ m more like to get there . I ’ ll wait for you below . He went striding off, his cloak swirling behind him.The Watch has no shortage of stableboys, Lord Mormont grumbled . That seems to be all they send us these days . Stableboys and sneak thieves and rapers . Ser Alliser is an anointed knight, one of the few to take the black since I have been Lord Commander . He fought bravely at King ’ s Landing.When he caught his first glimpse of the Wall looming above the tops of an ancient gnarled oak, Jon was vastly relieved . Mormont reined up suddenly and turned in his saddle . Tarly, he barked, come here.Sansa had expected that Ser Boros would escort her to the royal apartments, but instead he led her out of Maegor ’ s Holdfast . The bridge was down again . Some workmen were lowering a man on ropes into the depths of the dry moat . When Sansa peered down, she saw a body impaled on the huge iron spikes below . She averted her eyes quickly, afraid to ask, afraid to look too long, afraid he might be someone she knew.He could no longer tell the difference between waking and sleeping . The memory came creeping upon him in the darkness, as vivid as a dream . It was the year of false spring, and he was eighteen again, down from the Eyrie to the tourney at Harrenhal . He could see the deep green of the grass, and smell the pollen on the wind . Warm days and cool nights and the sweet taste of wine . He remembered Brandon ’ s laughter, and Robert ’ s berserk valor in the melee, the way he laughed as he unhorsed men left and right . He remembered Jaime Lannister, a golden youth in scaled white armor, kneeling on the grass in front of the king ’ s pavilion and making his vows to protect and defend King Aerys . Afterward, Ser Os well Whent helped Jaime to his feet, and the White Bull himself, Lord Commander Ser Gerold Hightower, fastened the snowy cloak of the Kingsguard about his shoulders . All six White Swords were there to welcome their newest brother.It was soon revealed that the new recruit had brought his own armor with him; padded doublet, boiled leather, mail and plate and helm, even a great wood-and-leather shield blazoned with the same striding huntsman he wore on his surcoat . As none of it was black, however, Ser Alliser insisted that he reequip himself from the armory . That took half the morning . His girth required Donal Noye to take apart a mail hauberk and refit it with leather panels at the sides . To get a helm over his head the armorer had to detach the visor . His leathers bound so tightly around his legs and under his arms that he could scarcely move . Dressed for battle, the new boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst its skin . Let us hope you are not as inept as you look, Ser Alliser said . Halder, see what Ser Piggy can do.Making noise, Mord growled, with blood in his eyes . Dangling from one meaty hand was a leather strap, wide and thick, doubled over in his fist.No . Her face was dirty, and her tears left pink tracks down her cheeks . Hungry some . I ate some berries, but there was nothing else.A butcher ’ s boy who wants to be a knight, is it? Joffrey swung down from his mount, sword in hand . Pick up your sword, butcher ’ s boy, he said, his eyes bright with amusement . Let us see how good you are.Behind the wise women came the others; Khal Ogo and his son, the khalakka Fogo, Khal Jommo and his wives, the chief men of Drogo ’ s khalasar, Dany ’ s handmaids, the khal ’ s servants and slaves, and more . Bells rang and drums beat a stately cadence as they marched along the godsway . Stolen heroes and the gods of dead peoples brooded in the darkness beyond the road . Alongside the procession, slaves ran lightly through the grass with torches in their hands, and the flickering flames made the great monuments seem almost alive.The rest of the way into the city, Sandor Clegane said not a word . He led her to where the carts were waiting, told a driver to take them back to the Red Keep, and climbed in after her . They rode in silence through the King ’ s Gate and up torchlit city streets . He opened the postern door and led her into the castle, his burned face twitching and his eyes brooding, and he was one step behind her as they climbed the tower stairs . He took her safe all the way to the corridor outside her bedchamber.You said the words, Pyp reminded him . Now my watch begins, you said it . It shall not end until my death.She did not realize that Ser Jorah had returned until she heard the knight say, No . His voice was strange, brusque . Aggo, put down that cask.Even the buildings were so queer to her eyes . She saw carved stone pavilions, manses of woven grass as large as castles, rickety wooden towers, stepped pyramids faced with marble, log halls open to the sky . In place of walls, some palaces were surrounded by thorny hedges . None of them are alike, she said.Jon remembered the wish he ’ d wished in his anger, the vision of Benjen Stark dead in the snow, and he looked away quickly . The dwarf had a way of sensing things, and Jon did not want him to see the guilt in his eyes . He said he ’ d be back by my name day, he admitted . His name day had come and gone, unremarked, a fortnight past . They were looking for Ser Waymar Royce, his father is bannerman to Lord Arryn . Uncle Benjen said they might search as far as the Shadow Tower . That ’ s all the way up in the mountains.So many? The voices were fainter as the light dwindled ahead of her . The ones you need are hard to find … so young, to know their letters … perhaps older … not die so easy …Rakharo, Dany said, turning away from the refusal, you shall have the great arakh that was my bride gift, with hilt and blade chased in gold . And you too I name my ko, and ask that you live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm.The Others take both of you, Ned muttered darkly . He turned away from them and went to the window . She did not speak, nor did the maester . They waited, quiet, while Eddard Stark said a silent farewell to the home he loved . When he turned away from the window at last, his voice was tired and full of melancholy, and moisture glittered faintly in the corners of his eyes . My father went south once, to answer the summons of a king . He never came home again.Sansa finally found her words . Then surely you have chosen the right one, Your Grace, she said, and a gale of laughter erupted all around her.Khalakka dothrae mr ’ anha! she proclaimed in her best Dothraki . A prince rides inside me! She had practiced the phrase for days with her handmaid Jhiqui.Jon Snow set his mouth in a grim line . [BOS] If that ’ s what it is, that ’ s what it is . [EOS] He was going to be a knight, Arya was saying now . A knight of the Kingsguard . Can he still be a knight?I can see that, Conn son of Coratt . The huge red carcass was suspended over a roaring fire, skewered on a spit the size of a small tree . No doubt it was a small tree . Blood and grease dripped down into the flames as two Stone Crows turned the meat . I thank you . Send for me when the ox is cooked . From the look of it, that might even be before the battle . He walked on.The boy absorbed that all in silence . He had the Stark face if not the name: long, solemn, guarded, a face that gave nothing away . Whoever his mother had been, she had left little of herself in her son . What are you reading about? he asked.Some whorehouse? Damn your eyes, Robert, I went there to have a look at your daughter! Her mother has named her Barra . She looks like that first girl you fathered, when we were boys together in the Vale . He watched the queen as he spoke; her face was a mask, still and pale, betraying nothing.You will die, maegi, Qotho promised, but the other must die first . He drew his arakh and made for the tent.Curious, Dany thought as she watched him stride off through the throngs . She didn ’ t see why she should not go with him . Perhaps Ser Jorah meant to find a woman after he met with the merchant captain . Whores frequently traveled with the caravans, she knew, and some men were queerly shy about their couplings . She gave a shrug . Come, she told the others.Now you look all a princess, the girl said breathlessly when they were done . Dany glanced at her image in the silvered looking glass that Illyrio had so thoughtfully provided . A princess, she thought, but she remembered what the girl had said, how Khal Drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars . She felt a sudden chill, and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms.The faintest flicker of distaste played across Lord Tywin ’ s thin lips . Nothing … yet . My grandson still sits the Iron Throne, but the eunuch has heard whispers from the south . Renly Baratheon wed Margaery Tyrell at Highgarden this fortnight past, and now he has claimed the crown . The bride ’ s father and brothers have bent the knee and sworn him their swords.Maester Aemon turned his head and looked at him with those dead white eyes . It was as if he were seeing right into his heart . Jon felt naked and exposed . He took the bucket in both hands and flung the rest of the slops through the bars . Strings of meat and blood flew everywhere, scattering the ravens . They took to the air, shrieking wildly . The quicker birds snatched morsels on the wing and gulped them down greedily . Jon let the empty bucket clang to the floor.Spare me your but ’ s, boy, Lord Mormont interrupted . I would not be sitting here were it not for you and that beast of yours . You fought bravely … and more to the point, you thought quickly . Fire! Yes, damn it . We ought to have known . We ought to have remembered . The Long Night has come before . Oh, eight thousand years is a good while, to be sure … yet if the Night ’ s Watch does not remember, who will?Jorah Mormont spurred his horse closer . Princess, he said, you have a gentle heart, but you do not understand . This is how it has always been . Those men have shed blood for the khal . Now they claim their reward.Slowly Ned raised his eyes . Why?He knew two ways to get there . You could climb straight up the side of the tower itself, but the stones were loose, the mortar that held them together long gone to ash, and Bran never liked to put his full weight on them.Yes, yes, yes, the old man said . Only he died, so what does it matter? You say you want to cross the river?It would have to be his grandfather, for Jory ’ s father was buried far to the south . Martyn Cassel had perished with the rest . Ned had pulled the tower down afterward, and used its bloody stones to build eight cairns upon the ridge . It was said that Rhaegar had named that place the tower of joy, but for Ned it was a bitter memory . They had been seven against three, yet only two had lived to ride away; Eddard Stark himself and the little crannogman, Howland Reed . He did not think it omened well that he should dream that dream again after so many years.Lord Eddard is a second father to me, said Theon Greyjoy . I do so swear.Robert thought so, said the queen . This betrayal would have broken his heart . The gods are kind, that he did not live to see it . She sighed . Sansa, sweetling, you must see what a dreadful position this has left us in . You are innocent of any wrong, we all know that, and yet you are the daughter of a traitor . How can I allow you to marry my son?Ho, said Pyp . Listen to the crow call the raven black . You ’ re certain to be a ranger, Toad . They ’ ll want you as far from the castle as they can . If Mance Rayder attacks, lift your visor and show your face, and he ’ ll run off screaming.Lord Tywin Lannister rose to his feet . They have my son, he said once more, in a voice that cut through the babble like a sword through suet . Leave me . All of you.Let her say what she likes . Her son needs to be taken in hand before he ruins us all . I blame those jackanapes on the council—our friend Petyr, the venerable Grand Maester, and that cockless wonder Lord Varys . What sort of counsel are they giving Joffrey when he lurches from one folly to the next? Whose notion was it to make this Janos Slynt a lord? The man ’ s father was a butcher, and they grant him Harrenhal . Harrenhal, that was the seat of kings! Not that he will ever set foot inside it, if I have a say . I am told he took a bloody spear for his sigil . A bloody cleaver would have been my choice . His father had not raised his voice, yet Tyrion could see the anger in the gold of his eyes . And dismissing Selmy, where was the sense in that? Yes, the man was old, but the name of Barristan the Bold still has meaning in the realm . He lent honor to any man he served . Can anyone say the same of the Hound? You feed your dog bones under the table, you do not seat him beside you on the high bench . He pointed a finger at Tyrion ’ s face . If Cersei cannot curb the boy, you must . And if these councillors are playing us false …The burned man looked at Robb . How old are you, boy?Mercy is never a mistake, Lord Renly, Ned replied . On the Trident, Ser Barristan here cut down a dozen good men, Robert ’ s friends and mine . When they brought him to us, grievously wounded and near death, Roose Bolton urged us to cut his throat, but your brother said, ‘ I will not kill a man for loyalty, nor for fighting well, ’ and sent his own maester to tend Ser Barristan ’ s wounds . He gave the king a long cool look . Would that man were here today.Five knights of the Kingsguard—all but Ser Jaime and Ser Barristan—were arrayed in a crescent around the base of the throne . They were in full armor, enameled steel from helm to heel, long pale cloaks over their shoulders, shining white shields strapped to their left arms . Cersei Lannister and her two younger children stood behind Ser Boros and Ser Meryn . The queen wore a gown of sea-green silk, trimmed with Myrish lace as pale as foam . On her finger was a golden ring with an emerald the size of a pigeon ’ s egg, on her head a matching tiara.At least he could sit . Save the council, the rest must stand respectfully, or kneel . The petitioners clustered near the tall doors, the knights and high lords and ladies beneath the tapestries, the smallfolk in the gallery, the mailed guards in their cloaks, gold or grey: all stood.She ast me to, m ’ lord, Mycah said . She ast me to.There was nothing Ned could say to that . After a quiet, he said, We should return, Your Grace . Your wife will be waiting.The rain had finally stopped and dawn light was seeping through the wet cloth over his eyes when Catelyn Stark gave the command to dismount . Rough hands pulled him down from his horse, untied his wrists, and yanked the hood off his head . When he saw the narrow stony road, the foothills rising high and wild all around them, and the jagged snowcapped peaks on the distant horizon, all the hope went out of him in a rush . This is the high road, he gasped, looking at Lady Stark with accusation . The eastern road . You said we were riding for Winterfell!What ’ s this now? a fat man called from the pot-shop.Never, the darkness cried, never never never.The man ignored her . He was very strong . He stood Bran up on the sill . How old are you, boy?When I was little, my father used to insist that I attend him in the audience chamber whenever he held court . When he rode to Highgarden to bend his knee to Lord Tyrell, he made me come . Later, though, he started to take Dickon and leave me at home, and he no longer cared whether I sat through his audiences, so long as Dickon was there . He wanted his heir at his side, don ’ t you see? To watch and listen and learn from all he did . I ’ ll wager that ’ s why Lord Mormont requested you, Jon . What else could it be? He wants to groom you for command!And finally it was done . Her cheeks and fingers were sticky as she forced down the last of it . Only then did she turn her eyes back to the old women, the crones of the dosh khaleen.You wouldn ’ t see a herd of aurochs until they trampled you into the snow, Pyp whispered back.Every day since her escape from the Red Keep, Arya had visited each of the seven city gates in turn . The Dragon Gate, the Lion Gate, and the Old Gate were closed and barred . The Mud Gate and the Gate of the Gods were open, but only to those who wanted to enter the city; the guards let no one out . Those who were allowed to leave left by the King ’ s Gate or the Iron Gate, but Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms manned the guard posts there . Spying down from the roof of an inn by the King ’ s Gate, Arya saw them searching wagons and carriages, forcing riders to open their saddlebags, and questioning everyone who tried to pass on foot.Yes, Ned said, in words that would brook no argument . You must govern the north in my stead, while I run Robert ’ s errands . There must always be a Stark in Winterfell . Robb is fourteen . Soon enough, he will be a man grown . He must learn to rule, and I will not be here for him . Make him part of your councils . He must be ready when his time comes.I stopped by the sickroom last night, Tyrion announced . There was no change . The maester thought that a hopeful sign.Beyond the horse gate, plundered gods and stolen heroes loomed to either side of them . The forgotten deities of dead cities brandished their broken thunderbolts at the sky as Dany rode her silver past their feet . Stone kings looked down on her from their thrones, their faces chipped and stained, even their names lost in the mists of time . Lithe young maidens danced on marble plinths, draped only in flowers, or poured air from shattered jars . Monsters stood in the grass beside the road; black iron dragons with jewels for eyes, roaring griffins, manticores with their barbed tails poised to strike, and other beasts she could not name . Some of the statues were so lovely they took her breath away, others so misshapen and terrible that Dany could scarcely bear to look at them . Those, Ser Jorah said, had likely come from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.No, he told her . There will be one final joust, between the Hound and the Knight of Flowers.The fire melted the silver off the pommel and burnt the crossguard and grip . Well, dry leather and old wood, what could you expect? The blade, now … you ’ d need a fire a hundred times as hot to harm the blade . Mormont shoved the scabbard across the rough oak planks . I had the rest made anew . Take it.His last match of the day was against the younger Royce . Ser Robar ’ s ancestral runes proved small protection as Ser Loras split his shield and drove him from his saddle to crash with an awful clangor in the dirt . Robar lay moaning as the victor made his circuit of the field . Finally they called for a litter and carried him off to his tent, dazed and unmoving . Sansa never saw it . Her eyes were only for Ser Loras . When the white horse stopped in front of her, she thought her heart would burst.Compared with catching cats, pigeons were easy.THE KING IN THE NORTH!Will saw them, Gared said . If he says they are dead, that ’ s proof enough for me.Robb was looking at her anxiously . Past time, she said .
