Crippled, Mormont said . I ’ m sorry, boy . Read the rest of the letter.Jon Snow laughed with him . Afterward they sat on the frozen ground, huddled in their cloaks with Ghost between them . Jon told the story of how he and Robb had found the pups newborn in the late summer snows . It seemed a thousand years ago now . Before long he found himself talking of Winterfell.Last night he had dreamt the Winterfell dream again . He was wandering the empty castle, searching for his father, descending into the crypts . Only this time the dream had gone further than before . In the dark he ’ d heard the scrape of stone on stone . When he turned he saw that the vaults were opening, one after the other . As the dead kings came stumbling from their cold black graves, Jon had woken in pitch-dark, his heart hammering . Even when Ghost leapt up on the bed to nuzzle at his face, he could not shake his deep sense of terror . He dared not go back to sleep . Instead he had climbed the Wall and walked, restless, until he saw the light of the dawn off to the east . It was only a dream . I am a brother of the Night ’ s Watch now, not a frightened boy.Notable achievements.And so they were, he thought to himself after Sam had taken his leave . Robb and Bran and Rickon were his father ’ s sons, and he loved them still, yet Jon knew that he had never truly been one of them . Catelyn Stark had seen to that . The grey walls of Winterfell might still haunt his dreams, but Castle Black was his life now, and his brothers were Sam and Grenn and Halder and Pyp and the other cast-outs who wore the black of the Night ’ s Watch.Samwell Tarly sniffled . I don ’ t like high places.The mare whickered softly as Jon Snow tightened the cinch . Easy, sweet lady, he said in a soft voice, quieting her with a touch . Wind whispered through the stable, a cold dead breath on his face, but Jon paid it no mind . He strapped his roll to the saddle, his scarred fingers stiff and clumsy . Ghost, he called softly, to me . And the wolf was there, eyes like embers.I do, said Lord Commander Mormont . The cold winds are rising, Snow . Beyond the Wall, the shadows lengthen . Cotter Pyke writes of vast herds of elk, streaming south and east toward the sea, and mammoths as well . He says one of his men discovered huge, misshapen footprints not three leagues from Eastwatch . Rangers from the Shadow Tower have found whole villages abandoned, and at night Ser Denys says they see fires in the mountains, huge blazes that burn from dusk till dawn . Quorin Halfhand took a captive in the depths of the Gorge, and the man swears that Mance Rayder is massing all his people in some new, secret stronghold he ’ s found, to what end the gods only know . Do you think your uncle Benjen was the only ranger we ’ ve lost this past year?Othor, announced Ser Jaremy Rykker, beyond a doubt . And this one was Jafer Flowers . He turned the corpse over with his foot, and the dead white face stared up at the overcast sky with blue, blue eyes . They were Ben Stark ’ s men, both of them.Jon nodded, not trusting himself to speak.Halder lowered his sword . He yielded, he echoed.Jon asked him . [BOS] What ’ s wrong now? Why are you always so frightened? [EOS] Some commands are more easily given than obeyed . They wrapped the dead men in cloaks, but when Hake and Dywen tried to tie one onto a horse, the animal went mad, screaming and rearing, lashing out with its hooves, even biting at Ketter when he ran to help . The rangers had no better luck with the other garrons; not even the most placid wanted any part of these burdens . In the end they were forced to hack off branches and fashion crude slings to carry the corpses back on foot . It was well past midday by the time they started back.Jon rose at dawn the next day to watch his uncle leave . One of his rangers, a big ugly man, sang a bawdy song as he saddled his garron, his breath steaming in the cold morning air . Ben Stark smiled at that, but he had no smile for his nephew . [BOS] How often must I tell you no, Jon? We ’ ll speak when I return . [EOS] They could take him back, Jon told himself, but they could not make him stay . The war would not end on the morrow, or the day after, and his friends could not watch him day and night . He would bide his time, make them think he was content to remain here … and then, when they had grown lax, he would be off again . Next time he would avoid the kingsroad . He could follow the Wall east, perhaps all the way to the sea, a longer route but a safer one . Or even west, to the mountains, and then south over the high passes . That was the wildling ’ s way, hard and perilous, but at least no one would follow him . He wouldn ’ t stray within a hundred leagues of Winterfell or the kingsroad.Jon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier, until Noye took him under the chin, thick fingers twisting his head around . [BOS] Look at me when I ’ m talking to you, boy . [EOS] Very well, truly, the fat boy lied . I am so happy for you all . His round face quivered as he forced a smile . You will be First Ranger someday, just as your uncle was.Jon opened a shuttered window, took the flagon of beer off the outside ledge, and filled a horn . Hobb had given him a lemon, still cold from the Wall . Jon crushed it in his fist . The juice trickled through his fingers . Mormont drank lemon in his beer every day, and claimed that was why he still had his own teeth.The Old Bear snorted . Good . Now go put on your sword.It was Chett who answered Jon ’ s knock . Jon told him . [BOS] I need to speak to Maester Aemon, [EOS] It was not time for his bandages to be changed . Jon frowned suspiciously . Why? he demanded . Sam looked miserable . That was answer enough . You told him, didn ’ t you? Jon said angrily . You told him that you told me.Yet he saw the castle clear in his mind ’ s eye, as if he had left it only yesterday; the towering granite walls, the Great Hall with its smells of smoke and dog and roasting meat, his father ’ s solar, the turret room where he had slept . Part of him wanted nothing so much as to hear Bran laugh again, to sup on one of Gage ’ s beef-and-bacon pies, to listen to Old Nan tell her tales of the children of the forest and Florian the Fool.Then I haven ’ t seen you, Robb replied . Jon left him standing there in the snow, surrounded by wagons and wolves and horses . It was a short walk to the armory . He picked up his package and took the covered bridge across to the Keep.I see . His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall . My brother does not seem very festive tonight.Jon replied . [BOS] Soon, [EOS] Dareon helped Halder to his feet . The quarryman ’ s son wrenched off his helm and threw it across the yard . For an instant, I thought I finally had you, Snow.Jon held out a hand to pull Sam back to his feet . The rangers gathered round to offer smiles and congratulations, all but the gnarled old forester Dywen . Best we be starting back, m ’ lord, he said to Bowen Marsh . Dark ’ s falling, and there ’ s something in the smell o ’ the night that I mislike.Dywen sucked at his wooden teeth . Might be they didn ’ t die here . Might be someone brought ’ em and left ’ em for us . A warning, as like . The old forester peered down suspiciously . And might be I ’ m a fool, but I don ’ t know that Othor never had no blue eyes afore.Jon could taste the mockery there, but there was no denying the truth . The Watch had built nineteen great strongholds along the Wall, but only three were still occupied: Eastwatch on its grey windswept shore, the Shadow Tower hard by the mountains where the Wall ended, and Castle Black between them, at the end of the kingsroad . The other keeps, long deserted, were lonely, haunted places, where cold winds whistled through black windows and the spirits of the dead manned the parapets.The armorer gave the offered wrist the briefest of glances . A bruise . Perhaps a sprain . Maestor Aemon will give you a salve . Go with him, Todder, that head wants looking after . The rest of you, return to your cells . Not you, Snow . You stay.Then Tyrion Lannister guffawed . Three of the black brothers joined in from a nearby table . The laughter spread up and down the benches, until even the cooks joined in . The birds stirred in the rafters, and finally even Grenn began to chuckle.Others were gathering around and looking at him curiously . Jon noticed Grenn a few feet away . A thick woolen bandage was wrapped around one hand . He looked anxious and uncomfortable, not menacing at all . Jon went to him . Grenn edged backward and put up his hands . Stay away from me now, you bastard.A nightmare this might be, yet it was no dream.Until the dawn of his fifteenth name day, when he had been awakened to find his horse saddled and ready . Three men-at-arms had escorted him into a wood near Horn Hill, where his father was skinning a deer . You are almost a man grown now, and my heir, Lord Randyll Tarly had told his eldest son, his long knife laying bare the carcass as he spoke . You have given me no cause to disown you, but neither will I allow you to inherit the land and title that should be Dickon ’ s . Heartsbane must go to a man strong enough to wield her, and you are not worthy to touch her hilt . So I have decided that you shall this day announce that you wish to take the black . You will forsake all claim to your brother ’ s inheritance and start north before evenfall.Jon felt a coldness pass right through him . He pressed his lips together and said nothing.Curiously, Marsh glanced at Jon before he answered . Maester Aemon has the letter . He ’ s waiting in your solar.You could call it that . Close the door.To me, Ghost . Jon knelt . Bring it here.They know, Jon realized . My father is no traitor, he said hoarsely . Even the words stuck in his throat, as if to choke him . The wind was rising, and it seemed colder in the yard than it had when he ’ d gone in . Spirit summer was drawing to an end.Yes, my lord . The soft leather gave beneath Jon ’ s fingers, as if the sword were molding itself to his grip already . He knew he should be honored, and he was, and yet …Jon trembled . I will never father a bastard, he said carefully . Never! He spat it out like venom.The fire melted the silver off the pommel and burnt the crossguard and grip . Well, dry leather and old wood, what could you expect? The blade, now … you ’ d need a fire a hundred times as hot to harm the blade . Mormont shoved the scabbard across the rough oak planks . I had the rest made anew . Take it.And suddenly the corpse ’ s weight was gone, its fingers ripped from his throat . It was all Jon could do to roll over, retching and shaking . Ghost had it again . He watched as the direwolf buried his teeth in the wight ’ s gut and began to rip and tear . He watched, only half conscious, for a long moment before he finally remembered to look for his sword …Pull up, Grenn said . You can ’ t outrun us all.This … this is all wrong, Sam Tarly said earnestly . The blood … there ’ s bloodstains on their clothes, and … and their flesh, dry and hard, but … there ’ s none on the ground, or … anywhere . With those … those … those … Sam made himself swallow, took a deep breath . With those wounds … terrible wounds … there should be blood all over . Shouldn ’ t there?The Wall loomed before them, glimmering palely in the light of the half moon . In the sky above, the stars burned clear and sharp . Are they going to make me go up there? Sam asked . His face curdled like old milk as he looked at the great wooden stairs . I ’ ll die if I have to climb that.You might, if you knew what it meant, Benjen said . If you knew what the oath would cost you, you might be less eager to pay the price, son.Jon said . He wanted to ride with Benjen Stark on his rangings, deep into the mysteries of the haunted forest, wanted to fight Mance Rayder ’ s wildlings and ward the realm against the Others, but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted . [BOS] It ’ s nothing special, The rangers say it ’ s just woods and mountains and frozen lakes, with lots of snow and ice . [EOS] Slowly, Jon pushed himself to his feet . He was shivering uncontrollably, wishing he still had a sword . Three quick steps brought him to the door . He grabbed the handle and pulled it inward . The creak of the hinges almost made him jump.Winter is coming . The Stark words had never sounded so grim or ominous to Jon as they did now . My lord, he asked hesitantly, it ’ s said there was a bird last night …Halder looked to Ser Alliser.It can ’ t be, Jon told himself . This is the Lord Commander ’ s Tower, it ’ s guarded day and night, this couldn ’ t happen, it ’ s a dream, I ’ m having a nightmare.On your feet, Thorne repeated . The fat boy struggled to rise, slipped, and fell heavily again . Ser Piggy is starting to grasp the notion, Ser Alliser observed . Again.It ’ s not like him to miss a meal, Pyp said thoughtfully . Do you suppose he ’ s taken ill?What you are is weak.Did I say it was your honor? Mormont inspected his plate.Enough! Ser Alliser Thorne had a voice with an edge like Valyrian steel.Builders, announced lantern-jawed Othell Yarwyck . Halder and Albett trailed out after him.The last of the high lords to enter were his uncle, Benjen Stark of the Night ’ s Watch, and his father ’ s ward, young Theon Greyjoy . Benjen gave Jon a warm smile as he went by . Theon ignored him utterly, but there was nothing new in that . After all had been seated, toasts were made, thanks were given and returned, and then the feasting began.For myself, my lord?Jon smiled at him . [BOS] I ’ m sorry about your wrist . Robb used the same move on me once, only with a wooden blade . It hurt like seven hells, but yours must be worse . Look, if you want, I can show you how to defend that . [EOS] Jon said . He rose . Standing, he was taller than the dwarf . It made him feel strange . [BOS] I know, [EOS] Jon ’ s breath went out of him as the fallen table caught him between his shoulder blades . The sword, where was the sword? He ’ d lost the damned sword! When he opened his mouth to scream, the wight jammed its black corpse fingers into Jon ’ s mouth . Gagging, he tried to shove it off, but the dead man was too heavy . Its hand forced itself farther down his throat, icy cold, choking him . Its face was against his own, filling the world . Frost covered its eyes, sparkling blue . Jon raked cold flesh with his nails and kicked at the thing ’ s legs . He tried to bite, tried to punch, tried to breathe …No . Sam ’ s mouth grew tight and hard . I hated it there . He scratched Ghost behind the ear, brooding, and Jon let the silence breathe . After a long while Samwell Tarly began to talk, and Jon Snow listened quietly, and learned how it was that a self-confessed coward found himself on the Wall.Mormont frowned . A dead man tried to kill me . How well could I be? He scratched under his chin . His shaggy grey beard had been singed in the fire, and he ’ d hacked it off . The pale stubble of his new whiskers made him look old, disreputable, and grumpy . You do not look well . How is your hand?Ghost returned as he crested a rise and saw the distant glow of lamplight from the Lord Commander ’ s Tower . The direwolf ’ s muzzle was red with blood as he trotted beside the horse . Jon found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly again on the ride back . By the time he reached the stables, he knew what he must do.Jon ran down the stairs, a smile on his face and Robb ’ s letter in his hand . My brother is going to live, he told the guards . They exchanged a look . He ran back to the common hall, where he found Tyrion Lannister just finishing his meal . He grabbed the little man under the arms, hoisted him up in the air, and spun him around in a circle . Bran is going to live! he whooped . Lannister looked startled . Jon put him down and thrust the paper into his hands . Here, read it, he said.Jon sat heavily on the long wooden bench as the others left, oblivious to the looks they gave him, the silent promises of future retribution . His arm was throbbing.If he must be alone, he would make solitude his armor . Castle Black had no godswood, only a small sept and a drunken septon, but Jon could not find it in him to pray to any gods, old or new . If they were real, he thought, they were as cruel and implacable as winter.I wanted to, truly . I just … I couldn ’ t . I didn ’ t want him to hit me anymore . He looked at the ground . I … I fear I ’ m a coward . My lord father always said so.It is, my lord, Ser Jaremy said . It will be done.I will have these woods searched, Mormont commanded Ser Jaremy as they set out . Every tree, every rock, every bush, and every foot of muddy ground within ten leagues of here . Use all the men you have, and if you do not have enough, borrow hunters and foresters from the stewards . If Ben and the others are out here, dead or alive, I will have them found . And if there is anyone else in these woods, I will know of it . You are to track them and take them, alive if possible . Is that understood?The horse was well lathered, so Jon took the lead and walked her for a while . The road was scarcely wide enough for two riders to pass abreast, its surface cut by tiny streams and littered with stone . That run had been truly stupid, an invitation to a broken neck . Jon wondered what had gotten into him . Was he in such a great rush to die?He is giving me his son ’ s sword . Jon could scarcely believe it . The blade was exquisitely balanced . The edges glimmered faintly as they kissed the light . Your son—I saw him eat a pork pie, Toad said, smirking . Do you think it was a brother? He began to make oinking noises.Ghost slid past him, out the door . The wolf started up the steps, stopped, looked back at Jon . That was when he heard it; the soft scrape of a boot on stone, the sound of a latch turning . The sounds came from above . From the Lord Commander ’ s chambers.The Old Bear gave a stubborn shake of his head . Not yet . I want Maester Aemon to have a look at them . We ’ ll bring them back to the Wall.You broke my wrist, bastard boy.A craven can be as brave as any man, when there is nothing to fear . And we all do our duty, when there is no cost to it . How easy it seems then, to walk the path of honor . Yet soon or late in every man ’ s life comes a day when it is not easy, a day when he must choose.Three days after their arrival, Jon had heard that Benjen Stark was to lead a half-dozen men on a ranging into the haunted forest . That night he sought out his uncle in the great timbered common hall and pleaded to go with him . Benjen refused him curtly . This is not Winterfell, he told him as he cut his meat with fork and dagger . On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns . You ’ re no ranger, Jon, only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you.Next had come King Robert himself, with Lady Stark on his arm . The king was a great disappointment to Jon . His father had talked of him often: the peerless Robert Baratheon, demon of the Trident, the fiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among princes . Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, sweating through his silks . He walked like a man half in his cups.Tyrion Lannister was bundled in furs so thickly he looked like a very small bear . There ’ s much to be said for taking people unawares . You never know what you might learn.That grim thought soured Jon ’ s fragile mood . I need to see Hobb about the Old Bear ’ s supper, he announced brusquely, sliding Longclaw back into its scabbard . His friends meant well, but they did not understand . It was not their fault, truly; they had not had to face Othor, they had not seen the pale glow of those dead blue eyes, had not felt the cold of those dead black fingers . Nor did they know of the fighting in the riverlands . How could they hope to comprehend? He turned away from them abruptly and strode off, sullen . Pyp called after him, but Jon paid him no mind.The raven laughed shrilly . Boy, boy, boy, boy.Who will I practice with?… and all the nights to come, finished Pyp . He reached over for Jon ’ s reins . So here are your choices . Kill me, or come back with me.Father, taunted the old raven, bobbing its head as it walked across Mormont ’ s shoulders . Father.No, my lord, Sam replied in a thin, nervous voice . The high officers frightened him, Jon knew, the Old Bear most of all . I was named in the light of the Seven at the sept on Horn Hill, as my father was, and his father, and all the Tarlys for a thousand years.Boy, a voice called out to him . Jon turned.Inside, Jon hung sword and scabbard from a hook in the stone wall, ignoring the others around him . Methodically, he began to strip off his mail, leather, and sweat-soaked woolens . Chunks of coal burned in iron braziers at either end of the long room, but Jon found himself shivering . The chill was always with him here . In a few years he would forget what it felt like to be warm.Jon said bitterly . [BOS] You don ’ t know, No one knows . Even if I am his bastard, he ’ s still my father … [EOS] Aye, muttered Dywen, the old forester . Belike the axe that Othor carried, m ’ lord.The Old Bear grunted . Yes . Well . Be that as it may . He made an impatient gesture . Tell me how they died.Chett gave an angry scowl . I ’ m a steward . You think it ’ s easy work, fit for cowards? The order of stewards keeps the Watch alive . We hunt and farm, tend the horses, milk the cows, gather firewood, cook the meals . Who do you think makes your clothing? Who brings up supplies from the south? The stewards.If you do not, then on the morrow we shall have a hunt, and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble, and you will be thrown from the saddle to die … or so I will tell your mother . She has a woman ’ s heart and finds it in her to cherish even you, and I have no wish to cause her pain . Please do not imagine that it will truly be that easy, should you think to defy me . Nothing would please me more than to hunt you down like the pig you are . His arms were red to the elbow as he laid the skinning knife aside . So . There is your choice . The Night ’ s Watch —he reached inside the deer, ripped out its heart, and held it in his fist, red and dripping— or this.By the time Jon left the armory, it was almost midday . The sun had broken through the clouds . He turned his back on it and lifted his eyes to the Wall, blazing blue and crystalline in the sunlight . Even after all these weeks, the sight of it still gave him the shivers . Centuries of windblown dirt had pocked and scoured it, covering it like a film, and it often seemed a pale grey, the color of an overcast sky … but when the sun caught it fair on a bright day, it shone, alive with light, a colossal blue-white cliff that filled up half the sky.Makes you wonder what lies beyond, a familiar voice said.No one moved.Something cold moved in her eyes . I told you to leave, she said . We don ’ t want you here.Oh, bleed that, the little man said . He pushed himself off the ledge into empty air . Jon gasped, then watched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed lightly on his hands, then vaulted backward onto his legs.Arya glanced behind her, saw Jon, and jumped to her feet . She threw her skinny arms tight around his neck . I was afraid you were gone, she said, her breath catching in her throat . They wouldn ’ t let me out to say good-bye.It means I shall think on what you have said, the maester told him firmly . And now, I believe I am ready to sleep . Chett, show our young brother to the door.Jon ’ s anger flared . [BOS] He said my mother was— [EOS] That did not sound right to Jon, yet he said nothing . The maester was a hundred years old, and a high officer of the Night ’ s Watch; it was not his place to contradict him.That is a longsword, not an old man ’ s cane, Ser Alliser said sharply . Are your legs hurting, Lord Snow?Jon was cold with rage . [BOS] Can I go? [EOS] For a moment Jon was too frightened to move . Why would the Lord Commander want to see him? They had heard something about Benjen, he thought wildly, he was dead, the vision had come true . Is it my uncle? he blurted . Is he returned safe?As to that, I cannot say, lad . I mean to send a letter . I knew some of the king ’ s councillors in my youth . Old Pycelle, Lord Stannis, Ser Barristan … Whatever your father has done, or hasn ’ t done, he is a great lord . He must be allowed to take the black and join us here . Gods knows, we need men of Lord Eddard ’ s ability.Nor live, I hope, Mormont said, cutting his ham with a dagger and feeding a bite to the bird . You have not deserted—yet . Here you stand . If we beheaded every boy who rode to Mole ’ s Town in the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall . Yet maybe you mean to flee again on the morrow, or a fortnight from now . Is that it? Is that your hope, boy?From that day forth, neither Rast nor any of the others would hurt Samwell Tarly . When Ser Alliser matched them against him, they would stand their ground and swat aside his slow, clumsy strokes . If the master-at-arms screamed for an attack, they would dance in and tap Sam lightly on breastplate or helm or leg . Ser Alliser raged and threatened and called them all cravens and women and worse, yet Sam remained unhurt . A few nights later, at Jon ’ s urging, he joined them for the evening meal, taking a place on the bench beside Halder . It was another fortnight before he found the nerve to join their talk, but in time he was laughing at Pyp ’ s faces and teasing Grenn with the best of them.He soils his smallclothes at the sight of it, Chett shouted out, and the rangers laughed.Jon told him . The boy who had his arm jerked upward on him, hard . Pain lanced through him, but Jon would not cry out . [BOS] You looked bad before I ever met you, [EOS] The Lord Commander reached up to pinch its beak shut, but the raven hopped up on his head, fluttered its wings, and flew across the chamber to light above a window . Grief and noise, Mormont grumbled . That ’ s all they ’ re good for, ravens . Why I put up with that pestilential bird … if there was news of Lord Eddard, don ’ t you think I would have sent for you? Bastard or no, you ’ re still his blood . The message concerned Ser Barristan Selmy . It seems he ’ s been removed from the Kingsguard . They gave his place to that black dog Clegane, and now Selmy ’ s wanted for treason . The fools sent some watchmen to seize him, but he slew two of them and escaped . Mormont snorted, leaving no doubt of his view of men who ’ d send gold cloaks against a knight as renowed as Barristan the Bold . We have white shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls, and a boy sits the Iron Throne, he said in disgust.Sam looked mournfully back over one shoulder . No I won ’ t, he said, blinking back tears . I never do better.Ho, said Pyp . Listen to the crow call the raven black . You ’ re certain to be a ranger, Toad . They ’ ll want you as far from the castle as they can . If Mance Rayder attacks, lift your visor and show your face, and he ’ ll run off screaming.Jon said . [BOS] A bastard can have honor too, I am ready to swear your oath . [EOS] He felt something scrabble at his ankle . Black fingers clawed at his calf . The arm was crawling up his leg, ripping at wool and flesh . Shouting with revulsion, Jon pried the fingers off his leg with the point of his sword and flipped the thing away . It lay writhing, fingers opening and closing.Do you take me for a servant?Maybe they should . Have you ever seen the septa ’ s legs?Jon said, remembering . [BOS] He told me that a maester ’ s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve, I asked why each link was a different metal . A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes, I said . Maester Luwin laughed . A maester forges his chain with study, he told me . The different metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for healing, iron for warcraft . And he said there were other meanings as well . The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves, isn ’ t that so? Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links can ’ t make a chain . You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like . A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people . [EOS] Jon flexed his bandaged fingers to show him . He had burned himself more badly than he knew throwing the flaming drapes, and his right hand was swathed in silk halfway to the elbow . At the time he ’ d felt nothing; the agony had come after . His cracked red skin oozed fluid, and fearsome blood blisters rose between his fingers, big as roaches . [BOS] Healing . The maester says I ’ ll have scars, but otherwise the hand should be as good as it was before . [EOS] Jon remembered the wish he ’ d wished in his anger, the vision of Benjen Stark dead in the snow, and he looked away quickly . The dwarf had a way of sensing things, and Jon did not want him to see the guilt in his eyes . He said he ’ d be back by my name day, he admitted . His name day had come and gone, unremarked, a fortnight past . They were looking for Ser Waymar Royce, his father is bannerman to Lord Arryn . Uncle Benjen said they might search as far as the Shadow Tower . That ’ s all the way up in the mountains.We do, but—You ’ re Ned Stark ’ s bastard, aren ’ t you?Jon heard Grenn suck in his breath, shocked . Silence fell.As he watched his uncle lead his horse into the tunnel, Jon had remembered the things that Tyrion Lannister told him on the kingsroad, and in his mind ’ s eye he saw Ben Stark lying dead, his blood red on the snow . The thought made him sick . What was he becoming? Afterward he sought out Ghost in the loneliness of his cell, and buried his face in his thick white fur.Mormont lifted his eyes from the letter to stare at Jon . There was pity in that look; he could taste it . You heard me.Jon had started drinking then, and he had not stopped.Sam shook his head . No thank you, Jon.Jon said . [BOS] Not if she doesn ’ t know you have it, [EOS] Robb was in the middle of it, shouting commands with the best of them . He seemed to have grown of late, as if Bran ’ s fall and his mother ’ s collapse had somehow made him stronger . Grey Wind was at his side.I want no courtesies either, Mormont said, so thank me no thanks . Honor the steel with deeds, not words.Yes . Cold and hard and mean, that ’ s the Wall, and the men who walk it . Not like the stories your wet nurse told you . Well, piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse . This is the way it is, and you ’ re here for life, same as the rest of us.A striding huntsman had been worked in scarlet thread upon the breast of the fat boy ’ s fur-trimmed surcoat . Jon did not recognize the sigil . Ser Alliser Thorne looked over his new charge and said, It would seem they have run short of poachers and thieves down south . Now they send us pigs to man the Wall . Is fur and velvet your notion of armor, my Lord of Ham?I don ’ t see your wolf, Lannister said as they walked.Ben Jen, the raven squawked, bobbing its head, bits of egg dribbling from its beak . Ben Jen . Ben Jen.There is no shame in being a steward, Sam said.The direwolf trotted to him . Jon heard Samwell Tarly ’ s sharp intake of breath.Leave him where he is, Chett said . The Wall is no place for the weak . Let him train until he is ready, no matter how many years that takes . Ser Alliser shall make a man of him or kill him, as the gods will.The other boys fell silent, taken aback by his sudden fury . Jon said into the quiet, and he told them how it was going to be . Pyp backed him, as he ’ d known he would, but when Halder spoke up, it was a pleasant surprise . Grenn was anxious at the first, but Jon knew the words to move him . One by one the rest fell in line . Jon persuaded some, cajoled some, shamed the others, made threats where threats were required . At the end they had all agreed … all but Rast . [BOS] Listen to me, [EOS] It was soon revealed that the new recruit had brought his own armor with him; padded doublet, boiled leather, mail and plate and helm, even a great wood-and-leather shield blazoned with the same striding huntsman he wore on his surcoat . As none of it was black, however, Ser Alliser insisted that he reequip himself from the armory . That took half the morning . His girth required Donal Noye to take apart a mail hauberk and refit it with leather panels at the sides . To get a helm over his head the armorer had to detach the visor . His leathers bound so tightly around his legs and under his arms that he could scarcely move . Dressed for battle, the new boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst its skin . Let us hope you are not as inept as you look, Ser Alliser said . Halder, see what Ser Piggy can do.Jon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling Grenn to his feet . The frosty morning air felt good on his face . He leaned on his sword, drew a deep breath, and allowed himself a moment to savor the victory.Jon replied . Under his mail and leather, his shoulder was throbbing . He sheathed his sword and tried to remove his helm, but when he raised his arm, the pain made him grit his teeth . [BOS] For an instant, you did, [EOS] Samwell Tarly huddled beneath the trees, half-hidden behind the horses . His round fat face was the color of curdled milk . So far he had not lurched off to the woods to retch, but he had not so much as glanced at the dead men either . I can ’ t look, he whispered miserably.Jon was startled . Sam ’ s nervous, high-pitched voice was the last he would have expected to hear . The fat boy was frightened of the officers, and Ser Jaremy was not known for his patience.The courtyard rang to the song of swords.You don ’ t know what you ’ re asking, Jon . The Night ’ s Watch is a sworn brotherhood . We have no families . None of us will ever father sons . Our wife is duty . Our mistress is honor.Jon was showing Dareon how best to deliver a sidestroke when the new recruit entered the practice yard . Your feet should be farther apart, he urged . You don ’ t want to lose your balance . That ’ s good . Now pivot as you deliver the stroke, get all your weight behind the blade.Jon lifted his sword … and lowered it, helpless . Damn you, he said . Damn you all.He reached the landing and stood for a long moment, afraid . Ghost nuzzled at his hand . He took courage from that . He straightened, and entered the room.Plainly Mormont was not pleased with that answer . Two of our brothers butchered almost within sight of the Wall, yet your rangers heard nothing, saw nothing . Is this what the Night ’ s Watch has fallen to? Do we still sweep these woods?Jon poured with exaggerated care, vaguely aware that he was drawing out the act . When the cups were filled, he would have no choice but to face whatever was in that letter . Yet all too soon, they were filled . Sit, boy, Mormont commanded him . Drink.Grenn scowled . You ’ re uglier than me . At least I don ’ t have ears like a bat.The sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him . They were the last things Jon wanted to hear . He wiped away his tears on the sleeve of his shirt, furious that he had let them fall, and turned to go.The fat boy shuddered . I hate it . He looked as though he was going to cry again.Jon said stubbornly . [BOS] It ’ s better that I ’ m by myself, The rest of them are scared of Ghost . [EOS] Jon messed up her hair . [BOS] I will miss you, little sister . [EOS] Jon wheeled around to face them, drawing his sword . [BOS] Get back . I don ’ t wish to hurt you, but I will if I have to . [EOS] Yet Lord Commander Mormont gave a snort . If Ben Stark had come under Wildling attack a half day ’ s ride from Castle Black, he would have returned for more men, chased the killers through all seven hells and brought me back their heads.You won ’ t . You have to listen to me . Please …He stood in the door for a moment, afraid to speak, afraid to come closer . The window was open . Below, a wolf howled . Ghost heard and lifted his head.Jon turned . Through the eye slit of his helm, he beheld the fattest boy he had ever seen standing in the door of the armory . By the look of him, he must have weighed twenty stone . The fur collar of his embroidered surcoat was lost beneath his chins . Pale eyes moved nervously in a great round moon of a face, and plump sweaty fingers wiped themselves on the velvet of his doublet . [BOS] They … they told me I was to come here for … for training, [EOS] he said to no one in particular.Jon was breaking his fast on applecakes and blood sausage when Samwell Tarly plopped himself down on the bench . I ’ ve been summoned to the sept, Sam said in an excited whisper . They ’ re passing me out of training . I ’ m to be made a brother with the rest of you . Can you believe it?And if I refuse?You have learned the words of the vow . Think carefully before you say them, for once you have taken the black, there is no turning back . The penalty for desertion is death . The Old Bear paused for a moment before he said, Are there any among you who wish to leave our company? If so, go now, and no one shall think the less of you.Craven or not, Samwell Tarly had found the courage to accept his fate like a man . On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns, Benjen Stark had said the last night Jon had seen him alive . You ’ re no ranger, Jon, only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you . He ’ d heard it said that bastards grow up faster than other children; on the Wall, you grew up or you died.Jon, please . You must not do this.Jon twisted like an eel and slammed a heel down across the instep of the boy holding him . There was a sudden cry of pain, and he was free . He flew at Toad, knocked him backward over a bench, and landed on his chest with both hands on his throat, slamming his head against the packed earth.Die! the raven cried.Be that as it may, said Mormont . It is not for me to say . Nor for you.A bully? Jon almost choked on the word . The accusation was so unjust it took his breath away . They were the ones who came after me . Four of them.Ser Alliser ’ s onyx eyes were fixed on Jon Snow . It would seem our Bastard is in love, he said as Jon helped the fat boy to his feet . Show me your steel, Lord Snow.A half dozen of his friends were lurking outside when he left the King ’ s Tower, where Lord Commander Mormont now made his residence . They ’ d hung a target on the granary doors, so they could seem to be honing their skills as archers, but he knew lurkers when he saw them . No sooner did he emerge than Pyp called out, Well, come about, let ’ s have a look.He told them all of it, even the part where he ’ d set Ghost at Rast ’ s throat . Maester Aemon listened silently, blind eyes fixed on the fire, but Chett ’ s face darkened with each word . Jon finished . [BOS] Without us to keep him safe, Sam will have no chance, He ’ s hopeless with a sword . My sister Arya could tear him apart, and she ’ s not yet ten . If Ser Alliser makes him fight, it ’ s only a matter of time before he ’ s hurt or killed . [EOS] Where? I didn ’ t hear anything . The horses stopped.Jon was shocked to see the shine of tears in the old man ’ s eyes . [BOS] Who are you? [EOS] he asked quietly, almost in dread.At evenfall, as the sun sets and we face the gathering night, you shall take your vows . From that moment, you will be a Sworn Brother of the Night ’ s Watch . Your crimes will be washed away, your debts forgiven . So too you must wash away your former loyalties, put aside your grudges, forget old wrongs and old loves alike . Here you begin anew.Jon said . [BOS] These two are Grenn and Pypar, [EOS] I have a place at court, though, the dwarf said, smiling . A word in the right ear, and you ’ ll die a sour old man before you get another boy to train . Now tell Snow why the Old Bear needs to see him . Is there news of his uncle?Crow . Jon thought the raven sounded faintly indignant.Jon hugged him back . [BOS] And you, Stark . Take care of Bran .
