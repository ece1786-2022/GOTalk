There were times—not many <SEP> but a few—when Jon Snow was glad he was a bastard <SEP> As he filled his wine cup once more from a passing flagon <SEP> it struck him that this might be one of them <SEP>
He settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank <SEP> The sweet <SEP> fruity taste of summerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips <SEP>
The Great Hall of Winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted meat and fresh-baked bread <SEP> Its grey stone walls were draped with banners <SEP> White <SEP> gold <SEP> crimson: the direwolf of Stark <SEP> Baratheon ’ s crowned stag <SEP> the lion of Lannister <SEP> A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad <SEP> but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire <SEP> the clangor of pewter plates and cups <SEP> and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations <SEP>
It was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king <SEP> Jon ’ s brothers and sisters had been seated with the royal children <SEP> beneath the raised platform where Lord and Lady Stark hosted the king and queen <SEP> In honor of the occasion <SEP> his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine <SEP> but no more than that <SEP> Down here on the benches <SEP> there was no one to stop Jon drinking as much as he had a thirst for <SEP>
And he was finding that he had a man ’ s thirst <SEP> to the raucous delight of the youths around him <SEP> who urged him on every time he drained a glass <SEP> They were fine company <SEP> and Jon relished the stories they were telling <SEP> tales of battle and bedding and the hunt <SEP> He was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the king ’ s offspring <SEP> He had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their entrance <SEP> The procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench <SEP> and Jon had gotten a good long look at them all <SEP>
His lord father had come first <SEP> escorting the queen <SEP> She was as beautiful as men said <SEP> A jeweled tiara gleamed amidst her long golden hair <SEP> its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes <SEP> His father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat <SEP> but the queen never so much as looked at him <SEP> Even at fourteen <SEP> Jon could see through her smile <SEP>
Next had come King Robert himself <SEP> with Lady Stark on his arm <SEP> The king was a great disappointment to Jon <SEP> His father had talked of him often: the peerless Robert Baratheon <SEP> demon of the Trident <SEP> the fiercest warrior of the realm <SEP> a giant among princes <SEP> Jon saw only a fat man <SEP> red-faced under his beard <SEP> sweating through his silks <SEP> He walked like a man half in his cups <SEP>
After them came the children <SEP> Little Rickon first <SEP> managing the long walk with all the dignity a three-year-old could muster <SEP> Jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit <SEP> Close behind came Robb <SEP> in grey wool trimmed with white <SEP> the Stark colors <SEP> He had the Princess Myrcella on his arm <SEP> She was a wisp of a girl <SEP> not quite eight <SEP> her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net <SEP> Jon noticed the shy looks she gave Robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him <SEP> He decided she was insipid <SEP> Robb didn ’ t even have the sense to realize how stupid she was; he was grinning like a fool <SEP>
His half sisters escorted the royal princes <SEP> Arya was paired with plump young Tommen <SEP> whose white-blond hair was longer than hers <SEP> Sansa <SEP> two years older <SEP> drew the crown prince <SEP> Joffrey Baratheon <SEP> He was twelve <SEP> younger than Jon or Robb <SEP> but taller than either <SEP> to Jon ’ s vast dismay <SEP> Prince Joffrey had his sister ’ s hair and his mother ’ s deep green eyes <SEP> A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past his golden choker and high velvet collar <SEP> Sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him <SEP> but Jon did not like Joffrey ’ s pouty lips or the bored <SEP> disdainful way he looked at Winterfell ’ s Great Hall <SEP>
He was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen ’ s brothers <SEP> the Lannisters of Casterly Rock <SEP> The Lion and the Imp; there was no mistaking which was which <SEP> Ser Jaime Lannister was twin to Queen Cersei; tall and golden <SEP> with flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife <SEP> He wore crimson silk <SEP> high black boots <SEP> a black satin cloak <SEP> On the breast of his tunic <SEP> the lion of his House was embroidered in gold thread <SEP> roaring its defiance <SEP> They called him the Lion of Lannister to his face and whispered  Kingslayer  behind his back <SEP>
Jon found it hard to look away from him <SEP> This is what a king should look like <SEP> he thought to himself as the man passed <SEP>
Then he saw the other one <SEP> waddling along half-hidden by his brother ’ s side <SEP> Tyrion Lannister <SEP> the youngest of Lord Tywin ’ s brood and by far the ugliest <SEP> All that the gods had given to Cersei and Jaime <SEP> they had denied Tyrion <SEP> He was a dwarf <SEP> half his brother ’ s height <SEP> struggling to keep pace on stunted legs <SEP> His head was too large for his body <SEP> with a brute ’ s squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow <SEP> One green eye and one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white <SEP> Jon watched him with fascination <SEP>
The last of the high lords to enter were his uncle <SEP> Benjen Stark of the Night ’ s Watch <SEP> and his father ’ s ward <SEP> young Theon Greyjoy <SEP> Benjen gave Jon a warm smile as he went by <SEP> Theon ignored him utterly <SEP> but there was nothing new in that <SEP> After all had been seated <SEP> toasts were made <SEP> thanks were given and returned <SEP> and then the feasting began <SEP>
Jon had started drinking then <SEP> and he had not stopped <SEP>
Something rubbed against his leg beneath the table <SEP> Jon saw red eyes staring up at him <SEP>  Hungry again?  he asked <SEP> There was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table <SEP> Jon reached out to tear off a leg <SEP> then had a better idea <SEP> He knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his legs <SEP> Ghost ripped into it in savage silence <SEP> His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their wolves to the banquet <SEP> but there were more curs than Jon could count at this end of the hall <SEP> and no one had said a word about his pup <SEP> He told himself he was fortunate in that too <SEP>
His eyes stung <SEP> Jon rubbed at them savagely <SEP> cursing the smoke <SEP> He swallowed another gulp of wine and watched his direwolf devour the chicken <SEP>
Dogs moved between the tables <SEP> trailing after the serving girls <SEP> One of them <SEP> a black mongrel bitch with long yellow eyes <SEP> caught a scent of the chicken <SEP> She stopped and edged under the bench to get a share <SEP> Jon watched the confrontation <SEP> The bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer <SEP> Ghost looked up <SEP> silent <SEP> and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes <SEP> The bitch snapped an angry challenge <SEP> She was three times the size of the direwolf pup <SEP> Ghost did not move <SEP> He stood over his prize and opened his mouth <SEP> baring his fangs <SEP> The bitch tensed <SEP> barked again <SEP> then thought better of this fight <SEP> She turned and slunk away <SEP> with one last defiant snap to save her pride <SEP> Ghost went back to his meal <SEP>
Jon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur <SEP> The direwolf looked up at him <SEP> nipped gently at his hand <SEP> then went back to eating <SEP>
Is this one of the direwolves I ’ ve heard so much of?  a familiar voice asked close at hand <SEP>
Jon looked up happily as his uncle Ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as Jon had ruffled the wolf ’ s <SEP>  Yes <SEP>  he said <SEP>  His name is Ghost <SEP>
One of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he ’ d been telling to make room at the table for their lord ’ s brother <SEP> Benjen Stark straddled the bench with long legs and took the wine cup out of Jon ’ s hand <SEP>  Summerwine <SEP>  he said after a taste <SEP>  Nothing so sweet <SEP> How many cups have you had <SEP> Jon?
Jon smiled <SEP>
Ben Stark laughed <SEP>  As I feared <SEP> Ah <SEP> well <SEP> I believe I was younger than you the first time I got truly and sincerely drunk<SEP>  He snagged a roasted onion <SEP> dripping brown with gravy <SEP> from a nearby trencher and bit into it <SEP> It crunched <SEP>
His uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag <SEP> but there was always a hint of laughter in his blue-grey eyes <SEP> He dressed in black <SEP> as befitted a man of the Night ’ s Watch <SEP> Tonight it was rich black velvet <SEP> with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle <SEP> A heavy silver chain was looped round his neck <SEP> Benjen watched Ghost with amusement as he ate his onion <SEP>  A very quiet wolf <SEP>  he observed <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> <BOS> He ’ s not like the others <SEP> He never makes a sound <SEP> That ’ s why I named him Ghost <SEP> That <SEP> and because he ’ s white <SEP> The others are all dark <SEP> grey or black <SEP> <EOS>
There are still direwolves beyond the Wall <SEP> We hear them on our rangings<SEP>  Benjen Stark gave Jon a long look <SEP>  Don ’ t you usually eat at table with your brothers?
Jon answered in a flat voice <SEP> <BOS> Most times <SEP> But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them <SEP> <EOS>
I see<SEP>  His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall <SEP>  My brother does not seem very festive tonight <SEP>
Jon had noticed that too <SEP> A bastard had to learn to notice things <SEP> to read the truth that people hid behind their eyes <SEP> His father was observing all the courtesies <SEP> but there was tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before <SEP> He said little <SEP> looking out over the hall with hooded eyes <SEP> seeing nothing <SEP> Two seats away <SEP> the king had been drinking heavily all night <SEP> His broad face was flushed behind his great black beard <SEP> He made many a toast <SEP> laughed loudly at every jest <SEP> and attacked each dish like a starving man <SEP> but beside him the queen seemed as cold as an ice sculpture <SEP> Jon told his uncle in a low <SEP> quiet voice <SEP> <BOS> The queen is angry too <SEP> Father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon <SEP> The queen didn ’ t want him to go <SEP> <EOS>
Benjen gave Jon a careful <SEP> measuring look <SEP>  You don ’ t miss much <SEP> do you <SEP> Jon? We could use a man like you on the Wall <SEP>
Jon swelled with pride <SEP> <BOS> Robb is a stronger lance than I am <SEP> but I ’ m the better sword <SEP> and Hullen says I sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle <SEP> <EOS>
Notable achievements <SEP>
Jon said in a sudden rush <SEP> <BOS> Take me with you when you go back to the Wall <SEP> Father will give me leave to go if you ask him <SEP> I know he will <SEP> <EOS>
Uncle Benjen studied his face carefully <SEP>  The Wall is a hard place for a boy <SEP> Jon <SEP>
Jon protested <SEP> <BOS> I am almost a man grown <SEP> I will turn fifteen on my next name day <SEP> and Maester Luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children <SEP> <EOS>
That ’ s true enough <SEP>  Benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth <SEP> He took Jon ’ s cup from the table <SEP> filled it fresh from a nearby pitcher <SEP> and drank down a long swallow <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> The Young Dragon was one of his heroes <SEP> <BOS> Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne <SEP> <EOS>
A conquest that lasted a summer <SEP>  his uncle pointed out <SEP>  Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking the place <SEP> and another fifty trying to hold it <SEP> Someone should have told him that war isn ’ t a game<SEP>  He took another sip of wine <SEP>  Also <SEP>  he said <SEP> wiping his mouth <SEP>  Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when he died <SEP> Or have you forgotten that part?
Jon boasted <SEP> The wine was making him bold <SEP> He tried to sit very straight <SEP> to make himself seem taller <SEP> <BOS> I forget nothing <SEP> I want to serve in the Night ’ s Watch <SEP> Uncle <SEP> <EOS>
He had thought on it long and hard <SEP> lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him <SEP> Robb would someday inherit Winterfell <SEP> would command great armies as the Warden of the North <SEP> Bran and Rickon would be Robb ’ s bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name <SEP> His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own <SEP> But what place could a bastard hope to earn?
You don ’ t know what you ’ re asking <SEP> Jon <SEP> The Night ’ s Watch is a sworn brotherhood <SEP> We have no families <SEP> None of us will ever father sons <SEP> Our wife is duty <SEP> Our mistress is honor <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> <BOS> A bastard can have honor too <SEP> I am ready to swear your oath <SEP> <EOS>
You are a boy of fourteen <SEP>  Benjen said <SEP>  Not a man <SEP> not yet <SEP> Until you have known a woman <SEP> you cannot understand what you would be giving up <SEP>
Jon said hotly <SEP> <BOS> I don ’ t care about that! <EOS>
You might <SEP> if you knew what it meant <SEP>  Benjen said <SEP>  If you knew what the oath would cost you <SEP> you might be less eager to pay the price <SEP> son <SEP>
Jon felt anger rise inside him <SEP> <BOS> I ’ m not your son! <EOS>
Benjen Stark stood up <SEP>  More ’ s the pity<SEP>  He put a hand on Jon ’ s shoulder <SEP>  Come back to me after you ’ ve fathered a few bastards of your own <SEP> and we ’ ll see how you feel <SEP>
Jon trembled <SEP>  I will never father a bastard <SEP>  he said carefully <SEP>  Never!  He spat it out like venom <SEP>
Suddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent <SEP> and they were all looking at him <SEP> He felt the tears begin to well behind his eyes <SEP> He pushed himself to his feet <SEP>
I must be excused <SEP>  he said with the last of his dignity <SEP> He whirled and bolted before they could see him cry <SEP> He must have drunk more wine than he had realized <SEP> His feet got tangled under him as he tried to leave <SEP> and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor <SEP> Laughter boomed all around him <SEP> and Jon felt hot tears on his cheeks <SEP> Someone tried to steady him <SEP> He wrenched free of their grip and ran <SEP> half-blind <SEP> for the door <SEP> Ghost followed close at his heels <SEP> out into the night <SEP>
The yard was quiet and empty <SEP> A lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall <SEP> his cloak pulled tight around him against the cold <SEP> He looked bored and miserable as he huddled there alone <SEP> but Jon would have traded places with him in an instant <SEP> Otherwise the castle was dark and deserted <SEP> Jon had seen an abandoned holdfast once <SEP> a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones kept silent about whatever people had lived there <SEP> Winterfell reminded him of that tonight <SEP>
The sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him <SEP> They were the last things Jon wanted to hear <SEP> He wiped away his tears on the sleeve of his shirt <SEP> furious that he had let them fall <SEP> and turned to go <SEP>
Boy <SEP>  a voice called out to him <SEP> Jon turned <SEP>
Tyrion Lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the Great Hall <SEP> looking for all the world like a gargoyle <SEP> The dwarf grinned down at him <SEP>  Is that animal a wolf?
A direwolf <SEP>  Jon said <SEP>  His name is Ghost<SEP>  He stared up at the little man <SEP> his disappointment suddenly forgotten <SEP>  What are you doing up there? Why aren ’ t you at the feast?
Too hot <SEP> too noisy <SEP> and I ’ d drunk too much wine <SEP>  the dwarf told him <SEP>  I learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother <SEP> Might I have a closer look at your wolf?
Jon hesitated <SEP> then nodded slowly <SEP> <BOS> Can you climb down <SEP> or shall I bring a ladder? <EOS>
Oh <SEP> bleed that <SEP>  the little man said <SEP> He pushed himself off the ledge into empty air <SEP> Jon gasped <SEP> then watched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball <SEP> landed lightly on his hands <SEP> then vaulted backward onto his legs <SEP>
Ghost backed away from him uncertainly <SEP>
The dwarf dusted himself off and laughed <SEP>  I believe I ’ ve frightened your wolf <SEP> My apologies <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> He knelt and called out <SEP> <BOS> He ’ s not scared <SEP> Ghost <SEP> come here <SEP> Come on <SEP> That ’ s it <SEP> <EOS>
The wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon ’ s face <SEP> but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion Lannister <SEP> and when the dwarf reached out to pet him <SEP> he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl <SEP>  Shy <SEP> isn ’ t he?  Lannister observed <SEP>
Sit <SEP> Ghost <SEP>  Jon commanded <SEP>  That ’ s it <SEP> Keep still<SEP>  He looked up at the dwarf <SEP>  You can touch him now <SEP> He won ’ t move until I tell him to <SEP> I ’ ve been training him <SEP>
I see <SEP>  Lannister said <SEP> He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost ’ s ears and said <SEP>  Nice wolf <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> It wasn ’ t actually true yet <SEP> but it would be <SEP> <BOS> If I wasn ’ t here <SEP> he ’ d tear out your throat <SEP> <EOS>
In that case <SEP> you had best stay close <SEP>  the dwarf said <SEP> He cocked his oversized head to one side and looked Jon over with his mismatched eyes <SEP>  I am Tyrion Lannister <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> He rose <SEP> Standing <SEP> he was taller than the dwarf <SEP> It made him feel strange <SEP> <BOS> I know <SEP> <EOS>
You ’ re Ned Stark ’ s bastard <SEP> aren ’ t you?
Jon felt a coldness pass right through him <SEP> He pressed his lips together and said nothing <SEP>
Did I offend you?  Lannister said <SEP>  Sorry <SEP> Dwarfs don ’ t have to be tactful <SEP> Generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head<SEP>  He grinned <SEP>  You are the bastard <SEP> though <SEP>
Jon admitted stiffly <SEP> <BOS> Lord Eddard Stark is my father <SEP> <EOS>
Lannister studied his face <SEP>  Yes <SEP>  he said <SEP>  I can see it <SEP> You have more of the north in you than your brothers <SEP>
Jon corrected <SEP> He was pleased by the dwarf ’ s comment <SEP> but he tried not to let it show <SEP> <BOS> Half brothers <SEP> <EOS>
Let me give you some counsel <SEP> bastard <SEP>  Lannister said <SEP>  Never forget what you are <SEP> for surely the world will not <SEP> Make it your strength <SEP> Then it can never be your weakness <SEP> Armor yourself in it <SEP> and it will never be used to hurt you <SEP>
Jon was in no mood for anyone ’ s counsel <SEP> <BOS> What do you know about being a bastard? <EOS>
All dwarfs are bastards in their father ’ s eyes <SEP>
You are your mother ’ s trueborn son of Lannister <SEP>
Am I?  the dwarf replied <SEP> sardonic <SEP>  Do tell my lord father <SEP> My mother died birthing me <SEP> and he ’ s never been sure <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> <BOS> I don ’ t even know who my mother was <SEP> <EOS>
Some woman <SEP> no doubt <SEP> Most of them are<SEP>  He favored Jon with a rueful grin <SEP>  Remember this <SEP> boy <SEP> All dwarfs may be bastards <SEP> yet not all bastards need be dwarfs<SEP>  And with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast <SEP> whistling a tune <SEP> When he opened the door <SEP> the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard <SEP> and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king <SEP>
Jon climbed the steps slowly <SEP> trying not to think that this might be the last time ever <SEP> Ghost padded silently beside him <SEP> Outside <SEP> snow swirled through the castle gates <SEP> and the yard was all noise and chaos <SEP> but inside the thick stone walls it was still warm and quiet <SEP> Too quiet for Jon ’ s liking <SEP>
He reached the landing and stood for a long moment <SEP> afraid <SEP> Ghost nuzzled at his hand <SEP> He took courage from that <SEP> He straightened <SEP> and entered the room <SEP>
Lady Stark was there beside his bed <SEP> She had been there <SEP> day and night <SEP> for close on a fortnight <SEP> Not for a moment had she left Bran ’ s side <SEP> She had her meals brought to her there <SEP> and chamber pots as well <SEP> and a small hard bed to sleep on <SEP> though it was said she had scarcely slept at all <SEP> She fed him herself <SEP> the honey and water and herb mixture that sustained life <SEP> Not once did she leave the room <SEP> So Jon had stayed away <SEP>
But now there was no more time <SEP>
He stood in the door for a moment <SEP> afraid to speak <SEP> afraid to come closer <SEP> The window was open <SEP> Below <SEP> a wolf howled <SEP> Ghost heard and lifted his head <SEP>
Lady Stark looked over <SEP> For a moment she did not seem to recognize him <SEP> Finally she blinked <SEP>  What are you doing here?  she asked in a voice strangely flat and emotionless <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> <BOS> I came to see Bran <SEP> To say good-bye <SEP> <EOS>
Her face did not change <SEP> Her long auburn hair was dull and tangled <SEP> She looked as though she had aged twenty years <SEP>  You ’ ve said it <SEP> Now go away <SEP>
Part of him wanted only to flee <SEP> but he knew that if he did he might never see Bran again <SEP> He took a nervous step into the room <SEP>  Please <SEP>  he said <SEP>
Something cold moved in her eyes <SEP>  I told you to leave <SEP>  she said <SEP>  We don ’ t want you here <SEP>
Once that would have sent him running <SEP> Once that might even have made him cry <SEP> Now it only made him angry <SEP> He would be a Sworn Brother of the Night ’ s Watch soon <SEP> and face worse dangers than Catelyn Tully Stark <SEP>  He ’ s my brother <SEP>  he said <SEP>
Shall I call the guards?
Jon said <SEP> defiant <SEP> <BOS> Call them <SEP> You can ’ t stop me from seeing him<SEP> <EOS> He crossed the room <SEP> keeping the bed between them <SEP> and looked down on Bran where he lay <SEP>
She was holding one of his hands <SEP> It looked like a claw <SEP> This was not the Bran he remembered <SEP> The flesh had all gone from him <SEP> His skin stretched tight over bones like sticks <SEP> Under the blanket <SEP> his legs bent in ways that made Jon sick <SEP> His eyes were sunken deep into black pits; open <SEP> but they saw nothing <SEP> The fall had shrunken him somehow <SEP> He looked half a leaf <SEP> as if the first strong wind would carry him off to his grave <SEP>
Yet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs <SEP> his chest rose and fell with each shallow breath <SEP>
Bran <SEP>  he said <SEP>  I ’ m sorry I didn ’ t come before <SEP> I was afraid<SEP>  He could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks <SEP> Jon no longer cared <SEP>  Don ’ t die <SEP> Bran <SEP> Please <SEP> We ’ re all waiting for you to wake up <SEP> Me and Robb and the girls <SEP> everyone …
Lady Stark was watching <SEP> She had not raised a cry <SEP> Jon took that for acceptance <SEP> Outside the window <SEP> the direwolf howled again <SEP> The wolf that Bran had not had time to name <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> <BOS> I have to go now <SEP> Uncle Benjen is waiting <SEP> I ’ m to go north to the Wall <SEP> We have to leave today <SEP> before the snows come<SEP> <EOS> He remembered how excited Bran had been at the prospect of the journey <SEP> It was more than he could bear <SEP> the thought of leaving him behind like this <SEP> Jon brushed away his tears <SEP> leaned over <SEP> and kissed his brother lightly on the lips <SEP>
I wanted him to stay here with me <SEP>  Lady Stark said softly <SEP>
Jon watched her <SEP> wary <SEP> She was not even looking at him <SEP> She was talking to him <SEP> but for a part of her <SEP> it was as though he were not even in the room <SEP>
I prayed for it <SEP>  she said dully <SEP>  He was my special boy <SEP> I went to the sept and prayed seven times to the seven faces of god that Ned would change his mind and leave him here with me <SEP> Sometimes prayers are answered <SEP>
Jon did not know what to say <SEP> <BOS> It wasn ’ t your fault <SEP> <EOS> he managed after an awkward silence <SEP>
Her eyes found him <SEP> They were full of poison <SEP>  I need none of your absolution <SEP> bastard <SEP>
Jon lowered his eyes <SEP> She was cradling one of Bran ’ s hands <SEP> He took the other <SEP> squeezed it <SEP> Fingers like the bones of birds <SEP> <BOS> Good-bye <SEP> <EOS> he said <SEP>
He was at the door when she called out to him <SEP>  Jon <SEP>  she said <SEP> He should have kept going <SEP> but she had never called him by his name before <SEP> He turned to find her looking at his face <SEP> as if she were seeing it for the first time <SEP>
Yes?  he said <SEP>
It should have been you <SEP>  she told him <SEP> Then she turned back to Bran and began to weep <SEP> her whole body shaking with the sobs <SEP> Jon had never seen her cry before <SEP>
It was a long walk down to the yard <SEP>
Outside <SEP> everything was noise and confusion <SEP> Wagons were being loaded <SEP> men were shouting <SEP> horses were being harnessed and saddled and led from the stables <SEP> A light snow had begun to fall <SEP> and everyone was in an uproar to be off <SEP>
Robb was in the middle of it <SEP> shouting commands with the best of them <SEP> He seemed to have grown of late <SEP> as if Bran ’ s fall and his mother ’ s collapse had somehow made him stronger <SEP> Grey Wind was at his side <SEP>
Uncle Benjen is looking for you <SEP>  he told Jon <SEP>  He wanted to be gone an hour ago <SEP>
I know <SEP>  Jon said <SEP>  Soon<SEP>  He looked around at all the noise and confusion <SEP>  Leaving is harder than I thought <SEP>
For me too <SEP>  Robb said <SEP> He had snow in his hair <SEP> melting from the heat of his body <SEP>  Did you see him?
Jon nodded <SEP> not trusting himself to speak <SEP>
He ’ s not going to die <SEP>  Robb said <SEP>  I know it <SEP>
Jon agreed <SEP> His voice was flat and tired <SEP> The visit had taken all the strength from him <SEP> <BOS> You Starks are hard to kill <SEP> <EOS>
Robb knew something was wrong <SEP>  My mother …
Jon told him <SEP> <BOS> She was … very kind <SEP> <EOS>
Robb looked relieved <SEP>  Good<SEP>  He smiled <SEP>  The next time I see you <SEP> you ’ ll be all in black <SEP>
Jon forced himself to smile back <SEP> <BOS> It was always my color <SEP> How long do you think it will be? <EOS>
Soon enough <SEP>  Robb promised <SEP> He pulled Jon to him and embraced him fiercely <SEP>  Farewell <SEP> Snow <SEP>
Jon hugged him back <SEP> <BOS> And you <SEP> Stark <SEP> Take care of Bran <SEP> <EOS>
I will<SEP>  They broke apart and looked at each other awkwardly <SEP>  Uncle Benjen said to send you to the stables if I saw you <SEP>  Robb finally said <SEP>
Jon told him <SEP> <BOS> I have one more farewell to make <SEP> <EOS>
Then I haven ’ t seen you <SEP>  Robb replied <SEP> Jon left him standing there in the snow <SEP> surrounded by wagons and wolves and horses <SEP> It was a short walk to the armory <SEP> He picked up his package and took the covered bridge across to the Keep <SEP>
Arya was in her room <SEP> packing a polished ironwood chest that was bigger than she was <SEP> Nymeria was helping <SEP> Arya would only have to point <SEP> and the wolf would bound across the room <SEP> snatch up some wisp of silk in her jaws <SEP> and fetch it back <SEP> But when she smelled Ghost <SEP> she sat down on her haunches and yelped at them <SEP>
Arya glanced behind her <SEP> saw Jon <SEP> and jumped to her feet <SEP> She threw her skinny arms tight around his neck <SEP>  I was afraid you were gone <SEP>  she said <SEP> her breath catching in her throat <SEP>  They wouldn ’ t let me out to say good-bye <SEP>
What did you do now?  Jon was amused <SEP>
Arya disentangled herself from him and made a face <SEP>  Nothing <SEP> I was all packed and everything<SEP>  She gestured at the huge chest <SEP> no more than a third full <SEP> and at the clothes that were scattered all over the room <SEP>  Septa Mordane says I have to do it all over <SEP> My things weren ’ t properly folded <SEP> she says <SEP> A proper southron lady doesn ’ t just throw her clothes inside her chest like old rags <SEP> she says <SEP>
Is that what you did <SEP> little sister?
Well <SEP> they ’ re going to get all messed up anyway <SEP>  she said <SEP>  Who cares how they ’ re folded?
Septa Mordane <SEP>  Jon told her <SEP>  I don ’ t think she ’ d like Nymeria helping <SEP> either<SEP>  The she-wolf regarded him silently with her dark golden eyes <SEP>  It ’ s just as well <SEP> I have something for you to take with you <SEP> and it has to be packed very carefully <SEP>
Her face lit up <SEP>  A present?
You could call it that <SEP> Close the door <SEP>
Wary but excited <SEP> Arya checked the hall <SEP>  Nymeria <SEP> here <SEP> Guard<SEP>  She left the wolf out there to warn of intruders and closed the door <SEP> By then Jon had pulled off the rags he ’ d wrapped it in <SEP> He held it out to her <SEP>
Arya ’ s eyes went wide <SEP> Dark eyes <SEP> like his <SEP>  A sword <SEP>  she said in a small <SEP> hushed breath <SEP>
The scabbard was soft grey leather <SEP> supple as sin <SEP> Jon drew out the blade slowly <SEP> so she could see the deep blue sheen of the steel <SEP>  This is no toy <SEP>  he told her <SEP>  Be careful you don ’ t cut yourself <SEP> The edges are sharp enough to shave with <SEP>
Girls don ’ t shave <SEP>  Arya said <SEP>
Maybe they should <SEP> Have you ever seen the septa ’ s legs?
She giggled at him <SEP>  It ’ s so skinny <SEP>
Jon told her <SEP> <BOS> So are you <SEP> I had Mikken make this special <SEP> The bravos use swords like this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities <SEP> It won ’ t hack a man ’ s head off <SEP> but it can poke him full of holes if you ’ re fast enough <SEP> <EOS>
I can be fast <SEP>  Arya said <SEP>
You ’ ll have to work at it every day<SEP>  He put the sword in her hands <SEP> showed her how to hold it <SEP> and stepped back <SEP>  How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
I think so <SEP>  Arya said <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> <BOS> First lesson <SEP> Stick them with the pointy end <SEP> <EOS>
Arya gave him a whap on the arm with the flat of her blade <SEP> The blow stung <SEP> but Jon found himself grinning like an idiot <SEP>  I know which end to use <SEP>  Arya said <SEP> A doubtful look crossed her face <SEP>  Septa Mordane will take it away from me <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> <BOS> Not if she doesn ’ t know you have it <SEP> <EOS>
Who will I practice with?
Jon promised her <SEP> <BOS> You ’ ll find someone <SEP> King ’ s Landing is a true city <SEP> a thousand times the size of Winterfell <SEP> Until you find a partner <SEP> watch how they fight in the yard <SEP> Run <SEP> and ride <SEP> make yourself strong <SEP> And whatever you do … <EOS>
Arya knew what was coming next <SEP> They said it together <SEP>
… don ’ t … tell … Sansa!
Jon messed up her hair <SEP> <BOS> I will miss you <SEP> little sister <SEP> <EOS>
Suddenly she looked like she was going to cry <SEP>  I wish you were coming with us <SEP>
Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle <SEP> Who knows?  He was feeling better now <SEP> He was not going to let himself be sad <SEP>  I better go <SEP> I ’ ll spend my first year on the Wall emptying chamber pots if I keep Uncle Ben waiting any longer <SEP>
Arya ran to him for a last hug <SEP> Jon warned her <SEP> laughing <SEP> She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses <SEP> <BOS> Put down the sword first <SEP> <EOS>
When he turned back at the door <SEP> she was holding it again <SEP> trying it for balance <SEP>  I almost forgot <SEP>  he told her <SEP>  All the best swords have names <SEP>
Like Ice <SEP>  she said <SEP> She looked at the blade in her hand <SEP>  Does this have a name? Oh <SEP> tell me <SEP>
Jon teased <SEP> <BOS> Can ’ t you guess? Your very favorite thing <SEP> <EOS>
Arya seemed puzzled at first <SEP> Then it came to her <SEP> She was that quick <SEP> They said it together:
Needle!
The memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north <SEP>
DAENERYS
Daenerys Targaryen wed Khal Drogo with fear and barbaric splendor in a field beyond the walls of Pentos <SEP> for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man ’ s life must be done beneath the open sky <SEP>
Drogo had called his khalasar to attend him and they had come <SEP> forty thousand Dothraki warriors and uncounted numbers of women <SEP> children <SEP> and slaves <SEP> Outside the city walls they camped with their vast herds <SEP> raising palaces of woven grass <SEP> eating everything in sight <SEP> and making the good folk of Pentos more anxious with every passing day <SEP>
My fellow magisters have doubled the size of the city guard <SEP>  Illyrio told them over platters of honey duck and orange snap peppers one night at the manse that had been Drogo ’ s <SEP> The khal had joined his khalasar <SEP> his estate given over to Daenerys and her brother until the wedding <SEP>
Best we get Princess Daenerys wedded quickly before they hand half the wealth of Pentos away to sellswords and bravos <SEP>  Ser Jorah Mormont jested <SEP> The exile had offered her brother his sword the night Dany had been sold to Khal Drogo; Viserys had accepted eagerly <SEP> Mormont had been their constant companion ever since <SEP>
Magister Illyrio laughed lightly through his forked beard <SEP> but Viserys did not so much as smile <SEP>  He can have her tomorrow <SEP> if he likes <SEP>  her brother said <SEP> He glanced over at Dany <SEP> and she lowered her eyes <SEP>  So long as he pays the price <SEP>
Illyrio waved a languid hand in the air <SEP> rings glittering on his fat fingers <SEP>  I have told you <SEP> all is settled <SEP> Trust me <SEP> The khal has promised you a crown <SEP> and you shall have it <SEP>
Yes <SEP> but when?
When the khal chooses <SEP>  Illyrio said <SEP>  He will have the girl first <SEP> and after they are wed he must make his procession across the plains and present her to the dosh khaleen at Vaes Dothrak <SEP> After that <SEP> perhaps <SEP> If the omens favor war <SEP>
Viserys seethed with impatience <SEP>  I piss on Dothraki omens <SEP> The Usurper sits on my father ’ s throne <SEP> How long must I wait?
Illyrio gave a massive shrug <SEP>  You have waited most of your life <SEP> great king <SEP> What is another few months <SEP> another few years?
Ser Jorah <SEP> who had traveled as far east as Vaes Dothrak <SEP> nodded in agreement <SEP>  I counsel you to be patient <SEP> Your Grace <SEP> The Dothraki are true to their word <SEP> but they do things in their own time <SEP> A lesser man may beg a favor from the khal <SEP> but must never presume to berate him <SEP>
Viserys bristled <SEP>  Guard your tongue <SEP> Mormont <SEP> or I ’ ll have it out <SEP> I am no lesser man <SEP> I am the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms <SEP> The dragon does not beg <SEP>
Ser Jorah lowered his eyes respectfully <SEP> Illyrio smiled enigmatically and tore a wing from the duck <SEP> Honey and grease ran over his fingers and dripped down into his beard as he nibbled at the tender meat <SEP> There are no more dragons <SEP> Dany thought <SEP> staring at her brother <SEP> though she did not dare say it aloud <SEP>
Yet that night she dreamt of one <SEP> Viserys was hitting her <SEP> hurting her <SEP> She was naked <SEP> clumsy with fear <SEP> She ran from him <SEP> but her body seemed thick and ungainly <SEP> He struck her again <SEP> She stumbled and fell <SEP>  You woke the dragon <SEP>  he screamed as he kicked her <SEP>  You woke the dragon <SEP> you woke the dragon<SEP>  Her thighs were slick with blood <SEP> She closed her eyes and whimpered <SEP> As if in answer <SEP> there was a hideous ripping sound and the crackling of some great fire <SEP> When she looked again <SEP> Viserys was gone <SEP> great columns of flame rose all around <SEP> and in the midst of them was the dragon <SEP> It turned its great head slowly <SEP> When its molten eyes found hers <SEP> she woke <SEP> shaking and covered with a fine sheen of sweat <SEP> She had never been so afraid …
… until the day of her wedding came at last <SEP>
The ceremony began at dawn and continued until dusk <SEP> an endless day of drinking and feasting and fighting <SEP> A mighty earthen ramp had been raised amid the grass palaces <SEP> and there Dany was seated beside Khal Drogo <SEP> above the seething sea of Dothraki <SEP> She had never seen so many people in one place <SEP> nor people so strange and frightening <SEP> The horselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when they visited the Free Cities <SEP> but out under the open sky they kept the old ways <SEP> Men and women alike wore painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze medallion belts <SEP> and the warriors greased their long braids with fat from the rendering pits <SEP> They gorged themselves on horseflesh roasted with honey and peppers <SEP> drank themselves blind on fermented mare ’ s milk and Illyrio ’ s fine wines <SEP> and spat jests at each other across the fires <SEP> their voices harsh and alien in Dany ’ s ears <SEP>
Viserys was seated just below her <SEP> splendid in a new black wool tunic with a scarlet dragon on the chest <SEP> Illyrio and Ser Jorah sat beside him <SEP> Theirs was a place of high honor <SEP> just below the khal ’ s own bloodriders <SEP> but Dany could see the anger in her brother ’ s lilac eyes <SEP> He did not like sitting beneath her <SEP> and he fumed when the slaves offered each dish first to the khal and his bride <SEP> and served him from the portions they refused <SEP> He could do nothing but nurse his resentment <SEP> so nurse it he did <SEP> his mood growing blacker by the hour at each insult to his person <SEP>
Dany had never felt so alone as she did seated in the midst of that vast horde <SEP> Her brother had told her to smile <SEP> and so she smiled until her face ached and the tears came unbidden to her eyes <SEP> She did her best to hide them <SEP> knowing how angry Viserys would be if he saw her crying <SEP> terrified of how Khal Drogo might react <SEP> Food was brought to her <SEP> steaming joints of meat and thick black sausages and Dothraki blood pies <SEP> and later fruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from the kitchens of Pentos <SEP> but she waved it all away <SEP> Her stomach was a roil <SEP> and she knew she could keep none of it down <SEP>
There was no one to talk to <SEP> Khal Drogo shouted commands and jests down to his bloodriders <SEP> and laughed at their replies <SEP> but he scarcely glanced at Dany beside him <SEP> They had no common language <SEP> Dothraki was incomprehensible to her <SEP> and the khal knew only a few words of the bastard Valyrian of the Free Cities <SEP> and none at all of the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms <SEP> She would even have welcomed the conversation of Illyrio and her brother <SEP> but they were too far below to hear her <SEP>
So she sat in her wedding silks <SEP> nursing a cup of honeyed wine <SEP> afraid to eat <SEP> talking silently to herself <SEP> I am blood of the dragon <SEP> she told herself <SEP> I am Daenerys Stormborn <SEP> Princess of Dragonstone <SEP> of the blood and seed of Aegon the Conqueror <SEP>
The sun was only a quarter of the way up the sky when she saw her first man die <SEP> Drums were beating as some of the women danced for the khal <SEP> Drogo watched without expression <SEP> but his eyes followed their movements <SEP> and from time to time he would toss down a bronze medallion for the women to fight over <SEP>
The warriors were watching too <SEP> One of them finally stepped into the circle <SEP> grabbed a dancer by the arm <SEP> pushed her down to the ground <SEP> and mounted her right there <SEP> as a stallion mounts a mare <SEP> Illyrio had told her that might happen <SEP>  The Dothraki mate like the animals in their herds <SEP> There is no privacy in a khalasar <SEP> and they do not understand sin or shame as we do <SEP>
Dany looked away from the coupling <SEP> frightened when she realized what was happening <SEP> but a second warrior stepped forward <SEP> and a third <SEP> and soon there was no way to avert her eyes <SEP> Then two men seized the same woman <SEP> She heard a shout <SEP> saw a shove <SEP> and in the blink of an eye the arakhs were out <SEP> long razor-sharp blades <SEP> half sword and half scythe <SEP> A dance of death began as the warriors circled and slashed <SEP> leaping toward each other <SEP> whirling the blades around their heads <SEP> shrieking insults at each clash <SEP> No one made a move to interfere <SEP>
It ended as quickly as it began <SEP> The arakhs shivered together faster than Dany could follow <SEP> one man missed a step <SEP> the other swung his blade in a flat arc <SEP> Steel bit into flesh just above the Dothraki ’ s waist <SEP> and opened him from backbone to belly button <SEP> spilling his entrails into the dust <SEP> As the loser died <SEP> the winner took hold of the nearest woman—not even the one they had been quarreling over—and had her there and then <SEP> Slaves carried off the body <SEP> and the dancing resumed <SEP>
Magister Illyrio had warned Dany about this too <SEP>  A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair <SEP>  he had said <SEP> Her wedding must have been especially blessed; before the day was over <SEP> a dozen men had died <SEP>
As the hours passed <SEP> the terror grew in Dany <SEP> until it was all she could do not to scream <SEP> She was afraid of the Dothraki <SEP> whose ways seemed alien and monstrous <SEP> as if they were beasts in human skins and not true men at all <SEP> She was afraid of her brother <SEP> of what he might do if she failed him <SEP> Most of all <SEP> she was afraid of what would happen tonight under the stars <SEP> when her brother gave her up to the hulking giant who sat drinking beside her with a face as still and cruel as a bronze mask <SEP>
I am the blood of the dragon <SEP> she told herself again <SEP>
When at last the sun was low in the sky <SEP> Khal Drogo clapped his hands together <SEP> and the drums and the shouting and feasting came to a sudden halt <SEP> Drogo stood and pulled Dany to her feet beside him <SEP> It was time for her bride gifts <SEP>
And after the gifts <SEP> she knew <SEP> after the sun had gone down <SEP> it would be time for the first ride and the consummation of her marriage <SEP> Dany tried to put the thought aside <SEP> but it would not leave her <SEP> She hugged herself to try to keep from shaking <SEP>
Her brother Viserys gifted her with three handmaids <SEP> Dany knew they had cost him nothing; Illyrio no doubt had provided the girls <SEP> Irri and Jhiqui were copper-skinned Dothraki with black hair and almond-shaped eyes <SEP> Doreah a fair-haired <SEP> blue-eyed Lysene girl <SEP>  These are no common servants <SEP> sweet sister <SEP>  her brother told her as they were brought forward one by one <SEP>  Illyrio and I selected them personally for you <SEP> Irri will teach you riding <SEP> Jhiqui the Dothraki tongue <SEP> and Doreah will instruct you in the womanly arts of love<SEP>  He smiled thinly <SEP>  She ’ s very good <SEP> Illyrio and I can both swear to that <SEP>
Ser Jorah Mormont apologized for his gift <SEP>  It is a small thing <SEP> my princess <SEP> but all a poor exile could afford <SEP>  he said as he laid a small stack of old books before her <SEP> They were histories and songs of the Seven Kingdoms <SEP> she saw <SEP> written in the Common Tongue <SEP> She thanked him with all her heart <SEP>
Magister Illyrio murmured a command <SEP> and four burly slaves hurried forward <SEP> bearing between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze <SEP> When she opened it <SEP> she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the Free Cities could produce … and resting on top <SEP> nestled in the soft cloth <SEP> three huge eggs <SEP> Dany gasped <SEP> They were the most beautiful things she had ever seen <SEP> each different than the others <SEP> patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels <SEP> and so large it took both of her hands to hold one <SEP> She lifted it delicately <SEP> expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel <SEP> or even blown glass <SEP> but it was much heavier than that <SEP> as if it were all of solid stone <SEP> The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales <SEP> and as she turned the egg between her fingers <SEP> they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun <SEP> One egg was a deep green <SEP> with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how Dany turned it <SEP> Another was pale cream streaked with gold <SEP> The last was black <SEP> as black as a midnight sea <SEP> yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls <SEP>  What are they?  she asked <SEP> her voice hushed and full of wonder <SEP>
Dragon ’ s eggs <SEP> from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai <SEP>  said Magister Illyrio <SEP>  The eons have turned them to stone <SEP> yet still they burn bright with beauty <SEP>
I shall treasure them always<SEP>  Dany had heard tales of such eggs <SEP> but she had never seen one <SEP> nor thought to see one <SEP> It was a truly magnificent gift <SEP> though she knew that Illyrio could afford to be lavish <SEP> He had collected a fortune in horses and slaves for his part in selling her to Khal Drogo <SEP>
The khal ’ s bloodriders offered her the traditional three weapons <SEP> and splendid weapons they were <SEP> Haggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle <SEP> Cohollo a magnificent arakh chased in gold <SEP> and Qotho a double-curved dragonbone bow taller than she was <SEP> Magister Illyrio and Ser Jorah had taught her the traditional refusals for these offerings <SEP>  This is a gift worthy of a great warrior <SEP> O blood of my blood <SEP> and I am but a woman <SEP> Let my lord husband bear these in my stead<SEP>  And so Khal Drogo too received his  bride gifts <SEP>
Other gifts she was given in plenty by other Dothraki: slippers and jewels and silver rings for her hair <SEP> medallion belts and painted vests and soft furs <SEP> sandsilks and jars of scent <SEP> needles and feathers and tiny bottles of purple glass <SEP> and a gown made from the skin of a thousand mice <SEP>  A handsome gift <SEP> Khaleesi <SEP>  Magister Illyrio said of the last <SEP> after he had told her what it was <SEP>  Most lucky<SEP>  The gifts mounted up around her in great piles <SEP> more gifts than she could possibly imagine <SEP> more gifts than she could want or use <SEP>
And last of all <SEP> Khal Drogo brought forth his own bride gift to her <SEP> An expectant hush rippled out from the center of the camp as he left her side <SEP> growing until it had swallowed the whole khalasar <SEP> When he returned <SEP> the dense press of Dothraki gift-givers parted before him <SEP> and he led the horse to her <SEP>
She was a young filly <SEP> spirited and splendid <SEP> Dany knew just enough about horses to know that this was no ordinary animal <SEP> There was something about her that took the breath away <SEP> She was grey as the winter sea <SEP> with a mane like silver smoke <SEP>
Hesitantly she reached out and stroked the horse ’ s neck <SEP> ran her fingers through the silver of her mane <SEP> Khal Drogo said something in Dothraki and Magister Illyrio translated <SEP>  Silver for the silver of your hair <SEP> the khal says <SEP>
She ’ s beautiful <SEP>  Dany murmured <SEP>
She is the pride of the khalasar <SEP>  Illyrio said <SEP>  Custom decrees that the khaleesi must ride a mount worthy of her place by the side of the khal <SEP>
Drogo stepped forward and put his hands on her waist <SEP> He lifted her up as easily as if she were a child and set her on the thin Dothraki saddle <SEP> so much smaller than the ones she was used to <SEP> Dany sat there uncertain for a moment <SEP> No one had told her about this part <SEP>  What should I do?  she asked Illyrio <SEP>
It was Ser Jorah Mormont who answered <SEP>  Take the reins and ride <SEP> You need not go far <SEP>
Nervously Dany gathered the reins in her hands and slid her feet into the short stirrups <SEP> She was only a fair rider; she had spent far more time traveling by ship and wagon and palanquin than by horseback <SEP> Praying that she would not fall off and disgrace herself <SEP> she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch with her knees <SEP>
And for the first time in hours <SEP> she forgot to be afraid <SEP> Or perhaps it was for the first time ever <SEP>
The silver-grey filly moved with a smooth and silken gait <SEP> and the crowd parted for her <SEP> every eye upon them <SEP> Dany found herself moving faster than she had intended <SEP> yet somehow it was exciting rather than terrifying <SEP> The horse broke into a trot <SEP> and she smiled <SEP> Dothraki scrambled to clear a path <SEP> The slightest pressure with her legs <SEP> the lightest touch on the reins <SEP> and the filly responded <SEP> She sent it into a gallop <SEP> and now the Dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at her as they jumped out of her way <SEP> As she turned to ride back <SEP> a firepit loomed ahead <SEP> directly in her path <SEP> They were hemmed in on either side <SEP> with no room to stop <SEP> A daring she had never known filled Daenerys then <SEP> and she gave the filly her head <SEP>
The silver horse leapt the flames as if she had wings <SEP>
When she pulled up before Magister Illyrio <SEP> she said <SEP>  Tell Khal Drogo that he has given me the wind<SEP>  The fat Pentoshi stroked his yellow beard as he repeated her words in Dothraki <SEP> and Dany saw her new husband smile for the first time <SEP>
The last sliver of sun vanished behind the high walls of Pentos to the west just then <SEP> Dany had lost all track of time <SEP> Khal Drogo commanded his bloodriders to bring forth his own horse <SEP> a lean red stallion <SEP> As the khal was saddling the horse <SEP> Viserys slid close to Dany on her silver <SEP> dug his fingers into her leg <SEP> and said <SEP>  Please him <SEP> sweet sister <SEP> or I swear <SEP> you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken before <SEP>
The fear came back to her then <SEP> with her brother ’ s words <SEP> She felt like a child once more <SEP> only thirteen and all alone <SEP> not ready for what was about to happen to her <SEP>
They rode out together as the stars came out <SEP> leaving the khalasar and the grass palaces behind <SEP> Khal Drogo spoke no word to her <SEP> but drove his stallion at a hard trot through the gathering dusk <SEP> The tiny silver bells in his long braid rang softly as he rode <SEP>  I am the blood of the dragon <SEP>  she whispered aloud as she followed <SEP> trying to keep her courage up <SEP>  I am the blood of the dragon <SEP> I am the blood of the dragon<SEP>  The dragon was never afraid <SEP>
Afterward she could not say how far or how long they had ridden <SEP> but it was full dark when they stopped at a grassy place beside a small stream <SEP> Drogo swung off his horse and lifted her down from hers <SEP> She felt as fragile as glass in his hands <SEP> her limbs as weak as water <SEP> She stood there helpless and trembling in her wedding silks while he secured the horses <SEP> and when he turned to look at her <SEP> she began to cry <SEP>
Khal Drogo stared at her tears <SEP> his face strangely empty of expression <SEP>  No <SEP>  he said <SEP> He lifted his hand and rubbed away the tears roughly with a callused thumb <SEP>
You speak the Common Tongue <SEP>  Dany said in wonder <SEP>
No <SEP>  he said again <SEP>
Perhaps he had only that word <SEP> she thought <SEP> but it was one word more than she had known he had <SEP> and somehow it made her feel a little better <SEP> Drogo touched her hair lightly <SEP> sliding the silver-blond strands between his fingers and murmuring softly in Dothraki <SEP> Dany did not understand the words <SEP> yet there was warmth in the tone <SEP> a tenderness she had never expected from this man <SEP>
He put his finger under her chin and lifted her head <SEP> so she was looking up into his eyes <SEP> Drogo towered over her as he towered over everyone <SEP> Taking her lightly under the arms <SEP> he lifted her and seated her on a rounded rock beside the stream <SEP> Then he sat on the ground facing her <SEP> legs crossed beneath him <SEP> their faces finally at a height <SEP>  No <SEP>  he said <SEP>
Is that the only word you know?  she asked him <SEP>
Drogo did not reply <SEP> His long heavy braid was coiled in the dirt beside him <SEP> He pulled it over his right shoulder and began to remove the bells from his hair <SEP> one by one <SEP> After a moment Dany leaned forward to help <SEP> When they were done <SEP> Drogo gestured <SEP> She understood <SEP> Slowly <SEP> carefully <SEP> she began to undo his braid <SEP>
It took a long time <SEP> All the while he sat there silently <SEP> watching her <SEP> When she was done <SEP> he shook his head <SEP> and his hair spread out behind him like a river of darkness <SEP> oiled and gleaming <SEP> She had never seen hair so long <SEP> so black <SEP> so thick <SEP>
Then it was his turn <SEP> He began to undress her <SEP>
His fingers were deft and strangely tender <SEP> He removed her silks one by one <SEP> carefully <SEP> while Dany sat unmoving <SEP> silent <SEP> looking at his eyes <SEP> When he bared her small breasts <SEP> she could not help herself <SEP> She averted her eyes and covered herself with her hands <SEP>  No <SEP>  Drogo said <SEP> He pulled her hands away from her breasts <SEP> gently but firmly <SEP> then lifted her face again to make her look at him <SEP>  No <SEP>  he repeated <SEP>
No <SEP>  she echoed back at him <SEP>
He stood her up then and pulled her close to remove the last of her silks <SEP> The night air was chilly on her bare skin <SEP> She shivered <SEP> and gooseflesh covered her arms and legs <SEP> She was afraid of what would come next <SEP> but for a while nothing happened <SEP> Khal Drogo sat with his legs crossed <SEP> looking at her <SEP> drinking in her body with his eyes <SEP>
After a while he began to touch her <SEP> Lightly at first <SEP> then harder <SEP> She could sense the fierce strength in his hands <SEP> but he never hurt her <SEP> He held her hand in his own and brushed her fingers <SEP> one by one <SEP> He ran a hand gently down her leg <SEP> He stroked her face <SEP> tracing the curve of her ears <SEP> running a finger gently around her mouth <SEP> He put both hands in her hair and combed it with his fingers <SEP> He turned her around <SEP> massaged her shoulders <SEP> slid a knuckle down the path of her spine <SEP>
It seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts <SEP> He stroked the soft skin underneath until it tingled <SEP> He circled her nipples with his thumbs <SEP> pinched them between thumb and forefinger <SEP> then began to pull at her <SEP> very lightly at first <SEP> then more insistently <SEP> until her nipples stiffened and began to ache <SEP>
He stopped then <SEP> and drew her down onto his lap <SEP> Dany was flushed and breathless <SEP> her heart fluttering in her chest <SEP> He cupped her face in his huge hands and she looked into his eyes <SEP>  No?  he said <SEP> and she knew it was a question <SEP>
She took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs <SEP>  Yes <SEP>  she whispered as she put his finger inside her <SEP>
The courtyard rang to the song of swords <SEP>
Under black wool <SEP> boiled leather <SEP> and mail <SEP> sweat trickled icily down Jon ’ s chest as he pressed the attack <SEP> Grenn stumbled backward <SEP> defending himself clumsily <SEP> When he raised his sword <SEP> Jon went underneath it with a sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boy ’ s leg and sent him staggering <SEP> Grenn ’ s downcut was answered by an overhand that dented his helm <SEP> When he tried a sideswing <SEP> Jon swept aside his blade and slammed a mailed forearm into his chest <SEP> Grenn lost his footing and sat down hard in the snow <SEP> Jon knocked his sword from his fingers with a slash to his wrist that brought a cry of pain <SEP>
Enough!  Ser Alliser Thorne had a voice with an edge like Valyrian steel <SEP>
Grenn cradled his hand <SEP>  The bastard broke my wrist <SEP>
The bastard hamstrung you <SEP> opened your empty skull <SEP> and cut off your hand <SEP> Or would have <SEP> if these blades had an edge <SEP> It ’ s fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers<SEP>  Ser Alliser gestured at Jeren and Toad <SEP>  Get the Aurochs on his feet <SEP> he has funeral arrangements to make <SEP>
Jon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling Grenn to his feet <SEP> The frosty morning air felt good on his face <SEP> He leaned on his sword <SEP> drew a deep breath <SEP> and allowed himself a moment to savor the victory <SEP>
That is a longsword <SEP> not an old man ’ s cane <SEP>  Ser Alliser said sharply <SEP>  Are your legs hurting <SEP> Lord Snow?
Jon hated that name <SEP> a mockery that Ser Alliser had hung on him the first day he came to practice <SEP> The boys had picked it up <SEP> and now he heard it everywhere <SEP> He slid the longsword back into its scabbard <SEP> <BOS> No <SEP> <EOS> he replied <SEP>
Thorne strode toward him <SEP> crisp black leathers whispering faintly as he moved <SEP> He was a compact man of fifty years <SEP> spare and hard <SEP> with grey in his black hair and eyes like chips of onyx <SEP>  The truth now <SEP>  he commanded <SEP>
Jon admitted <SEP> His arm burned from the weight of the longsword <SEP> and he was starting to feel his bruises now that the fight was done <SEP> <BOS> I ’ m tired <SEP> <EOS>
What you are is weak <SEP>
I won <SEP>
No <SEP> The Aurochs lost <SEP>
One of the other boys sniggered <SEP> Jon knew better than to reply <SEP> He had beaten everyone that Ser Alliser had sent against him <SEP> yet it gained him nothing <SEP> The master-at-arms served up only derision <SEP> Thorne hated him <SEP> Jon had decided; of course <SEP> he hated the other boys even worse <SEP>
That will be all <SEP>  Thorne told them <SEP>  I can only stomach so much ineptitude in any one day <SEP> If the Others ever come for us <SEP> I pray they have archers <SEP> because you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder <SEP>
Jon followed the rest back to the armory <SEP> walking alone <SEP> He often walked alone here <SEP> There were almost twenty in the group he trained with <SEP> yet not one he could call a friend <SEP> Most were two or three years his senior <SEP> yet not one was half the fighter Robb had been at fourteen <SEP> Dareon was quick but afraid of being hit <SEP> Pyp used his sword like a dagger <SEP> Jeren was weak as a girl <SEP> Grenn slow and clumsy <SEP> Halder ’ s blows were brutally hard but he ran right into your attacks <SEP> The more time he spent with them <SEP> the more Jon despised them <SEP>
Inside <SEP> Jon hung sword and scabbard from a hook in the stone wall <SEP> ignoring the others around him <SEP> Methodically <SEP> he began to strip off his mail <SEP> leather <SEP> and sweat-soaked woolens <SEP> Chunks of coal burned in iron braziers at either end of the long room <SEP> but Jon found himself shivering <SEP> The chill was always with him here <SEP> In a few years he would forget what it felt like to be warm <SEP>
The weariness came on him suddenly <SEP> as he donned the roughspun blacks that were their everyday wear <SEP> He sat on a bench <SEP> his fingers fumbling with the fastenings on his cloak <SEP> So cold <SEP> he thought <SEP> remembering the warm halls of Winterfell <SEP> where the hot waters ran through the walls like blood through a man ’ s body <SEP> There was scant warmth to be found in Castle Black; the walls were cold here <SEP> and the people colder <SEP>
No one had told him the Night ’ s Watch would be like this; no one except Tyrion Lannister <SEP> The dwarf had given him the truth on the road north <SEP> but by then it had been too late <SEP> Jon wondered if his father had known what the Wall would be like <SEP> He must have <SEP> he thought; that only made it hurt the worse <SEP>
Even his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world <SEP> Up here <SEP> the genial Benjen Stark he had known became a different person <SEP> He was First Ranger <SEP> and he spent his days and nights with Lord Commander Mormont and Maester Aemon and the other high officers <SEP> while Jon was given over to the less than tender charge of Ser Alliser Thorne <SEP>
Three days after their arrival <SEP> Jon had heard that Benjen Stark was to lead a half-dozen men on a ranging into the haunted forest <SEP> That night he sought out his uncle in the great timbered common hall and pleaded to go with him <SEP> Benjen refused him curtly <SEP>  This is not Winterfell <SEP>  he told him as he cut his meat with fork and dagger <SEP>  On the Wall <SEP> a man gets only what he earns <SEP> You ’ re no ranger <SEP> Jon <SEP> only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you <SEP>
Stupidly <SEP> Jon argued <SEP>  I ’ ll be fifteen on my name day <SEP>  he said <SEP>  Almost a man grown <SEP>
Benjen Stark frowned <SEP>  A boy you are <SEP> and a boy you ’ ll remain until Ser Alliser says you are fit to be a man of the Night ’ s Watch <SEP> If you thought your Stark blood would win you easy favors <SEP> you were wrong <SEP> We put aside our old families when we swear our vows <SEP> Your father will always have a place in my heart <SEP> but these are my brothers now<SEP>  He gestured with his dagger at the men around them <SEP> all the hard cold men in black <SEP>
Jon rose at dawn the next day to watch his uncle leave <SEP> One of his rangers <SEP> a big ugly man <SEP> sang a bawdy song as he saddled his garron <SEP> his breath steaming in the cold morning air <SEP> Ben Stark smiled at that <SEP> but he had no smile for his nephew <SEP> <BOS> How often must I tell you no <SEP> Jon? We ’ ll speak when I return <SEP> <EOS>
As he watched his uncle lead his horse into the tunnel <SEP> Jon had remembered the things that Tyrion Lannister told him on the kingsroad <SEP> and in his mind ’ s eye he saw Ben Stark lying dead <SEP> his blood red on the snow <SEP> The thought made him sick <SEP> What was he becoming? Afterward he sought out Ghost in the loneliness of his cell <SEP> and buried his face in his thick white fur <SEP>
If he must be alone <SEP> he would make solitude his armor <SEP> Castle Black had no godswood <SEP> only a small sept and a drunken septon <SEP> but Jon could not find it in him to pray to any gods <SEP> old or new <SEP> If they were real <SEP> he thought <SEP> they were as cruel and implacable as winter <SEP>
He missed his true brothers: little Rickon <SEP> bright eyes shining as he begged for a sweet; Robb <SEP> his rival and best friend and constant companion; Bran <SEP> stubborn and curious <SEP> always wanting to follow and join in whatever Jon and Robb were doing <SEP> He missed the girls too <SEP> even Sansa <SEP> who never called him anything but  my half brother  since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant <SEP> And Arya … he missed her even more than Robb <SEP> skinny little thing that she was <SEP> all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes <SEP> so fierce and willful <SEP> Arya never seemed to fit <SEP> no more than he had … yet she could always make Jon smile <SEP> He would give anything to be with her now <SEP> to muss up her hair once more and watch her make a face <SEP> to hear her finish a sentence with him <SEP>
You broke my wrist <SEP> bastard boy <SEP>
Jon lifted his eyes at the sullen voice <SEP> Grenn loomed over him <SEP> thick of neck and red of face <SEP> with three of his friends behind him <SEP> He knew Todder <SEP> a short ugly boy with an unpleasant voice <SEP> The recruits all called him Toad <SEP> The other two were the ones Yoren had brought north with them <SEP> Jon remembered <SEP> rapers taken down in the Fingers <SEP> He ’ d forgotten their names <SEP> He hardly ever spoke to them <SEP> if he could help it <SEP> They were brutes and bullies <SEP> without a thimble of honor between them <SEP>
Jon stood up <SEP> <BOS> I ’ ll break the other one for you if you ask nicely<SEP> <EOS> Grenn was sixteen and a head taller than Jon <SEP> All four of them were bigger than he was <SEP> but they did not scare him <SEP> He ’ d beaten every one of them in the yard <SEP>
Maybe we ’ ll break you <SEP>  one of the rapers said <SEP>
Jon reached back for his sword <SEP> but one of them grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back <SEP> <BOS> Try<SEP> <EOS>
You make us look bad <SEP>  complained Toad <SEP>
Jon told him <SEP> The boy who had his arm jerked upward on him <SEP> hard <SEP> Pain lanced through him <SEP> but Jon would not cry out <SEP> <BOS> You looked bad before I ever met you <SEP> <EOS>
Toad stepped close <SEP>  The little lordling has a mouth on him <SEP>  he said <SEP> He had pig eyes <SEP> small and shiny <SEP>  Is that your mommy ’ s mouth <SEP> bastard? What was she <SEP> some whore? Tell us her name <SEP> Maybe I had her a time or two<SEP>  He laughed <SEP>
Jon twisted like an eel and slammed a heel down across the instep of the boy holding him <SEP> There was a sudden cry of pain <SEP> and he was free <SEP> He flew at Toad <SEP> knocked him backward over a bench <SEP> and landed on his chest with both hands on his throat <SEP> slamming his head against the packed earth <SEP>
The two from the Fingers pulled him off <SEP> throwing him roughly to the ground <SEP> Grenn began to kick at him <SEP> Jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming voice cut through the gloom of the armory <SEP>  STOP THIS! NOW!
Jon pulled himself to his feet <SEP> Donal Noye stood glowering at them <SEP>  The yard is for fighting <SEP>  the armorer said <SEP>  Keep your quarrels out of my armory <SEP> or I ’ ll make them my quarrels <SEP> You won ’ t like that <SEP>
Toad sat on the floor <SEP> gingerly feeling the back of his head <SEP> His fingers came away bloody <SEP>  He tried to kill me <SEP>
’ S true <SEP> I saw it <SEP>  one of the rapers put in <SEP>
He broke my wrist <SEP>  Grenn said again <SEP> holding it out to Noye for inspection <SEP>
The armorer gave the offered wrist the briefest of glances <SEP>  A bruise <SEP> Perhaps a sprain <SEP> Maestor Aemon will give you a salve <SEP> Go with him <SEP> Todder <SEP> that head wants looking after <SEP> The rest of you <SEP> return to your cells <SEP> Not you <SEP> Snow <SEP> You stay <SEP>
Jon sat heavily on the long wooden bench as the others left <SEP> oblivious to the looks they gave him <SEP> the silent promises of future retribution <SEP> His arm was throbbing <SEP>
The Watch has need of every man it can get <SEP>  Donal Noye said when they were alone <SEP>  Even men like Toad <SEP> You won ’ t win any honors killing him <SEP>
Jon ’ s anger flared <SEP> <BOS> He said my mother was— <EOS>
—a whore <SEP> I heard him <SEP> What of it?
Jon said icily <SEP> <BOS> Lord Eddard Stark was not a man to sleep with whores <SEP> His honor— <EOS>
—did not prevent him from fathering a bastard <SEP> Did it?
Jon was cold with rage <SEP> <BOS> Can I go? <EOS>
You go when I tell you to go <SEP>
Jon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier <SEP> until Noye took him under the chin <SEP> thick fingers twisting his head around <SEP> <BOS> Look at me when I ’ m talking to you <SEP> boy <SEP> <EOS>
Jon looked <SEP> The armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match <SEP> His nose was flat and broad <SEP> and he always seemed in need of a shave <SEP> The left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword <SEP> <BOS> Words won ’ t make your mother a whore <SEP> She was what she was <SEP> and nothing Toad says can change that <SEP> You know <SEP> we have men on the Wall whose mothers were whores <SEP> <EOS>
Not my mother <SEP> Jon thought stubbornly <SEP> He knew nothing of his mother; Eddard Stark would not talk of her <SEP> Yet he dreamed of her at times <SEP> so often that he could almost see her face <SEP> In his dreams <SEP> she was beautiful <SEP> and highborn <SEP> and her eyes were kind <SEP>
You think you had it hard <SEP> being a high lord ’ s bastard?  the armorer went on <SEP>  That boy Jeren is a septon ’ s get <SEP> and Cotter Pyke is the baseborn son of a tavern wench <SEP> Now he commands Eastwatch by the Sea <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> <BOS> I don ’ t care <SEP> I don ’ t care about them and I don ’ t care about you or Thorne or Benjen Stark or any of it <SEP> I hate it here <SEP> It ’ s too … it ’ s cold <SEP> <EOS>
Yes <SEP> Cold and hard and mean <SEP> that ’ s the Wall <SEP> and the men who walk it <SEP> Not like the stories your wet nurse told you <SEP> Well <SEP> piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse <SEP> This is the way it is <SEP> and you ’ re here for life <SEP> same as the rest of us <SEP>
Jon repeated bitterly <SEP> The armorer could talk about life <SEP> He ’ d had one <SEP> He ’ d only taken the black after he ’ d lost an arm at the siege of Storm ’ s End <SEP> Before that he ’ d smithed for Stannis Baratheon <SEP> the king ’ s brother <SEP> He ’ d seen the Seven Kingdoms from one end to the other; he ’ d feasted and wenched and fought in a hundred battles <SEP> They said it was Donal Noye who ’ d forged King Robert ’ s warhammer <SEP> the one that crushed the life from Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident <SEP> He ’ d done all the things that Jon would never do <SEP> and then when he was old <SEP> well past thirty <SEP> he ’ d taken a glancing blow from an axe and the wound had festered until the whole arm had to come off <SEP> Only then <SEP> crippled <SEP> had Donal Noye come to the Wall <SEP> when his life was all but over <SEP> <BOS> Life <SEP> <EOS>
Yes <SEP> life <SEP>  Noye said <SEP>  A long life or a short one <SEP> it ’ s up to you <SEP> Snow <SEP> The road you ’ re walking <SEP> one of your brothers will slit your throat for you one night <SEP>
Jon snapped <SEP> <BOS> They ’ re not my brothers <SEP> They hate me because I ’ m better than they are <SEP> <EOS>
No <SEP> They hate you because you act like you ’ re better than they are <SEP> They look at you and see a castle-bred bastard who thinks he ’ s a lordling<SEP>  The armorer leaned close <SEP>  You ’ re no lordling <SEP> Remember that <SEP> You ’ re a Snow <SEP> not a Stark <SEP> You ’ re a bastard and a bully <SEP>
A bully?  Jon almost choked on the word <SEP> The accusation was so unjust it took his breath away <SEP>  They were the ones who came after me <SEP> Four of them <SEP>
Four that you ’ ve humiliated in the yard <SEP> Four who are probably afraid of you <SEP> I ’ ve watched you fight <SEP> It ’ s not training with you <SEP> Put a good edge on your sword <SEP> and they ’ d be dead meat; you know it <SEP> I know it <SEP> they know it <SEP> You leave them nothing <SEP> You shame them <SEP> Does that make you proud?
Jon hesitated <SEP> He did feel proud when he won <SEP> Why shouldn ’ t he? But the armorer was taking that away too <SEP> making it sound as if he were doing something wrong <SEP> <BOS> They ’ re all older than me <SEP> <EOS> he said defensively <SEP>
Older and bigger and stronger <SEP> that ’ s the truth <SEP> I ’ ll wager your master-at-arms taught you how to fight bigger men at Winterfell <SEP> though <SEP> Who was he <SEP> some old knight?
Jon said warily <SEP> There was a trap here <SEP> He felt it closing around him <SEP> <BOS> Ser Rodrik Cassel <SEP> <EOS>
Donal Noye leaned forward <SEP> into Jon ’ s face <SEP>  Now think on this <SEP> boy <SEP> None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser <SEP> Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers <SEP> smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley <SEP> What they know of fighting they learned between decks <SEP> in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport <SEP> in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad <SEP> They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here <SEP> but I promise you <SEP> not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword<SEP>  His look was grim <SEP>  So how do you like the taste of your victories now <SEP> Lord Snow?
Jon said sharply <SEP> but the force had gone out of his anger <SEP> Suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty <SEP> <BOS> Don ’ t call me that! I never … I didn ’ t think … <EOS>
Best you start thinking <SEP>  Noye warned him <SEP>  That <SEP> or sleep with a dagger by your bed <SEP> Now go <SEP>
By the time Jon left the armory <SEP> it was almost midday <SEP> The sun had broken through the clouds <SEP> He turned his back on it and lifted his eyes to the Wall <SEP> blazing blue and crystalline in the sunlight <SEP> Even after all these weeks <SEP> the sight of it still gave him the shivers <SEP> Centuries of windblown dirt had pocked and scoured it <SEP> covering it like a film <SEP> and it often seemed a pale grey <SEP> the color of an overcast sky … but when the sun caught it fair on a bright day <SEP> it shone <SEP> alive with light <SEP> a colossal blue-white cliff that filled up half the sky <SEP>
The largest structure ever built by the hands of man <SEP> Benjen Stark had told Jon on the kingsroad when they had first caught sight of the Wall in the distance <SEP>  And beyond a doubt the most useless <SEP>  Tyrion Lannister had added with a grin <SEP> but even the Imp grew silent as they rode closer <SEP> You could see it from miles off <SEP> a pale blue line across the northern horizon <SEP> stretching away to the east and west and vanishing in the far distance <SEP> immense and unbroken <SEP> This is the end of the world <SEP> it seemed to say <SEP>
When they finally spied Castle Black <SEP> its timbered keeps and stone towers looked like nothing more than a handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow <SEP> beneath the vast wall of ice <SEP> The ancient stronghold of the black brothers was no Winterfell <SEP> no true castle at all <SEP> Lacking walls <SEP> it could not be defended <SEP> not from the south <SEP> or east <SEP> or west; but it was only the north that concerned the Night ’ s Watch <SEP> and to the north loomed the Wall <SEP> Almost seven hundred feet high it stood <SEP> three times the height of the tallest tower in the stronghold it sheltered <SEP> His uncle said the top was wide enough for a dozen armored knights to ride abreast <SEP> The gaunt outlines of huge catapults and monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry up there <SEP> like the skeletons of great birds <SEP> and among them walked men in black as small as ants <SEP>
As he stood outside the armory looking up <SEP> Jon felt almost as overwhelmed as he had that day on the kingsroad <SEP> when he ’ d seen it for the first time <SEP> The Wall was like that <SEP> Sometimes he could almost forget that it was there <SEP> the way you forgot about the sky or the earth underfoot <SEP> but there were other times when it seemed as if there was nothing else in the world <SEP> It was older than the Seven Kingdoms <SEP> and when he stood beneath it and looked up <SEP> it made Jon dizzy <SEP> He could feel the great weight of all that ice pressing down on him <SEP> as if it were about to topple <SEP> and somehow Jon knew that if it fell <SEP> the world fell with it <SEP>
Makes you wonder what lies beyond <SEP>  a familiar voice said <SEP>
Jon looked around <SEP> <BOS> Lannister <SEP> I didn ’ t see—I mean <SEP> I thought I was alone <SEP> <EOS>
Tyrion Lannister was bundled in furs so thickly he looked like a very small bear <SEP>  There ’ s much to be said for taking people unawares <SEP> You never know what you might learn <SEP>
Jon told him <SEP> He had seen little of the dwarf since their journey ended <SEP> As the queen ’ s own brother <SEP> Tyrion Lannister had been an honored guest of the Night ’ s Watch <SEP> The Lord Commander had given him rooms in the King ’ s Tower—so-called <SEP> though no king had visited it for a hundred years—and Lannister dined at Mormont ’ s own table and spent his days riding the Wall and his nights dicing and drinking with Ser Alliser and Bowen Marsh and the other high officers <SEP> <BOS> You won ’ t learn anything from me <SEP> <EOS>
Oh <SEP> I learn things everywhere I go<SEP>  The little man gestured up at the Wall with a gnarled black walking stick <SEP>  As I was saying … why is it that when one man builds a wall <SEP> the next man immediately needs to know what ’ s on the other side?  He cocked his head and looked at Jon with his curious mismatched eyes <SEP>  You do want to know what ’ s on the other side <SEP> don ’ t you?
Jon said <SEP> He wanted to ride with Benjen Stark on his rangings <SEP> deep into the mysteries of the haunted forest <SEP> wanted to fight Mance Rayder ’ s wildlings and ward the realm against the Others <SEP> but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted <SEP> <BOS> It ’ s nothing special <SEP> The rangers say it ’ s just woods and mountains and frozen lakes <SEP> with lots of snow and ice <SEP> <EOS>
And the grumkins and the snarks <SEP>  Tyrion said <SEP>  Let us not forget them <SEP> Lord Snow <SEP> or else what ’ s that big thing for?
Don ’ t call me Lord Snow <SEP>
The dwarf lifted an eyebrow <SEP>  Would you rather be called the Imp? Let them see that their words can cut you <SEP> and you ’ ll never be free of the mockery <SEP> If they want to give you a name <SEP> take it <SEP> make it your own <SEP> Then they can ’ t hurt you with it anymore<SEP>  He gestured with his stick <SEP>  Come <SEP> walk with me <SEP> They ’ ll be serving some vile stew in the common hall by now <SEP> and I could do with a bowl of something hot <SEP>
Jon was hungry too <SEP> so he fell in beside Lannister and slowed his pace to match the dwarf ’ s awkward <SEP> waddling steps <SEP> The wind was rising <SEP> and they could hear the old wooden buildings creaking around them <SEP> and in the distance a heavy shutter banging <SEP> over and over <SEP> forgotten <SEP> Once there was a muffled thump as a blanket of snow slid from a roof and landed near them <SEP>
I don ’ t see your wolf <SEP>  Lannister said as they walked <SEP>
I chain him up in the old stables when we ’ re training <SEP> They board all the horses in the east stables now <SEP> so no one bothers him <SEP> The rest of the time he stays with me <SEP> My sleeping cell is in Hardin ’ s Tower <SEP>
That ’ s the one with the broken battlement <SEP> no? Shattered stone in the yard below <SEP> and a lean to it like our noble king Robert after a long night ’ s drinking? I thought all those buildings had been abandoned <SEP>
Jon shrugged <SEP> <BOS> No one cares where you sleep <SEP> Most of the old keeps are empty <SEP> you can pick any cell you want<SEP> <EOS> Once Castle Black had housed five thousand fighting men with all their horses and servants and weapons <SEP> Now it was home to a tenth that number <SEP> and parts of it were falling into ruin <SEP>
Tyrion Lannister ’ s laughter steamed in the cold air <SEP>  I ’ ll be sure to tell your father to arrest more stonemasons <SEP> before your tower collapses <SEP>
Jon could taste the mockery there <SEP> but there was no denying the truth <SEP> The Watch had built nineteen great strongholds along the Wall <SEP> but only three were still occupied: Eastwatch on its grey windswept shore <SEP> the Shadow Tower hard by the mountains where the Wall ended <SEP> and Castle Black between them <SEP> at the end of the kingsroad <SEP> The other keeps <SEP> long deserted <SEP> were lonely <SEP> haunted places <SEP> where cold winds whistled through black windows and the spirits of the dead manned the parapets <SEP>
Jon said stubbornly <SEP> <BOS> It ’ s better that I ’ m by myself <SEP> The rest of them are scared of Ghost <SEP> <EOS>
Wise boys <SEP>  Lannister said <SEP> Then he changed the subject <SEP>  The talk is <SEP> your uncle is too long away <SEP>
Jon remembered the wish he ’ d wished in his anger <SEP> the vision of Benjen Stark dead in the snow <SEP> and he looked away quickly <SEP> The dwarf had a way of sensing things <SEP> and Jon did not want him to see the guilt in his eyes <SEP>  He said he ’ d be back by my name day <SEP>  he admitted <SEP> His name day had come and gone <SEP> unremarked <SEP> a fortnight past <SEP>  They were looking for Ser Waymar Royce <SEP> his father is bannerman to Lord Arryn <SEP> Uncle Benjen said they might search as far as the Shadow Tower <SEP> That ’ s all the way up in the mountains <SEP>
I hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late <SEP>  Lannister said as they mounted the steps to the common hall <SEP> He grinned and pulled open the door <SEP>  Perhaps the grumkins are hungry this year <SEP>
Inside <SEP> the hall was immense and drafty <SEP> even with a fire roaring in its great hearth <SEP> Crows nested in the timbers of its lofty ceiling <SEP> Jon heard their cries overhead as he accepted a bowl of stew and a heel of black bread from the day ’ s cooks <SEP> Grenn and Toad and some of the others were seated at the bench nearest the warmth <SEP> laughing and cursing each other in rough voices <SEP> Jon eyed them thoughtfully for a moment <SEP> Then he chose a spot at the far end of the hall <SEP> well away from the other diners <SEP>
Tyrion Lannister sat across from him <SEP> sniffing at the stew suspiciously <SEP>  Barley <SEP> onion <SEP> carrot <SEP>  he muttered <SEP>  Someone should tell the cooks that turnip isn ’ t a meat <SEP>
Jon pulled off his gloves and warmed his hands in the steam rising from the bowl <SEP> The smell made his mouth water <SEP> <BOS> It ’ s mutton stew<SEP> <EOS>
Snow <SEP>
Jon knew Alliser Thorne ’ s voice <SEP> but there was a curious note in it that he had not heard before <SEP> He turned <SEP>
The Lord Commander wants to see you <SEP> Now <SEP>
For a moment Jon was too frightened to move <SEP> Why would the Lord Commander want to see him? They had heard something about Benjen <SEP> he thought wildly <SEP> he was dead <SEP> the vision had come true <SEP>  Is it my uncle?  he blurted <SEP>  Is he returned safe?
The Lord Commander is not accustomed to waiting <SEP>  was Ser Alliser ’ s reply <SEP>  And I am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards <SEP>
Tyrion Lannister swung off the bench and rose <SEP>  Stop it <SEP> Thorne <SEP> You ’ re frightening the boy <SEP>
Keep out of matters that don ’ t concern you <SEP> Lannister <SEP> You have no place here <SEP>
I have a place at court <SEP> though <SEP>  the dwarf said <SEP> smiling <SEP>  A word in the right ear <SEP> and you ’ ll die a sour old man before you get another boy to train <SEP> Now tell Snow why the Old Bear needs to see him <SEP> Is there news of his uncle?
No <SEP>  Ser Alliser said <SEP>  This is another matter entirely <SEP> A bird arrived this morning from Winterfell <SEP> with a message that concerns his brother<SEP>  He corrected himself <SEP>  His half brother <SEP>
Jon breathed <SEP> scrambling to his feet <SEP> <BOS> Bran <SEP> Something ’ s happened to Bran <SEP> <EOS>
Tyrion Lannister laid a hand on his arm <SEP>  Jon <SEP>  he said <SEP>  I am truly sorry <SEP>
Jon scarcely heard him <SEP> He brushed off Tyrion ’ s hand and strode across the hall <SEP> He was running by the time he hit the doors <SEP> He raced to the Commander ’ s Keep <SEP> dashing through drifts of old snow <SEP> When the guards passed him <SEP> he took the tower steps two at a time <SEP> By the time he burst into the presence of the Lord Commander <SEP> his boots were soaked and Jon was wild-eyed and panting <SEP>  Bran <SEP>  he said <SEP>  What does it say about Bran?
Jeor Mormont <SEP> Lord Commander of the Night ’ s Watch <SEP> was a gruff old man with an immense bald head and a shaggy grey beard <SEP> He had a raven on his arm <SEP> and he was feeding it kernels of corn <SEP>  I am told you can read<SEP>  He shook the raven off <SEP> and it flapped its wings and flew to the window <SEP> where it sat watching as Mormont drew a roll of paper from his belt and handed it to Jon <SEP>  Corn <SEP>  it muttered in a raucous voice <SEP>  Corn <SEP> corn <SEP>
Jon ’ s finger traced the outline of the direwolf in the white wax of the broken seal <SEP> He recognized Robb ’ s hand <SEP> but the letters seemed to blur and run as he tried to read them <SEP> He realized he was crying <SEP> And then <SEP> through the tears <SEP> he found the sense in the words <SEP> and raised his head <SEP>  He woke up <SEP>  he said <SEP>  The gods gave him back <SEP>
Crippled <SEP>  Mormont said <SEP>  I ’ m sorry <SEP> boy <SEP> Read the rest of the letter <SEP>
He looked at the words <SEP> but they didn ’ t matter <SEP> Nothing mattered <SEP> Bran was going to live <SEP>  My brother is going to live <SEP>  he told Mormont <SEP> The Lord Commander shook his head <SEP> gathered up a fistful of corn <SEP> and whistled <SEP> The raven flew to his shoulder <SEP> crying <SEP>  Live! Live!
Jon ran down the stairs <SEP> a smile on his face and Robb ’ s letter in his hand <SEP>  My brother is going to live <SEP>  he told the guards <SEP> They exchanged a look <SEP> He ran back to the common hall <SEP> where he found Tyrion Lannister just finishing his meal <SEP> He grabbed the little man under the arms <SEP> hoisted him up in the air <SEP> and spun him around in a circle <SEP>  Bran is going to live!  he whooped <SEP> Lannister looked startled <SEP> Jon put him down and thrust the paper into his hands <SEP>  Here <SEP> read it <SEP>  he said <SEP>
Others were gathering around and looking at him curiously <SEP> Jon noticed Grenn a few feet away <SEP> A thick woolen bandage was wrapped around one hand <SEP> He looked anxious and uncomfortable <SEP> not menacing at all <SEP> Jon went to him <SEP> Grenn edged backward and put up his hands <SEP>  Stay away from me now <SEP> you bastard <SEP>
Jon smiled at him <SEP> <BOS> I ’ m sorry about your wrist <SEP> Robb used the same move on me once <SEP> only with a wooden blade <SEP> It hurt like seven hells <SEP> but yours must be worse <SEP> Look <SEP> if you want <SEP> I can show you how to defend that <SEP> <EOS>
Alliser Thorne overheard him <SEP>  Lord Snow wants to take my place now<SEP>  He sneered <SEP>  I ’ d have an easier time teaching a wolf to juggle than you will training this aurochs <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> <BOS> I ’ ll take that wager <SEP> Ser Alliser <SEP> I ’ d love to see Ghost juggle <SEP> <EOS>
Jon heard Grenn suck in his breath <SEP> shocked <SEP> Silence fell <SEP>
Then Tyrion Lannister guffawed <SEP> Three of the black brothers joined in from a nearby table <SEP> The laughter spread up and down the benches <SEP> until even the cooks joined in <SEP> The birds stirred in the rafters <SEP> and finally even Grenn began to chuckle <SEP>
Ser Alliser never took his eyes from Jon <SEP> As the laughter rolled around him <SEP> his face darkened <SEP> and his sword hand curled into a fist <SEP>  That was a grievous error <SEP> Lord Snow <SEP>  he said at last in the acid tones of an enemy <SEP>
EDDARD
Eddard Stark rode through the towering bronze doors of the Red Keep sore <SEP> tired <SEP> hungry <SEP> and irritable <SEP> He was still ahorse <SEP> dreaming of a long hot soak <SEP> a roast fowl <SEP> and a featherbed <SEP> when the king ’ s steward told him that Grand Maester Pycelle had convened an urgent meeting of the small council <SEP> The honor of the Hand ’ s presence was requested as soon as it was convenient <SEP>  It will be convenient on the morrow <SEP>  Ned snapped as he dismounted <SEP>
The steward bowed very low <SEP>  I shall give the councillors your regrets <SEP> my lord <SEP>
No <SEP> damn it <SEP>  Ned said <SEP> It would not do to offend the council before he had even begun <SEP>  I will see them <SEP> Pray give me a few moments to change into something more presentable <SEP>
Yes <SEP> my lord <SEP>  the steward said <SEP>  We have given you Lord Arryn ’ s former chambers in the Tower of the Hand <SEP> if it please you <SEP> I shall have your things taken there <SEP>
My thanks <SEP>  Ned said as he ripped off his riding gloves and tucked them into his belt <SEP> The rest of his household was coming through the gate behind him <SEP> Ned saw Vayon Poole <SEP> his own steward <SEP> and called out <SEP>  It seems the council has urgent need of me <SEP> See that my daughters find their bedchambers <SEP> and tell Jory to keep them there <SEP> Arya is not to go exploring <SEP>  Poole bowed <SEP> Ned turned back to the royal steward <SEP>  My wagons are still straggling through the city <SEP> I shall need appropriate garments <SEP>
It will be my great pleasure <SEP>  the steward said <SEP>
And so Ned had come striding into the council chambers <SEP> bone-tired and dressed in borrowed clothing <SEP> to find four members of the small council waiting for him <SEP>
The chamber was richly furnished <SEP> Myrish carpets covered the floor instead of rushes <SEP> and in one corner a hundred fabulous beasts cavorted in bright paints on a carved screen from the Summer Isles <SEP> The walls were hung with tapestries from Norvos and Qohor and Lys <SEP> and a pair of Valyrian sphinxes flanked the door <SEP> eyes of polished garnet smoldering in black marble faces <SEP>
The councillor Ned liked least <SEP> the eunuch Varys <SEP> accosted him the moment he entered <SEP>  Lord Stark <SEP> I was grievous sad to hear about your troubles on the kingsroad <SEP> We have all been visiting the sept to light candles for Prince Joffrey <SEP> I pray for his recovery<SEP>  His hand left powder stains on Ned ’ s sleeve <SEP> and he smelled as foul and sweet as flowers on a grave <SEP>
Your gods have heard you <SEP>  Ned replied <SEP> cool yet polite <SEP>  The prince grows stronger every day<SEP>  He disentangled himself from the eunuch ’ s grip and crossed the room to where Lord Renly stood by the screen <SEP> talking quietly with a short man who could only be Littlefinger <SEP> Renly had been a boy of eight when Robert won the throne <SEP> but he had grown into a man so like his brother that Ned found it disconcerting <SEP> Whenever he saw him <SEP> it was as if the years had slipped away and Robert stood before him <SEP> fresh from his victory on the Trident <SEP>
I see you have arrived safely <SEP> Lord Stark <SEP>  Renly said <SEP>
And you as well <SEP>  Ned replied <SEP>  You must forgive me <SEP> but sometimes you look the very image of your brother Robert <SEP>
A poor copy <SEP>  Renly said with a shrug <SEP>
Though much better dressed <SEP>  Littlefinger quipped <SEP>  Lord Renly spends more on clothing than half the ladies of the court <SEP>
It was true enough <SEP> Lord Renly was in dark green velvet <SEP> with a dozen golden stags embroidered on his doublet <SEP> A cloth-of-gold half cape was draped casually across one shoulder <SEP> fastened with an emerald brooch <SEP>  There are worse crimes <SEP>  Renly said with a laugh <SEP>  The way you dress <SEP> for one <SEP>
Littlefinger ignored the jibe <SEP> He eyed Ned with a smile on his lips that bordered on insolence <SEP>  I have hoped to meet you for some years <SEP> Lord Stark <SEP> No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me to you <SEP>
She has <SEP>  Ned replied with a chill in his voice <SEP> The sly arrogance of the comment rankled him <SEP>  I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well <SEP>
Renly Baratheon laughed <SEP> Varys shuffled over to listen <SEP>
Rather too well <SEP>  Littlefinger said <SEP>  I still carry a token of his esteem <SEP> Did Brandon speak of me too?
Often <SEP> and with some heat <SEP>  Ned said <SEP> hoping that would end it <SEP> He had no patience with this game they played <SEP> this dueling with words <SEP>
I should have thought that heat ill suits you Starks <SEP>  Littlefinger said <SEP>  Here in the south <SEP> they say you are all made of ice <SEP> and melt when you ride below the Neck <SEP>
I do not plan on melting soon <SEP> Lord Baelish <SEP> You may count on it<SEP>  Ned moved to the council table and said <SEP>  Maester Pycelle <SEP> I trust you are well <SEP>
The Grand Maester smiled gently from his tall chair at the foot of the table <SEP>  Well enough for a man of my years <SEP> my lord <SEP>  he replied <SEP>  yet I do tire easily <SEP> I fear<SEP>  Wispy strands of white hair fringed the broad bald dome of his forehead above a kindly face <SEP> His maester ’ s collar was no simple metal choker such as Luwin wore <SEP> but two dozen heavy chains wound together into a ponderous metal necklace that covered him from throat to breast <SEP> The links were forged of every metal known to man: black iron and red gold <SEP> bright copper and dull lead <SEP> steel and tin and pale silver <SEP> brass and bronze and platinum <SEP> Garnets and amethysts and black pearls adorned the metal-work <SEP> and here and there an emerald or ruby <SEP>  Perhaps we might begin soon <SEP>  the Grand Maester said <SEP> hands knitting together atop his broad stomach <SEP>  I fear I shall fall asleep if we wait much longer <SEP>
As you will<SEP>  The king ’ s seat sat empty at the head of the table <SEP> the crowned stag of Baratheon embroidered in gold thread on its pillows <SEP> Ned took the chair beside it <SEP> as the right hand of his king <SEP>  My lords <SEP>  he said formally <SEP>  I am sorry to have kept you waiting <SEP>
You are the King ’ s Hand <SEP>  Varys said <SEP>  We serve at your pleasure <SEP> Lord Stark <SEP>
As the others took their accustomed seats <SEP> it struck Eddard Stark forcefully that he did not belong here <SEP> in this room <SEP> with these men <SEP> He remembered what Robert had told him in the crypts below Winterfell <SEP> I am surrounded by flatterers and fools <SEP> the king had insisted <SEP> Ned looked down the council table and wondered which were the flatterers and which the fools <SEP> He thought he knew already <SEP>  We are but five <SEP>  he pointed out <SEP>
Lord Stannis took himself to Dragonstone not long after the king went north <SEP>  Varys said <SEP>  and our gallant Ser Barristan no doubt rides beside the king as he makes his way through the city <SEP> as befits the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard <SEP>
Perhaps we had best wait for Ser Barristan and the king to join us <SEP>  Ned suggested <SEP>
Renly Baratheon laughed aloud <SEP>  If we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence <SEP> it could be a long sit <SEP>
Our good King Robert has many cares <SEP>  Varys said <SEP>  He entrusts some small matters to us <SEP> to lighten his load <SEP>
What Lord Varys means is that all this business of coin and crops and justice bores my royal brother to tears <SEP>  Lord Renly said <SEP>  so it falls to us to govern the realm <SEP> He does send us a command from time to time<SEP>  He drew a tightly rolled paper from his sleeve and laid it on the table <SEP>  This morning he commanded me to ride ahead with all haste and ask Grand Maester Pycelle to convene this council at once <SEP> He has an urgent task for us <SEP>
Littlefinger smiled and handed the paper to Ned <SEP> It bore the royal seal <SEP> Ned broke the wax with his thumb and flattened the letter to consider the king ’ s urgent command <SEP> reading the words with mounting disbelief <SEP> Was there no end to Robert ’ s folly? And to do this in his name <SEP> that was salt in the wound <SEP>  Gods be good <SEP>  he swore <SEP>
What Lord Eddard means to say <SEP>  Lord Renly announced <SEP>  is that His Grace instructs us to stage a great tournament in honor of his appointment as the Hand of the King <SEP>
How much?  asked Littlefinger <SEP> mildly <SEP>
Ned read the answer off the letter <SEP>  Forty thousand golden dragons to the champion <SEP> Twenty thousand to the man who comes second <SEP> another twenty to the winner of the melee <SEP> and ten thousand to the victor of the archery competition <SEP>
Ninety thousand gold pieces <SEP>  Littlefinger sighed <SEP>  And we must not neglect the other costs <SEP> Robert will want a prodigious feast <SEP> That means cooks <SEP> carpenters <SEP> serving girls <SEP> singers <SEP> jugglers <SEP> fools …
Fools we have in plenty <SEP>  Lord Renly said <SEP>
Grand Maester Pycelle looked to Littlefinger and asked <SEP>  Will the treasury bear the expense?
What treasury is that?  Littlefinger replied with a twist of his mouth <SEP>  Spare me the foolishness <SEP> Maester <SEP> You know as well as I that the treasury has been empty for years <SEP> I shall have to borrow the money <SEP> No doubt the Lannisters will be accommodating <SEP> We owe Lord Tywin some three million dragons at present <SEP> what matter another hundred thousand?
Ned was stunned <SEP>  Are you claiming that the Crown is three million gold pieces in debt?
The Crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt <SEP> Lord Stark <SEP> The Lannisters are the biggest part of it <SEP> but we have also borrowed from Lord Tyrell <SEP> the Iron Bank of Braavos <SEP> and several Tyroshi trading cartels <SEP> Of late I ’ ve had to turn to the Faith <SEP> The High Septon haggles worse than a Dornish fishmonger <SEP>
Ned was aghast <SEP>  Aerys Targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold <SEP> How could you let this happen?
Littlefinger gave a shrug <SEP>  The master of coin finds the money <SEP> The king and the Hand spend it <SEP>
I will not believe that Jon Arryn allowed Robert to beggar the realm <SEP>  Ned said hotly <SEP>
Grand Maester Pycelle shook his great bald head <SEP> his chains clinking softly <SEP>  Lord Arryn was a prudent man <SEP> but I fear that His Grace does not always listen to wise counsel <SEP>
My royal brother loves tournaments and feasts <SEP>  Renly Baratheon said <SEP>  and he loathes what he calls ‘ counting coppers <SEP> ’
I will speak with His Grace <SEP>  Ned said <SEP>  This tourney is an extravagance the realm cannot afford <SEP>
Speak to him as you will <SEP>  Lord Renly said <SEP>  we had still best make our plans <SEP>
Another day <SEP>  Ned said <SEP> Perhaps too sharply <SEP> from the looks they gave him <SEP> He would have to remember that he was no longer in Winterfell <SEP> where only the king stood higher; here <SEP> he was but first among equals <SEP>  Forgive me <SEP> my lords <SEP>  he said in a softer tone <SEP>  I am tired <SEP> Let us call a halt for today and resume when we are fresher<SEP>  He did not ask for their consent <SEP> but stood abruptly <SEP> nodded at them all <SEP> and made for the door <SEP>
Outside <SEP> wagons and riders were still pouring through the castle gates <SEP> and the yard was a chaos of mud and horseflesh and shouting men <SEP> The king had not yet arrived <SEP> he was told <SEP> Since the ugliness on the Trident <SEP> the Starks and their household had ridden well ahead of the main column <SEP> the better to separate themselves from the Lannisters and the growing tension <SEP> Robert had hardly been seen; the talk was he was traveling in the huge wheelhouse <SEP> drunk as often as not <SEP> If so <SEP> he might be hours behind <SEP> but he would still be here too soon for Ned ’ s liking <SEP> He had only to look at Sansa ’ s face to feel the rage twisting inside him once again <SEP> The last fortnight of their journey had been a misery <SEP> Sansa blamed Arya and told her that it should have been Nymeria who died <SEP> And Arya was lost after she heard what had happened to her butcher ’ s boy <SEP> Sansa cried herself to sleep <SEP> Arya brooded silently all day long <SEP> and Eddard Stark dreamed of a frozen hell reserved for the Starks of Winterfell <SEP>
He crossed the outer yard <SEP> passed under a portcullis into the inner bailey <SEP> and was walking toward what he thought was the Tower of the Hand when Littlefinger appeared in front of him <SEP>  You ’ re going the wrong way <SEP> Stark <SEP> Come with me <SEP>
Hesitantly <SEP> Ned followed <SEP> Littlefinger led him into a tower <SEP> down a stair <SEP> across a small sunken courtyard <SEP> and along a deserted corridor where empty suits of armor stood sentinel along the walls <SEP> They were relics of the Targaryens <SEP> black steel with dragon scales cresting their helms <SEP> now dusty and forgotten <SEP>  This is not the way to my chambers <SEP>  Ned said <SEP>
Did I say it was? I ’ m leading you to the dungeons to slit your throat and seal your corpse up behind a wall <SEP>  Littlefinger replied <SEP> his voice dripping with sarcasm <SEP>  We have no time for this <SEP> Stark <SEP> Your wife awaits <SEP>
What game are you playing <SEP> Littlefinger? Catelyn is at Winterfell <SEP> hundreds of leagues from here <SEP>
Oh?  Littlefinger ’ s grey-green eyes glittered with amusement <SEP>  Then it appears someone has managed an astonishing impersonation <SEP> For the last time <SEP> come <SEP> Or don ’ t come <SEP> and I ’ ll keep her for myself<SEP>  He hurried down the steps <SEP>
Ned followed him warily <SEP> wondering if this day would ever end <SEP> He had no taste for these intrigues <SEP> but he was beginning to realize that they were meat and mead to a man like Littlefinger <SEP>
At the foot of the steps was a heavy door of oak and iron <SEP> Petyr Baelish lifted the crossbar and gestured Ned through <SEP> They stepped out into the ruddy glow of dusk <SEP> on a rocky bluff high above the river <SEP>  We ’ re outside the castle <SEP>  Ned said <SEP>
You are a hard man to fool <SEP> Stark <SEP>  Littlefinger said with a smirk <SEP>  Was it the sun that gave it away <SEP> or the sky? Follow me <SEP> There are niches cut in the rock <SEP> Try not to fall to your death <SEP> Catelyn would never understand<SEP>  With that <SEP> he was over the side of the cliff <SEP> descending as quick as a monkey <SEP>
Ned studied the rocky face of the bluff for a moment <SEP> then followed more slowly <SEP> The niches were there <SEP> as Littlefinger had promised <SEP> shallow cuts that would be invisible from below <SEP> unless you knew just where to look for them <SEP> The river was a long <SEP> dizzying distance below <SEP> Ned kept his face pressed to the rock and tried not to look down any more often than he had to <SEP>
When at last he reached the bottom <SEP> a narrow <SEP> muddy trail along the water ’ s edge <SEP> Littlefinger was lazing against a rock and eating an apple <SEP> He was almost down to the core <SEP>  You are growing old and slow <SEP> Stark <SEP>  he said <SEP> flipping the apple casually into the rushing water <SEP>  No matter <SEP> we ride the rest of the way<SEP>  He had two horses waiting <SEP> Ned mounted up and trotted behind him <SEP> down the trail and into the city <SEP>
Finally Baelish drew rein in front of a ramshackle building <SEP> three stories <SEP> timbered <SEP> its windows bright with lamplight in the gathering dusk <SEP> The sounds of music and raucous laughter drifted out and floated over the water <SEP> Beside the door swung an ornate oil lamp on a heavy chain <SEP> with a globe of leaded red glass <SEP>
Ned Stark dismounted in a fury <SEP>  A brothel <SEP>  he said as he seized Littlefinger by the shoulder and spun him around <SEP>  You ’ ve brought me all this way to take me to a brothel <SEP>
Your wife is inside <SEP>  Littlefinger said <SEP>
It was the final insult <SEP>  Brandon was too kind to you <SEP>  Ned said as he slammed the small man back against a wall and shoved his dagger up under the little pointed chin beard <SEP>
My lord <SEP> no <SEP>  an urgent voice called out <SEP>  He speaks the truth<SEP>  There were footsteps behind him <SEP>
Ned spun <SEP> knife in hand <SEP> as an old white-haired man hurried toward them <SEP> He was dressed in brown roughspun <SEP> and the soft flesh under his chin wobbled as he ran <SEP>  This is no business of yours <SEP>  Ned began; then <SEP> suddenly <SEP> the recognition came <SEP> He lowered the dagger <SEP> astonished <SEP>  Ser Rodrik?
Rodrik Cassel nodded <SEP>  Your lady awaits you upstairs <SEP>
Ned was lost <SEP>  Catelyn is truly here? This is not some strange jape of Littlefinger ’ s?  He sheathed his blade <SEP>
Would that it were <SEP> Stark <SEP>  Littlefinger said <SEP>  Follow me <SEP> and try to look a shade more lecherous and a shade less like the King ’ s Hand <SEP> It would not do to have you recognized <SEP> Perhaps you could fondle a breast or two <SEP> just in passing <SEP>
They went inside <SEP> through a crowded common room where a fat woman was singing bawdy songs while pretty young girls in linen shifts and wisps of colored silk pressed themselves against their lovers and dandled on their laps <SEP> No one paid Ned the least bit of attention <SEP> Ser Rodrik waited below while Littlefinger led him up to the third floor <SEP> along a corridor <SEP> and through a door <SEP>
Inside <SEP> Catelyn was waiting <SEP> She cried out when she saw him <SEP> ran to him <SEP> and embraced him fiercely <SEP>
My lady <SEP>  Ned whispered in wonderment <SEP>
Oh <SEP> very good <SEP>  said Littlefinger <SEP> closing the door <SEP>  You recognized her <SEP>
I feared you ’ d never come <SEP> my lord <SEP>  she whispered against his chest <SEP>  Petyr has been bringing me reports <SEP> He told me of your troubles with Arya and the young prince <SEP> How are my girls?
Both in mourning <SEP> and full of anger <SEP>  he told her <SEP>  Cat <SEP> I do not understand <SEP> What are you doing in King ’ s Landing? What ’ s happened?  Ned asked his wife <SEP>  Is it Bran? Is he …  Dead was the word that came to his lips <SEP> but he could not say it <SEP>
It is Bran <SEP> but not as you think <SEP>  Catelyn said <SEP>
Ned was lost <SEP>  Then how? Why are you here <SEP> my love? What is this place?
Just what it appears <SEP>  Littlefinger said <SEP> easing himself onto a window seat <SEP>  A brothel <SEP> Can you think of a less likely place to find a Catelyn Tully?  He smiled <SEP>  As it chances <SEP> I own this particular establishment <SEP> so arrangements were easily made <SEP> I am most anxious to keep the Lannisters from learning that Cat is here in King ’ s Landing <SEP>
Why?  Ned asked <SEP> He saw her hands then <SEP> the awkward way she held them <SEP> the raw red scars <SEP> the stiffness of the last two fingers on her left <SEP>  You ’ ve been hurt<SEP>  He took her hands in his own <SEP> turned them over <SEP>  Gods <SEP> Those are deep cuts … a gash from a sword or … how did this happen <SEP> my lady?
Catelyn slid a dagger out from under her cloak and placed it in his hand <SEP>  This blade was sent to open Bran ’ s throat and spill his life ’ s blood <SEP>
Ned ’ s head jerked up <SEP>  But … who … why would …
She put a finger to his lips <SEP>  Let me tell it all <SEP> my love <SEP> It will go faster that way <SEP> Listen <SEP>
So he listened <SEP> and she told it all <SEP> from the fire in the library tower to Varys and the guardsmen and Littlefinger <SEP> And when she was done <SEP> Eddard Stark sat dazed beside the table <SEP> the dagger in his hand <SEP> Bran ’ s wolf had saved the boy ’ s life <SEP> he thought dully <SEP> What was it that Jon had said when they found the pups in the snow? Your children were meant to have these pups <SEP> my lord <SEP> And he had killed Sansa ’ s <SEP> and for what? Was it guilt he was feeling? Or fear? If the gods had sent these wolves <SEP> what folly had he done?
Painfully <SEP> Ned forced his thoughts back to the dagger and what it meant <SEP>  The Imp ’ s dagger <SEP>  he repeated <SEP> It made no sense <SEP> His hand curled around the smooth dragonbone hilt <SEP> and he slammed the blade into the table <SEP> felt it bite into the wood <SEP> It stood mocking him <SEP>  Why should Tyrion Lannister want Bran dead? The boy has never done him harm <SEP>
Do you Starks have nought but snow between your ears?  Littlefinger asked <SEP>  The Imp would never have acted alone <SEP>
Ned rose and paced the length of the room <SEP>  If the queen had a role in this or <SEP> gods forbid <SEP> the king himself … no <SEP> I will not believe that<SEP>  Yet even as he said the words <SEP> he remembered that chill morning on the barrowlands <SEP> and Robert ’ s talk of sending hired knives after the Targaryen princess <SEP> He remembered Rhaegar ’ s infant son <SEP> the red ruin of his skull <SEP> and the way the king had turned away <SEP> as he had turned away in Darry ’ s audience hall not so long ago <SEP> He could still hear Sansa pleading <SEP> as Lyanna had pleaded once <SEP>
Most likely the king did not know <SEP>  Littlefinger said <SEP>  It would not be the first time <SEP> Our good Robert is practiced at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see <SEP>
Ned had no reply for that <SEP> The face of the butcher ’ s boy swam up before his eyes <SEP> cloven almost in two <SEP> and afterward the king had said not a word <SEP> His head was pounding <SEP>
Littlefinger sauntered over to the table <SEP> wrenched the knife from the wood <SEP>  The accusation is treason either way <SEP> Accuse the king and you will dance with Ilyn Payne before the words are out of your mouth <SEP> The queen … if you can find proof <SEP> and if you can make Robert listen <SEP> then perhaps …
We have proof <SEP>  Ned said <SEP>  We have the dagger <SEP>
This?  Littlefinger flipped the knife casually end over end <SEP>  A sweet piece of steel <SEP> but it cuts two ways <SEP> my lord <SEP> The Imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost or stolen while he was at Winterfell <SEP> and with his hireling dead <SEP> who is there to give him the lie?  He tossed the knife lightly to Ned <SEP>  My counsel is to drop that in the river and forget that it was ever forged <SEP>
Ned regarded him coldly <SEP>  Lord Baelish <SEP> I am a Stark of Winterfell <SEP> My son lies crippled <SEP> perhaps dying <SEP> He would be dead <SEP> and Catelyn with him <SEP> but for a wolf pup we found in the snow <SEP> If you truly believe I could forget that <SEP> you are as big a fool now as when you took up sword against my brother <SEP>
A fool I may be <SEP> Stark … yet I ’ m still here <SEP> while your brother has been moldering in his frozen grave for some fourteen years now <SEP> If you are so eager to molder beside him <SEP> far be it from me to dissuade you <SEP> but I would rather not be included in the party <SEP> thank you very much <SEP>
You would be the last man I would willingly include in any party <SEP> Lord Baelish <SEP>
You wound me deeply<SEP>  Littlefinger placed a hand over his heart <SEP>  For my part <SEP> I always found you Starks a tiresome lot <SEP> but Cat seems to have become attached to you <SEP> for reasons I cannot comprehend <SEP> I shall try to keep you alive for her sake <SEP> A fool ’ s task <SEP> admittedly <SEP> but I could never refuse your wife anything <SEP>
I told Petyr our suspicions about Jon Arryn ’ s death <SEP>  Catelyn said <SEP>  He has promised to help you find the truth <SEP>
That was not news that Eddard Stark welcomed <SEP> but it was true enough that they needed help <SEP> and Littlefinger had been almost a brother to Cat once <SEP> It would not be the first time that Ned had been forced to make common cause with a man he despised <SEP>  Very well <SEP>  he said <SEP> thrusting the dagger into his belt <SEP>  You spoke of Varys <SEP> Does the eunuch know all of it?
Not from my lips <SEP>  Catelyn said <SEP>  You did not wed a fool <SEP> Eddard Stark <SEP> But Varys has ways of learning things that no man could know <SEP> He has some dark art <SEP> Ned <SEP> I swear it <SEP>
He has spies <SEP> that is well known <SEP>  Ned said <SEP> dismissive <SEP>
It is more than that <SEP>  Catelyn insisted <SEP>  Ser Rodrik spoke to Ser Aron Santagar in all secrecy <SEP> yet somehow the Spider knew of their conversation <SEP> I fear that man <SEP>
Littlefinger smiled <SEP>  Leave Lord Varys to me <SEP> sweet lady <SEP> If you will permit me a small obscenity—and where better for it than here—I hold the man ’ s balls in the palm of my hand<SEP>  He cupped his fingers <SEP> smiling <SEP>  Or would <SEP> if he were a man <SEP> or had any balls <SEP> You see <SEP> if the pie is opened <SEP> the birds begin to sing <SEP> and Varys would not like that <SEP> Were I you <SEP> I would worry more about the Lannisters and less about the eunuch <SEP>
Ned did not need Littlefinger to tell him that <SEP> He was thinking back to the day Arya had been found <SEP> to the look on the queen ’ s face when she said <SEP> We have a wolf <SEP> so soft and quiet <SEP> He was thinking of the boy Mycah <SEP> of Jon Arryn ’ s sudden death <SEP> of Bran ’ s fall <SEP> of old mad Aerys Targaryen dying on the floor of his throne room while his life ’ s blood dried on a gilded blade <SEP>  My lady <SEP>  he said <SEP> turning to Catelyn <SEP>  there is nothing more you can do here <SEP> I want you to return to Winterfell at once <SEP> If there was one assassin <SEP> there could be others <SEP> Whoever ordered Bran ’ s death will learn soon enough that the boy still lives <SEP>
I had hoped to see the girls …  Catelyn said <SEP>
That would be most unwise <SEP>  Littlefinger put in <SEP>  The Red Keep is full of curious eyes <SEP> and children talk <SEP>
He speaks truly <SEP> my love <SEP>  Ned told her <SEP> He embraced her <SEP>  Take Ser Rodrik and ride for Winterfell <SEP> I will watch over the girls <SEP> Go home to our sons and keep them safe <SEP>
As you say <SEP> my lord<SEP>  Catelyn lifted her face <SEP> and Ned kissed her <SEP> Her maimed fingers clutched against his back with a desperate strength <SEP> as if to hold him safe forever in the shelter of her arms <SEP>
Would the lord and lady like the use of a bedchamber?  asked Littlefinger <SEP>  I should warn you <SEP> Stark <SEP> we usually charge for that sort of thing around here <SEP>
A moment alone <SEP> that ’ s all I ask <SEP>  Catelyn said <SEP>
Very well<SEP>  Littlefinger strolled to the door <SEP>  Don ’ t be too long <SEP> It is past time the Hand and I returned to the castle <SEP> before our absence is noted <SEP>
Catelyn went to him and took his hands in her own <SEP>  I will not forget the help you gave me <SEP> Petyr <SEP> When your men came for me <SEP> I did not know whether they were taking me to a friend or an enemy <SEP> I have found you more than a friend <SEP> I have found a brother I ’ d thought lost <SEP>
Petyr Baelish smiled <SEP>  I am desperately sentimental <SEP> sweet lady <SEP> Best not tell anyone <SEP> I have spent years convincing the court that I am wicked and cruel <SEP> and I should hate to see all that hard work go for naught <SEP>
Ned believed not a word of that <SEP> but he kept his voice polite as he said <SEP>  You have my thanks as well <SEP> Lord Baelish <SEP>
Oh <SEP> now there ’ s a treasure <SEP>  Littlefinger said <SEP> exiting <SEP>
When the door had closed behind him <SEP> Ned turned back to his wife <SEP>  Once you are home <SEP> send word to Helman Tallhart and Galbart Glover under my seal <SEP> They are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify Moat Cailin <SEP> Two hundred determined archers can hold the Neck against an army <SEP> Instruct Lord Manderly that he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at White Harbor <SEP> and see that they are well manned <SEP> And from this day on <SEP> I want a careful watch kept over Theon Greyjoy <SEP> If there is war <SEP> we shall have sore need of his father ’ s fleet <SEP>
War?  The fear was plain on Catelyn ’ s face <SEP>
It will not come to that <SEP>  Ned promised her <SEP> praying it was true <SEP> He took her in his arms again <SEP>  The Lannisters are merciless in the face of weakness <SEP> as Aerys Targaryen learned to his sorrow <SEP> but they would not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind them <SEP> and that they shall not have <SEP> I must play out this fool ’ s masquerade as if nothing is amiss <SEP> Remember why I came here <SEP> my love <SEP> If I find proof that the Lannisters murdered Jon Arryn …
He felt Catelyn tremble in his arms <SEP> Her scarred hands clung to him <SEP>  If <SEP>  she said <SEP>  what then <SEP> my love?
That was the most dangerous part <SEP> Ned knew <SEP>  All justice flows from the king <SEP>  he told her <SEP>  When I know the truth <SEP> I must go to Robert<SEP>  And pray that he is the man I think he is <SEP> he finished silently <SEP> and not the man I fear he has become <SEP>
Jon was showing Dareon how best to deliver a sidestroke when the new recruit entered the practice yard <SEP>  Your feet should be farther apart <SEP>  he urged <SEP>  You don ’ t want to lose your balance <SEP> That ’ s good <SEP> Now pivot as you deliver the stroke <SEP> get all your weight behind the blade <SEP>
Dareon broke off and lifted his visor <SEP>  Seven gods <SEP>  he murmured <SEP>  Would you look at this <SEP> Jon <SEP>
Jon turned <SEP> Through the eye slit of his helm <SEP> he beheld the fattest boy he had ever seen standing in the door of the armory <SEP> By the look of him <SEP> he must have weighed twenty stone <SEP> The fur collar of his embroidered surcoat was lost beneath his chins <SEP> Pale eyes moved nervously in a great round moon of a face <SEP> and plump sweaty fingers wiped themselves on the velvet of his doublet <SEP> <BOS> They … they told me I was to come here for … for training <SEP> <EOS> he said to no one in particular <SEP>
A lordling <SEP>  Pyp observed to Jon <SEP>  Southron <SEP> most like near Highgarden<SEP>  Pyp had traveled the Seven Kingdoms with a mummers ’ troupe <SEP> and bragged that he could tell what you were and where you ’ d been born just from the sound of your voice <SEP>
A striding huntsman had been worked in scarlet thread upon the breast of the fat boy ’ s fur-trimmed surcoat <SEP> Jon did not recognize the sigil <SEP> Ser Alliser Thorne looked over his new charge and said <SEP>  It would seem they have run short of poachers and thieves down south <SEP> Now they send us pigs to man the Wall <SEP> Is fur and velvet your notion of armor <SEP> my Lord of Ham?
It was soon revealed that the new recruit had brought his own armor with him; padded doublet <SEP> boiled leather <SEP> mail and plate and helm <SEP> even a great wood-and-leather shield blazoned with the same striding huntsman he wore on his surcoat <SEP> As none of it was black <SEP> however <SEP> Ser Alliser insisted that he reequip himself from the armory <SEP> That took half the morning <SEP> His girth required Donal Noye to take apart a mail hauberk and refit it with leather panels at the sides <SEP> To get a helm over his head the armorer had to detach the visor <SEP> His leathers bound so tightly around his legs and under his arms that he could scarcely move <SEP> Dressed for battle <SEP> the new boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst its skin <SEP>  Let us hope you are not as inept as you look <SEP>  Ser Alliser said <SEP>  Halder <SEP> see what Ser Piggy can do <SEP>
Jon Snow winced <SEP> Halder had been born in a quarry and apprenticed as a stonemason <SEP> He was sixteen <SEP> tall and muscular <SEP> and his blows were as hard as any Jon had ever felt <SEP> <BOS> This will be uglier than a whore ’ s ass <SEP> <EOS> Pyp muttered <SEP> and it was <SEP>
The fight lasted less than a minute before the fat boy was on the ground <SEP> his whole body shaking as blood leaked through his shattered helm and between his pudgy fingers <SEP>  I yield <SEP>  he shrilled <SEP>  No more <SEP> I yield <SEP> don ’ t hit me<SEP>  Rast and some of the other boys were laughing <SEP>
Even then <SEP> Ser Alliser would not call an end <SEP>  On your feet <SEP> Ser Piggy <SEP>  he called <SEP>  Pick up your sword<SEP>  When the boy continued to cling to the ground <SEP> Thorne gestured to Halder <SEP>  Hit him with the flat of your blade until he finds his feet<SEP>  Halder delivered a tentative smack to his foe ’ s upraised cheeks <SEP>  You can hit harder than that <SEP>  Thorne taunted <SEP> Halder took hold of his longsword with both hands and brought it down so hard the blow split leather <SEP> even on the flat <SEP> The new boy screeched in pain <SEP>
Jon Snow took a step forward <SEP> Pyp laid a mailed hand on his arm <SEP> <BOS> Jon <SEP> no <SEP> <EOS> the small boy whispered with an anxious glance at Ser Alliser Thorne <SEP>
On your feet <SEP>  Thorne repeated <SEP> The fat boy struggled to rise <SEP> slipped <SEP> and fell heavily again <SEP>  Ser Piggy is starting to grasp the notion <SEP>  Ser Alliser observed <SEP>  Again <SEP>
Halder lifted the sword for another blow <SEP>  Cut us off a ham!  Rast urged <SEP> laughing <SEP>
Jon shook off Pyp ’ s hand <SEP> <BOS> Halder <SEP> enough <SEP> <EOS>
Halder looked to Ser Alliser <SEP>
The Bastard speaks and the peasants tremble <SEP>  the master-at-arms said in that sharp <SEP> cold voice of his <SEP>  I remind you that I am the master-at-arms here <SEP> Lord Snow <SEP>
Jon urged <SEP> ignoring Thorne as best he could <SEP> <BOS> Look at him <SEP> Halder <SEP> There ’ s no honor in beating a fallen foe <SEP> He yielded<SEP> <EOS> He knelt beside the fat boy <SEP>
Halder lowered his sword <SEP>  He yielded <SEP>  he echoed <SEP>
Ser Alliser ’ s onyx eyes were fixed on Jon Snow <SEP>  It would seem our Bastard is in love <SEP>  he said as Jon helped the fat boy to his feet <SEP>  Show me your steel <SEP> Lord Snow <SEP>
Jon drew his longsword <SEP> He dared defy Ser Alliser only to a point <SEP> and he feared he was well beyond it now <SEP>
Thorne smiled <SEP>  The Bastard wishes to defend his lady love <SEP> so we shall make an exercise of it <SEP> Rat <SEP> Pimple <SEP> help our Stone Head here<SEP>  Rast and Albett moved to join Halder <SEP>  Three of you ought to be sufficient to make Lady Piggy squeal <SEP> All you need do is get past the Bastard <SEP>
Jon said to the fat boy <SEP> Ser Alliser had often sent two foes against him <SEP> but never three <SEP> He knew he would likely go to sleep bruised and bloody tonight <SEP> He braced himself for the assault <SEP> <BOS> Stay behind me <SEP> <EOS>
Suddenly Pyp was beside him <SEP>  Three to two will make for better sport <SEP>  the small boy said cheerfully <SEP> He dropped his visor and slid out his sword <SEP> Before Jon could even think to protest <SEP> Grenn had stepped up to make a third <SEP>
The yard had grown deathly quiet <SEP> Jon could feel Ser Alliser ’ s eyes <SEP>  Why are you waiting?  he asked Rast and the others in a voice gone deceptively soft <SEP> but it was Jon who moved first <SEP> Halder barely got his sword up in time <SEP>
Jon drove him backward <SEP> attacking with every blow <SEP> keeping the older boy on the heels <SEP> Know your foe <SEP> Ser Rodrik had taught him once; Jon knew Halder <SEP> brutally strong but short of patience <SEP> with no taste for defense <SEP> Frustrate him <SEP> and he would leave himself open <SEP> as certain as sunset <SEP>
The clang of steel echoed through the yard as the others joined battle around him <SEP> Jon blocked a savage cut at his head <SEP> the shock of impact running up his arm as the swords crashed together <SEP> He slammed a sidestroke into Halder ’ s ribs <SEP> and was rewarded with a muffled grunt of pain <SEP> The counterstroke caught Jon on the shoulder <SEP> Chainmail crunched <SEP> and pain flared up his neck <SEP> but for an instant Halder was unbalanced <SEP> Jon cut his left leg from under him <SEP> and he fell with a curse and a crash <SEP>
Grenn was standing his ground as Jon had taught him <SEP> giving Albett more than he cared for <SEP> but Pyp was hard-pressed <SEP> Rast had two years and forty pounds on him <SEP> Jon stepped up behind him and rang the raper ’ s helm like a bell <SEP> As Rast went reeling <SEP> Pyp slid in under his guard <SEP> knocked him down <SEP> and leveled a blade at his throat <SEP> By then Jon had moved on <SEP> Facing two swords <SEP> Albett backed away <SEP>  I yield <SEP>  he shouted <SEP>
Ser Alliser Thorne surveyed the scene with disgust <SEP>  The mummer ’ s farce has gone on long enough for today<SEP>  He walked away <SEP> The session was at an end <SEP>
Dareon helped Halder to his feet <SEP> The quarryman ’ s son wrenched off his helm and threw it across the yard <SEP>  For an instant <SEP> I thought I finally had you <SEP> Snow <SEP>
Jon replied <SEP> Under his mail and leather <SEP> his shoulder was throbbing <SEP> He sheathed his sword and tried to remove his helm <SEP> but when he raised his arm <SEP> the pain made him grit his teeth <SEP> <BOS> For an instant <SEP> you did <SEP> <EOS>
Let me <SEP>  a voice said <SEP> Thick-fingered hands unfastened helm from gorget and lifted it off gently <SEP>  Did he hurt you?
I ’ ve been bruised before<SEP>  He touched his shoulder and winced <SEP> The yard was emptying around them <SEP>
Blood matted the fat boy ’ s hair where Halder had split his helm asunder <SEP>  My name is Samwell Tarly <SEP> of Horn …  He stopped and licked his lips <SEP>  I mean <SEP> I was of Horn Hill <SEP> until I … left <SEP> I ’ ve come to take the black <SEP> My father is Lord Randyll <SEP> a bannerman to the Tyrells of Highgarden <SEP> I used to be his heir <SEP> only …  His voice trailed off <SEP>
I ’ m Jon Snow <SEP> Ned Stark ’ s bastard <SEP> of Winterfell <SEP>
Samwell Tarly nodded <SEP>  I … if you want <SEP> you can call me Sam <SEP> My mother calls me Sam <SEP>
You can call him Lord Snow <SEP>  Pyp said as he came up to join them <SEP>  You don ’ t want to know what his mother calls him <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> <BOS> These two are Grenn and Pypar <SEP> <EOS>
Grenn ’ s the ugly one <SEP>  Pyp said <SEP>
Grenn scowled <SEP>  You ’ re uglier than me <SEP> At least I don ’ t have ears like a bat <SEP>
My thanks to all of you <SEP>  the fat boy said gravely <SEP>
Why didn ’ t you get up and fight?  Grenn demanded <SEP>
I wanted to <SEP> truly <SEP> I just … I couldn ’ t <SEP> I didn ’ t want him to hit me anymore<SEP>  He looked at the ground <SEP>  I … I fear I ’ m a coward <SEP> My lord father always said so <SEP>
Grenn looked thunderstruck <SEP> Even Pyp had no words to say to that <SEP> and Pyp had words for everything <SEP> What sort of man would proclaim himself a coward?
Samwell Tarly must have read their thoughts on their faces <SEP> His eyes met Jon ’ s and darted away <SEP> quick as frightened animals <SEP>  I … I ’ m sorry <SEP>  he said <SEP>  I don ’ t mean to … to be like I am<SEP>  He walked heavily toward the armory <SEP>
Jon called after him <SEP>  You were hurt <SEP>  he said <SEP>  Tomorrow you ’ ll do better <SEP>
Sam looked mournfully back over one shoulder <SEP>  No I won ’ t <SEP>  he said <SEP> blinking back tears <SEP>  I never do better <SEP>
When he was gone <SEP> Grenn frowned <SEP>  Nobody likes cravens <SEP>  he said uncomfortably <SEP>  I wish we hadn ’ t helped him <SEP> What if they think we ’ re craven too?
You ’ re too stupid to be craven <SEP>  Pyp told him <SEP>
I am not <SEP>  Grenn said <SEP>
Yes you are <SEP> If a bear attacked you in the woods <SEP> you ’ d be too stupid to run away <SEP>
I would not <SEP>  Grenn insisted <SEP>  I ’ d run away faster than you<SEP>  He stopped suddenly <SEP> scowling when he saw Pyp ’ s grin and realized what he ’ d just said <SEP> His thick neck flushed a dark red <SEP> Jon left them there arguing as he returned to the armory <SEP> hung up his sword <SEP> and stripped off his battered armor <SEP>
Life at Castle Black followed certain patterns; the mornings were for swordplay <SEP> the afternoons for work <SEP> The black brothers set new recruits to many different tasks <SEP> to learn where their skills lay <SEP> Jon cherished the rare afternoons when he was sent out with Ghost ranging at his side to bring back game for the Lord Commander ’ s table <SEP> but for every day spent hunting <SEP> he gave a dozen to Donal Noye in the armory <SEP> spinning the whetstone while the one-armed smith sharpened axes grown dull from use <SEP> or pumping the bellows as Noye hammered out a new sword <SEP> Other times he ran messages <SEP> stood at guard <SEP> mucked out stables <SEP> fletched arrows <SEP> assisted Maester Aemon with his birds or Bowen Marsh with his counts and inventories <SEP>
That afternoon <SEP> the watch commander sent him to the winch cage with four barrels of fresh-crushed stone <SEP> to scatter gravel over the icy footpaths atop the Wall <SEP> It was lonely and boring work <SEP> even with Ghost along for company <SEP> but Jon found he did not mind <SEP> On a clear day you could see half the world from the top of the Wall <SEP> and the air was always cold and bracing <SEP> He could think here <SEP> and he found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly … and <SEP> oddly <SEP> of Tyrion Lannister <SEP> He wondered what Tyrion would have made of the fat boy <SEP> Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it <SEP> the dwarf had told him <SEP> grinning <SEP> The world was full of cravens who pretended to be heroes; it took a queer sort of courage to admit to cowardice as Samwell Tarly had <SEP>
His sore shoulder made the work go slowly <SEP> It was late afternoon before Jon finished graveling the paths <SEP> He lingered on high to watch the sun go down <SEP> turning the western sky the color of blood <SEP> Finally <SEP> as dusk was settling over the north <SEP> Jon rolled the empty barrels back into the cage and signaled the winch men to lower him <SEP>
The evening meal was almost done by the time he and Ghost reached the common hall <SEP> A group of the black brothers were dicing over mulled wine near the fire <SEP> His friends were at the bench nearest the west wall <SEP> laughing <SEP> Pyp was in the middle of a story <SEP> The mummer ’ s boy with the big ears was a born liar with a hundred different voices <SEP> and he did not tell his tales so much as live them <SEP> playing all the parts as needed <SEP> a king one moment and a swineherd the next <SEP> When he turned into an alehouse girl or a virgin princess <SEP> he used a high falsetto voice that reduced them all to tears of helpless laughter <SEP> and his eunuchs were always eerily accurate caricatures of Ser Alliser <SEP> Jon took as much pleasure from Pyp ’ s antics as anyone … yet that night he turned away and went instead to the end of the bench <SEP> where Samwell Tarly sat alone <SEP> as far from the others as he could get <SEP>
He was finishing the last of the pork pie the cooks had served up for supper when Jon sat down across from him <SEP> The fat boy ’ s eyes widened at the sight of Ghost <SEP>  Is that a wolf?
Jon said <SEP> <BOS> A direwolf <SEP> His name is Ghost <SEP> The direwolf is the sigil of my father ’ s House <SEP> <EOS>
Ours is a striding huntsman <SEP>  Samwell Tarly said <SEP>
Do you like to hunt?
The fat boy shuddered <SEP>  I hate it<SEP>  He looked as though he was going to cry again <SEP>
Jon asked him <SEP> <BOS> What ’ s wrong now? Why are you always so frightened? <EOS>
Sam stared at the last of his pork pie and gave a feeble shake of his head <SEP> too scared even to talk <SEP> A burst of laughter filled the hall <SEP> Jon heard Pyp squeaking in a high voice <SEP> He stood <SEP>  Let ’ s go outside <SEP>
The round fat face looked up at him <SEP> suspicious <SEP>  Why? What will we do outside?
Jon said <SEP> <BOS> Talk <SEP> Have you seen the Wall? <EOS>
I ’ m fat <SEP> not blind <SEP>  Samwell Tarly said <SEP>  Of course I saw it <SEP> it ’ s seven hundred feet high<SEP>  Yet he stood up all the same <SEP> wrapped a fur-lined cloak over his shoulders <SEP> and followed Jon from the common hall <SEP> still wary <SEP> as if he suspected some cruel trick was waiting for him in the night <SEP> Ghost padded along beside them <SEP>  I never thought it would be like this <SEP>  Sam said as they walked <SEP> his words steaming in the cold air <SEP> Already he was huffing and puffing as he tried to keep up <SEP>  All the buildings are falling down <SEP> and it ’ s so … so …
Cold?  A hard frost was settling over the castle <SEP> and Jon could hear the soft crunch of grey weeds beneath his boots <SEP>
Sam nodded miserably <SEP>  I hate the cold <SEP>  he said <SEP>  Last night I woke up in the dark and the fire had gone out and I was certain I was going to freeze to death by morning <SEP>
It must have been warmer where you come from <SEP>
I never saw snow until last month <SEP> We were crossing the barrowlands <SEP> me and the men my father sent to see me north <SEP> and this white stuff began to fall <SEP> like a soft rain <SEP> At first I thought it was so beautiful <SEP> like feathers drifting from the sky <SEP> but it kept on and on <SEP> until I was frozen to the bone <SEP> The men had crusts of snow in their beards and more on their shoulders <SEP> and still it kept coming <SEP> I was afraid it would never end <SEP>
Jon smiled <SEP>
The Wall loomed before them <SEP> glimmering palely in the light of the half moon <SEP> In the sky above <SEP> the stars burned clear and sharp <SEP>  Are they going to make me go up there?  Sam asked <SEP> His face curdled like old milk as he looked at the great wooden stairs <SEP>  I ’ ll die if I have to climb that <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> pointing <SEP> <BOS> There ’ s a winch <SEP> They can draw you up in a cage <SEP> <EOS>
Samwell Tarly sniffled <SEP>  I don ’ t like high places <SEP>
It was too much <SEP> Jon frowned <SEP> incredulous <SEP>  Are you afraid of everything?  he asked <SEP>  I don ’ t understand <SEP> If you are truly so craven <SEP> why are you here? Why would a coward want to join the Night ’ s Watch?
Samwell Tarly looked at him for a long moment <SEP> and his round face seemed to cave in on itself <SEP> He sat down on the frost-covered ground and began to cry <SEP> huge choking sobs that made his whole body shake <SEP> Jon Snow could only stand and watch <SEP> Like the snowfall on the barrowlands <SEP> it seemed the tears would never end <SEP>
It was Ghost who knew what to do <SEP> Silent as shadow <SEP> the pale direwolf moved closer and began to lick the warm tears off Samwell Tarly ’ s face <SEP> The fat boy cried out <SEP> startled … and somehow <SEP> in a heartbeat <SEP> his sobs turned to laughter <SEP>
Jon Snow laughed with him <SEP> Afterward they sat on the frozen ground <SEP> huddled in their cloaks with Ghost between them <SEP> Jon told the story of how he and Robb had found the pups newborn in the late summer snows <SEP> It seemed a thousand years ago now <SEP> Before long he found himself talking of Winterfell <SEP>
Sometimes I dream about it <SEP>  he said <SEP>  I ’ m walking down this long empty hall <SEP> My voice echoes all around <SEP> but no one answers <SEP> so I walk faster <SEP> opening doors <SEP> shouting names <SEP> I don ’ t even know who I ’ m looking for <SEP> Most nights it ’ s my father <SEP> but sometimes it ’ s Robb instead <SEP> or my little sister Arya <SEP> or my uncle<SEP>  The thought of Benjen Stark saddened him; his uncle was still missing <SEP> The Old Bear had sent out rangers in search of him <SEP> Ser Jaremy Rykker had led two sweeps <SEP> and Quorin Halfhand had gone forth from the Shadow Tower <SEP> but they ’ d found nothing aside from a few blazes in the trees that his uncle had left to mark his way <SEP> In the stony highlands to the northwest <SEP> the marks stopped abruptly and all trace of Ben Stark vanished <SEP>
Do you ever find anyone in your dream?  Sam asked <SEP>
Jon shook his head <SEP>  No one <SEP> The castle is always empty<SEP>  He had never told anyone of the dream <SEP> and he did not understand why he was telling Sam now <SEP> yet somehow it felt good to talk of it <SEP>  Even the ravens are gone from the rookery <SEP> and the stables are full of bones <SEP> That always scares me <SEP> I start to run then <SEP> throwing open doors <SEP> climbing the tower three steps at a time <SEP> screaming for someone <SEP> for anyone <SEP> And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts <SEP> It ’ s black inside <SEP> and I can see the steps spiraling down <SEP> Somehow I know I have to go down there <SEP> but I don ’ t want to <SEP> I ’ m afraid of what might be waiting for me <SEP> The old Kings of Winter are down there <SEP> sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps <SEP> but it ’ s not them I ’ m afraid of <SEP> I scream that I ’ m not a Stark <SEP> that this isn ’ t my place <SEP> but it ’ s no good <SEP> I have to go anyway <SEP> so I start down <SEP> feeling the walls as I descend <SEP> with no torch to light the way <SEP> It gets darker and darker <SEP> until I want to scream<SEP>  He stopped <SEP> frowning <SEP> embarrassed <SEP>  That ’ s when I always wake<SEP>  His skin cold and clammy <SEP> shivering in the darkness of his cell <SEP> Ghost would leap up beside him <SEP> his warmth as comforting as daybreak <SEP> He would go back to sleep with his face pressed into the direwolf ’ s shaggy white fur <SEP>  Do you dream of Horn Hill?  Jon asked <SEP>
No<SEP>  Sam ’ s mouth grew tight and hard <SEP>  I hated it there<SEP>  He scratched Ghost behind the ear <SEP> brooding <SEP> and Jon let the silence breathe <SEP> After a long while Samwell Tarly began to talk <SEP> and Jon Snow listened quietly <SEP> and learned how it was that a self-confessed coward found himself on the Wall <SEP>
The Tarlys were a family old in honor <SEP> bannermen to Mace Tyrell <SEP> Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South <SEP> The eldest son of Lord Randyll Tarly <SEP> Samwell was born heir to rich lands <SEP> a strong keep <SEP> and a storied two-handed greatsword named Heartsbane <SEP> forged of Valyrian steel and passed down from father to son near five hundred years <SEP>
Whatever pride his lord father might have felt at Samwell ’ s birth vanished as the boy grew up plump <SEP> soft <SEP> and awkward <SEP> Sam loved to listen to music and make his own songs <SEP> to wear soft velvets <SEP> to play in the castle kitchen beside the cooks <SEP> drinking in the rich smells as he snitched lemon cakes and blueberry tarts <SEP> His passions were books and kittens and dancing <SEP> clumsy as he was <SEP> But he grew ill at the sight of blood <SEP> and wept to see even a chicken slaughtered <SEP> A dozen masters-at-arms came and went at Horn Hill <SEP> trying to turn Samwell into the knight his father wanted <SEP> The boy was cursed and caned <SEP> slapped and starved <SEP> One man had him sleep in his chainmail to make him more martial <SEP> Another dressed him in his mother ’ s clothing and paraded him through the bailey to shame him into valor <SEP> He only grew fatter and more frightened <SEP> until Lord Randyll ’ s disappointment turned to anger and then to loathing <SEP>  One time <SEP>  Sam confided <SEP> his voice dropping from a whisper <SEP>  two men came to the castle <SEP> warlocks from Qarth with white skin and blue lips <SEP> They slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood <SEP> but it didn ’ t make me brave as they ’ d promised <SEP> I got sick and retched <SEP> Father had them scourged <SEP>
Finally <SEP> after three girls in as many years <SEP> Lady Tarly gave her lord husband a second son <SEP> From that day <SEP> Lord Randyll ignored Sam <SEP> devoting all his time to the younger boy <SEP> a fierce <SEP> robust child more to his liking <SEP> Samwell had known several years of sweet peace with his music and his books <SEP>
Until the dawn of his fifteenth name day <SEP> when he had been awakened to find his horse saddled and ready <SEP> Three men-at-arms had escorted him into a wood near Horn Hill <SEP> where his father was skinning a deer <SEP>  You are almost a man grown now <SEP> and my heir <SEP>  Lord Randyll Tarly had told his eldest son <SEP> his long knife laying bare the carcass as he spoke <SEP>  You have given me no cause to disown you <SEP> but neither will I allow you to inherit the land and title that should be Dickon ’ s <SEP> Heartsbane must go to a man strong enough to wield her <SEP> and you are not worthy to touch her hilt <SEP> So I have decided that you shall this day announce that you wish to take the black <SEP> You will forsake all claim to your brother ’ s inheritance and start north before evenfall <SEP>
If you do not <SEP> then on the morrow we shall have a hunt <SEP> and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble <SEP> and you will be thrown from the saddle to die … or so I will tell your mother <SEP> She has a woman ’ s heart and finds it in her to cherish even you <SEP> and I have no wish to cause her pain <SEP> Please do not imagine that it will truly be that easy <SEP> should you think to defy me <SEP> Nothing would please me more than to hunt you down like the pig you are<SEP>  His arms were red to the elbow as he laid the skinning knife aside <SEP>  So <SEP> There is your choice <SEP> The Night ’ s Watch  —he reached inside the deer <SEP> ripped out its heart <SEP> and held it in his fist <SEP> red and dripping—  or this <SEP>
Sam told the tale in a calm <SEP> dead voice <SEP> as if it were something that had happened to someone else <SEP> not to him <SEP> And strangely <SEP> Jon thought <SEP> he did not weep <SEP> not even once <SEP> When he was done <SEP> they sat together and listened to the wind for a time <SEP> There was no other sound in all the world <SEP>
Finally Jon said <SEP>  We should go back to the common hall <SEP>
Why?  Sam asked <SEP>
Jon shrugged <SEP> <BOS> There ’ s hot cider to drink <SEP> or mulled wine if you prefer <SEP> Some nights Dareon sings for us <SEP> if the mood is on him <SEP> He was a singer <SEP> before … well <SEP> not truly <SEP> but almost <SEP> an apprentice singer <SEP> <EOS>
How did he come here?  Sam asked <SEP>
Jon smiled <SEP> <BOS> Lord Rowan of Goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter <SEP> The girl was two years older <SEP> and Dareon swears she helped him through her window <SEP> but under her father ’ s eye she named it rape <SEP> so here he is <SEP> When Maester Aemon heard him sing <SEP> he said his voice was honey poured over thunder<SEP> Toad sometimes sings too <SEP> if you call it singing <SEP> Drinking songs he learned in his father ’ s winesink <SEP> Pyp says his voice is piss poured over a fart<SEP> <EOS> They laughed at that together <SEP>
I should like to hear them both <SEP>  Sam admitted <SEP>  but they would not want me there<SEP>  His face was troubled <SEP>  He ’ s going to make me fight again on the morrow <SEP> isn ’ t he?
He is <SEP>  Jon was forced to say <SEP>
Sam got awkwardly to his feet <SEP>  I had better try to sleep <SEP>  He huddled down in his cloak and plodded off <SEP>
The others were still in the common room when Jon returned <SEP> alone but for Ghost <SEP>  Where have you been?  Pyp asked <SEP>
Talking with Sam <SEP>  he said <SEP>
He truly is craven <SEP>  said Grenn <SEP>  At supper <SEP> there were still places on the bench when he got his pie <SEP> but he was too scared to come sit with us <SEP>
The Lord of Ham thinks he ’ s too good to eat with the likes of us <SEP>  suggested Jeren <SEP>
I saw him eat a pork pie <SEP>  Toad said <SEP> smirking <SEP>  Do you think it was a brother?  He began to make oinking noises <SEP>
Jon snapped angrily <SEP> <BOS> Stop it! <EOS>
The other boys fell silent <SEP> taken aback by his sudden fury <SEP> Jon said into the quiet <SEP> and he told them how it was going to be <SEP> Pyp backed him <SEP> as he ’ d known he would <SEP> but when Halder spoke up <SEP> it was a pleasant surprise <SEP> Grenn was anxious at the first <SEP> but Jon knew the words to move him <SEP> One by one the rest fell in line <SEP> Jon persuaded some <SEP> cajoled some <SEP> shamed the others <SEP> made threats where threats were required <SEP> At the end they had all agreed … all but Rast <SEP> <BOS> Listen to me <SEP> <EOS>
You girls do as you please <SEP>  Rast said <SEP>  but if Thorne sends me against Lady Piggy <SEP> I ’ m going to slice me off a rasher of bacon<SEP>  He laughed in Jon ’ s face and left them there <SEP>
Hours later <SEP> as the castle slept <SEP> three of them paid a call on his cell <SEP> Grenn held his arms while Pyp sat on his legs <SEP> Jon could hear Rast ’ s rapid breathing as Ghost leapt onto his chest <SEP> The direwolf ’ s eyes burned red as embers as his teeth nipped lightly at the soft skin of the boy ’ s throat <SEP> just enough to draw blood <SEP> Jon said softly <SEP> <BOS> Remember <SEP> we know where you sleep <SEP> <EOS>
The next morning Jon heard Rast tell Albett and Toad how his razor had slipped while he shaved <SEP>
From that day forth <SEP> neither Rast nor any of the others would hurt Samwell Tarly <SEP> When Ser Alliser matched them against him <SEP> they would stand their ground and swat aside his slow <SEP> clumsy strokes <SEP> If the master-at-arms screamed for an attack <SEP> they would dance in and tap Sam lightly on breastplate or helm or leg <SEP> Ser Alliser raged and threatened and called them all cravens and women and worse <SEP> yet Sam remained unhurt <SEP> A few nights later <SEP> at Jon ’ s urging <SEP> he joined them for the evening meal <SEP> taking a place on the bench beside Halder <SEP> It was another fortnight before he found the nerve to join their talk <SEP> but in time he was laughing at Pyp ’ s faces and teasing Grenn with the best of them <SEP>
Fat and awkward and frightened he might be <SEP> but Samwell Tarly was no fool <SEP> One night he visited Jon in his cell <SEP>  I don ’ t know what you did <SEP>  he said <SEP>  but I know you did it<SEP>  He looked away shyly <SEP>  I ’ ve never had a friend before <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> He put a hand on Sam ’ s broad shoulder <SEP> <BOS> We ’ re not friends <SEP> We ’ re brothers <SEP> <EOS>
And so they were <SEP> he thought to himself after Sam had taken his leave <SEP> Robb and Bran and Rickon were his father ’ s sons <SEP> and he loved them still <SEP> yet Jon knew that he had never truly been one of them <SEP> Catelyn Stark had seen to that <SEP> The grey walls of Winterfell might still haunt his dreams <SEP> but Castle Black was his life now <SEP> and his brothers were Sam and Grenn and Halder and Pyp and the other cast-outs who wore the black of the Night ’ s Watch <SEP>
My uncle spoke truly <SEP>  he whispered to Ghost <SEP> He wondered if he would ever see Benjen Stark again <SEP> to tell him <SEP>
You are as hopeless as any boys I have ever trained <SEP>  Ser Alliser Thorne announced when they had all assembled in the yard <SEP>  Your hands were made for manure shovels <SEP> not for swords <SEP> and if it were up to me <SEP> the lot of you would be set to herding swine <SEP> But last night I was told that Gueren is marching five new boys up the kingsroad <SEP> One or two may even be worth the price of piss <SEP> To make room for them <SEP> I have decided to pass eight of you on to the Lord Commander to do with as he will<SEP>  He called out the names one by one <SEP>  Toad <SEP> Stone Head <SEP> Aurochs <SEP> Lover <SEP> Pimple <SEP> Monkey <SEP> Ser Loon<SEP>  Last <SEP> he looked at Jon <SEP>  And the Bastard <SEP>
Pyp let fly a whoop and thrust his sword into the air <SEP> Ser Alliser fixed him with a reptile stare <SEP>  They will call you men of Night ’ s Watch now <SEP> but you are bigger fools than the Mummer ’ s Monkey here if you believe that <SEP> You are boys still <SEP> green and stinking of summer <SEP> and when the winter comes you will die like flies<SEP>  And with that <SEP> Ser Alliser Thorne took his leave of them <SEP>
The other boys gathered round the eight who had been named <SEP> laughing and cursing and offering congratulations <SEP> Halder smacked Toad on the butt with the flat of his sword and shouted <SEP>  Toad <SEP> of the Night ’ s Watch!  Yelling that a black brother needed a horse <SEP> Pyp leapt onto Grenn ’ s shoulders <SEP> and they tumbled to the ground <SEP> rolling and punching and hooting <SEP> Dareon dashed inside the armory and returned with a skin of sour red <SEP> As they passed the wine from hand to hand <SEP> grinning like fools <SEP> Jon noticed Samwell Tarly standing by himself beneath a bare dead tree in the corner of the yard <SEP> Jon offered him the skin <SEP>  A swallow of wine?
Sam shook his head <SEP>  No thank you <SEP> Jon <SEP>
Are you well?
Very well <SEP> truly <SEP>  the fat boy lied <SEP>  I am so happy for you all<SEP>  His round face quivered as he forced a smile <SEP>  You will be First Ranger someday <SEP> just as your uncle was <SEP>
Jon corrected <SEP> He would not accept that Benjen Stark was dead <SEP> Before he could say more <SEP> Halder cried <SEP> <BOS> Is <SEP> Here <SEP> you planning to drink that all yourself? <EOS> Pyp snatched the skin from his hand and danced away <SEP> laughing <SEP> While Grenn seized his arm <SEP> Pyp gave the skin a squeeze <SEP> and a thin stream of red squirted Jon in the face <SEP> Halder howled in protest at the waste of good wine <SEP> Jon sputtered and struggled <SEP> Matthar and Jeren climbed the wall and began pelting them all with snowballs <SEP>
By the time he wrenched free <SEP> with snow in his hair and wine stains on his surcoat <SEP> Samwell Tarly had gone <SEP>
That night <SEP> Three-Finger Hobb cooked the boys a special meal to mark the occasion <SEP> When Jon arrived at the common hall <SEP> the Lord Steward himself led him to the bench near the fire <SEP> The older men clapped him on the arm in passing <SEP> The eight soon-to-be brothers feasted on rack of lamb baked in a crust of garlic and herbs <SEP> garnished with sprigs of mint <SEP> and surrounded by mashed yellow turnips swimming in butter <SEP>  From the Lord Commander ’ s own table <SEP>  Bowen Marsh told them <SEP> There were salads of spinach and chickpeas and turnip greens <SEP> and afterward bowls of iced blueberries and sweet cream <SEP>
Do you think they ’ ll keep us together?  Pyp wondered as they gorged themselves happily <SEP>
Toad made a face <SEP>  I hope not <SEP> I ’ m sick of looking at those ears of yours <SEP>
Ho <SEP>  said Pyp <SEP>  Listen to the crow call the raven black <SEP> You ’ re certain to be a ranger <SEP> Toad <SEP> They ’ ll want you as far from the castle as they can <SEP> If Mance Rayder attacks <SEP> lift your visor and show your face <SEP> and he ’ ll run off screaming <SEP>
Everyone laughed but Grenn <SEP>  I hope I ’ m a ranger <SEP>
You and everyone else <SEP>  said Matthar <SEP> Every man who wore the black walked the Wall <SEP> and every man was expected to take up steel in its defense <SEP> but the rangers were the true fighting heart of the Night ’ s Watch <SEP> It was they who dared ride beyond the Wall <SEP> sweeping through the haunted forest and the icy mountain heights west of the Shadow Tower <SEP> fighting Wildlings and giants and monstrous snow bears <SEP>
Not everyone <SEP>  said Halder <SEP>  It ’ s the builders for me <SEP> What use would rangers be if the Wall fell down?
The order of builders provided the masons and carpenters to repair keeps and towers <SEP> the miners to dig tunnels and crush stone for roads and footpaths <SEP> the woodsmen to clear away new growth wherever the forest pressed too close to the Wall <SEP> Once <SEP> it was said <SEP> they had quarried immense blocks of ice from frozen lakes deep in the haunted forest <SEP> dragging them south on sledges so the Wall might be raised ever higher <SEP> Those days were centuries gone <SEP> however; now <SEP> it was all they could do to ride the Wall from Eastwatch to the Shadow Tower <SEP> watching for cracks or signs of melt and making what repairs they could <SEP>
The Old Bear ’ s no fool <SEP>  Dareon observed <SEP>  You ’ re certain to be a builder <SEP> and Jon ’ s certain to be a ranger <SEP> He ’ s the best sword and the best rider among us <SEP> and his uncle was the First before he …  His voice trailed off awkwardly as he realized what he had almost said <SEP>
Benjen Stark is still First Ranger <SEP>  Jon Snow told him <SEP> toying with his bowl of blueberries <SEP> The rest might have given up all hope of his uncle ’ s safe return <SEP> but not him <SEP> He pushed away the berries <SEP> scarcely touched <SEP> and rose from the bench <SEP>
Aren ’ t you going to eat those?  Toad asked <SEP>
They ’ re yours<SEP>  Jon had hardly tasted Hobb ’ s great feast <SEP>  I could not eat another bite<SEP>  He took his cloak from its hook near the door and shouldered his way out <SEP>
Pyp followed him <SEP>  Jon <SEP> what is it?
Sam <SEP>  he admitted <SEP>  He was not at table tonight <SEP>
It ’ s not like him to miss a meal <SEP>  Pyp said thoughtfully <SEP>  Do you suppose he ’ s taken ill?
He ’ s frightened <SEP> We ’ re leaving him<SEP>  He remembered the day he had left Winterfell <SEP> all the bittersweet farewells; Bran lying broken <SEP> Robb with snow in his hair <SEP> Arya raining kisses on him after he ’ d given her Needle <SEP>  Once we say our words <SEP> we ’ ll all have duties to attend to <SEP> Some of us may be sent away <SEP> to Eastwatch or the Shadow Tower <SEP> Sam will remain in training <SEP> with the likes of Rast and Cuger and these new boys who are coming up the kingsroad <SEP> Gods only know what they ’ ll be like <SEP> but you can bet Ser Alliser will send them against him <SEP> first chance he gets <SEP>
Pyp made a grimace <SEP>  You did all you could <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> <BOS> All we could wasn ’ t enough <SEP> <EOS>
A deep restlessness was on him as he went back to Hardin ’ s Tower for Ghost <SEP> The direwolf walked beside him to the stables <SEP> Some of the more skittish horses kicked at their stalls and laid back their ears as they entered <SEP> Jon saddled his mare <SEP> mounted <SEP> and rode out from Castle Black <SEP> south across the moonlit night <SEP> Ghost raced ahead of him <SEP> flying over the ground <SEP> gone in the blink of an eye <SEP> Jon let him go <SEP> A wolf needed to hunt <SEP>
He had no destination in mind <SEP> He wanted only to ride <SEP> He followed the creek for a time <SEP> listening to the icy trickle of water over rock <SEP> then cut across the fields to the kingsroad <SEP> It stretched out before him <SEP> narrow and stony and pocked with weeds <SEP> a road of no particular promise <SEP> yet the sight of it filled Jon Snow with a vast longing <SEP> Winterfell was down that road <SEP> and beyond it Riverrun and King ’ s Landing and the Eyrie and so many other places; Casterly Rock <SEP> the Isles of Faces <SEP> the red mountains of Dorne <SEP> the hundred islands of Braavos in the sea <SEP> the smoking ruins of old Valyria <SEP> All the places that Jon would never see <SEP> The world was down that road … and he was here <SEP>
Once he swore his vow <SEP> the Wall would be his home until he was old as Maester Aemon <SEP>  I have not sworn yet <SEP>  he muttered <SEP> He was no outlaw <SEP> bound to take the black or pay the penalty for his crimes <SEP> He had come here freely <SEP> and he might leave freely … until he said the words <SEP> He need only ride on <SEP> and he could leave it all behind <SEP> By the time the moon was full again <SEP> he would be back in Winterfell with his brothers <SEP>
Your half brothers <SEP> a voice inside reminded him <SEP> And Lady Stark <SEP> who will not welcome you <SEP> There was no place for him in Winterfell <SEP> no place in King ’ s Landing either <SEP> Even his own mother had not had a place for him <SEP> The thought of her made him sad <SEP> He wondered who she had been <SEP> what she had looked like <SEP> why his father had left her <SEP> Because she was a whore or an adulteress <SEP> fool <SEP> Something dark and dishonorable <SEP> or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her?
Jon Snow turned away from the kingsroad to look behind him <SEP> The fires of Castle Black were hidden behind a hill <SEP> but the Wall was there <SEP> pale beneath the moon <SEP> vast and cold <SEP> running from horizon to horizon <SEP>
He wheeled his horse around and started for home <SEP>
Ghost returned as he crested a rise and saw the distant glow of lamplight from the Lord Commander ’ s Tower <SEP> The direwolf ’ s muzzle was red with blood as he trotted beside the horse <SEP> Jon found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly again on the ride back <SEP> By the time he reached the stables <SEP> he knew what he must do <SEP>
Maester Aemon ’ s apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery <SEP> Aged and frail <SEP> the maester shared his chambers with two of the younger stewards <SEP> who tended to his needs and helped him in his duties <SEP> The brothers joked that he had been given the two ugliest men in the Night ’ s Watch; being blind <SEP> he was spared having to look at them <SEP> Clydas was short <SEP> bald <SEP> and chinless <SEP> with small pink eyes like a mole <SEP> Chett had a wen on his neck the size of a pigeon ’ s egg <SEP> and a face red with boils and pimples <SEP> Perhaps that was why he always seemed so angry <SEP>
It was Chett who answered Jon ’ s knock <SEP> Jon told him <SEP> <BOS> I need to speak to Maester Aemon <SEP> <EOS>
The maester is abed <SEP> as you should be <SEP> Come back on the morrow and maybe he ’ ll see you<SEP>  He began to shut the door <SEP>
Jon jammed it open with his boot <SEP> <BOS> I need to speak to him now <SEP> The morning will be too late <SEP> <EOS>
Chett scowled <SEP>  The maester is not accustomed to being woken in the night <SEP> Do you know how old he is?
Jon said <SEP> <BOS> Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you <SEP> Give him my pardons <SEP> I would not disturb his rest if it were not important <SEP> <EOS>
And if I refuse?
Jon had his boot wedged solidly in the door <SEP> <BOS> I can stand here all night if I must <SEP> <EOS>
The black brother made a disgusted noise and opened the door to admit him <SEP>  Wait in the library <SEP> There ’ s wood <SEP> Start a fire <SEP> I won ’ t have the maester catching a chill on account of you <SEP>
Jon had the logs crackling merrily by the time Chett led in Maester Aemon <SEP> The old man was clad in his bed robe <SEP> but around his throat was the chain collar of his order <SEP> A maester did not remove it even to sleep <SEP> <BOS> The chair beside the fire would be pleasant <SEP> <EOS> he said when he felt the warmth on his face <SEP> When he was settled comfortably <SEP> Chett covered his legs with a fur and went to stand by the door <SEP>
I am sorry to have woken you <SEP> Maester <SEP>  Jon Snow said <SEP>
You did not wake me <SEP>  Maester Aemon replied <SEP>  I find I need less sleep as I grow older <SEP> and I am grown very old <SEP> I often spend half the night with ghosts <SEP> remembering times fifty years past as if they were yesterday <SEP> The mystery of a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion <SEP> So tell me <SEP> Jon Snow <SEP> why have you come calling at this strange hour?
To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night ’ s Watch <SEP>
This is no concern of Maester Aemon <SEP>  Chett complained <SEP>
Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser Alliser Thorne <SEP>  the maester said gently <SEP>  Only he may say when a boy is ready to swear his vow <SEP> as you surely know <SEP> Why then come to me?
Jon told him <SEP> <BOS> The Lord Commander listens to you <SEP> And the wounded and the sick of the Night ’ s Watch are in your charge <SEP> <EOS>
And is your friend Samwell wounded or sick?
Jon promised <SEP> <BOS> He will be <SEP> unless you help <SEP> <EOS>
He told them all of it <SEP> even the part where he ’ d set Ghost at Rast ’ s throat <SEP> Maester Aemon listened silently <SEP> blind eyes fixed on the fire <SEP> but Chett ’ s face darkened with each word <SEP> Jon finished <SEP> <BOS> Without us to keep him safe <SEP> Sam will have no chance <SEP> He ’ s hopeless with a sword <SEP> My sister Arya could tear him apart <SEP> and she ’ s not yet ten <SEP> If Ser Alliser makes him fight <SEP> it ’ s only a matter of time before he ’ s hurt or killed <SEP> <EOS>
Chett could stand no more <SEP>  I ’ ve seen this fat boy in the common hall <SEP>  he said <SEP>  He is a pig <SEP> and a hopeless craven as well <SEP> if what you say is true <SEP>
Maybe it is so <SEP>  Maester Aemon said <SEP>  Tell me <SEP> Chett <SEP> what would you have us do with such a boy?
Leave him where he is <SEP>  Chett said <SEP>  The Wall is no place for the weak <SEP> Let him train until he is ready <SEP> no matter how many years that takes <SEP> Ser Alliser shall make a man of him or kill him <SEP> as the gods will <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> He took a deep breath to gather his thoughts <SEP> <BOS> That ’ s stupid <SEP> I remember once I asked Maester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat <SEP> <EOS>
Maester Aemon touched his own collar lightly <SEP> his bony <SEP> wrinkled finger stroking the heavy metal links <SEP>  Go on <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> remembering <SEP> <BOS> He told me that a maester ’ s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve <SEP> I asked why each link was a different metal <SEP> A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes <SEP> I said <SEP> Maester Luwin laughed <SEP> A maester forges his chain with study <SEP> he told me <SEP> The different metals are each a different kind of learning <SEP> gold for the study of money and accounts <SEP> silver for healing <SEP> iron for warcraft <SEP> And he said there were other meanings as well <SEP> The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves <SEP> isn ’ t that so? Lords are gold and knights steel <SEP> but two links can ’ t make a chain <SEP> You also need silver and iron and lead <SEP> tin and copper and bronze and all the rest <SEP> and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like <SEP> A chain needs all sorts of metals <SEP> and a land needs all sorts of people <SEP> <EOS>
Maester Aemon smiled <SEP>  And so?
The Night ’ s Watch needs all sorts too <SEP> Why else have rangers and stewards and builders? Lord Randyll couldn ’ t make Sam a warrior <SEP> and Ser Alliser won ’ t either <SEP> You can ’ t hammer tin into iron <SEP> no matter how hard you beat it <SEP> but that doesn ’ t mean tin is useless <SEP> Why shouldn ’ t Sam be a steward?
Chett gave an angry scowl <SEP>  I ’ m a steward <SEP> You think it ’ s easy work <SEP> fit for cowards? The order of stewards keeps the Watch alive <SEP> We hunt and farm <SEP> tend the horses <SEP> milk the cows <SEP> gather firewood <SEP> cook the meals <SEP> Who do you think makes your clothing? Who brings up supplies from the south? The stewards <SEP>
Maester Aemon was gentler <SEP>  Is your friend a hunter?
He hates hunting <SEP>  Jon had to admit <SEP>
Can he plow a field?  the maester asked <SEP>  Can he drive a wagon or sail a ship? Could he butcher a cow?
No <SEP>
Chett gave a nasty laugh <SEP>  I ’ ve seen what happens to soft lordlings when they ’ re put to work <SEP> Set them to churning butter and their hands blister and bleed <SEP> Give them an axe to split logs <SEP> and they cut off their own foot <SEP>
I know one thing Sam could do better than anyone <SEP>
Yes?  Maester Aemon prompted <SEP>
Jon glanced warily at Chett <SEP> standing beside the door <SEP> his boils red and angry <SEP>  He could help you <SEP>  he said quickly <SEP>  He can do sums <SEP> and he knows how to read and write <SEP> I know Chett can ’ t read <SEP> and Clydas has weak eyes <SEP> Sam read every book in his father ’ s library <SEP> He ’ d be good with the ravens too <SEP> Animals seem to like him <SEP> Ghost took to him straight off <SEP> There ’ s a lot he could do <SEP> besides fighting <SEP> The Night ’ s Watch needs every man <SEP> Why kill one <SEP> to no end? Make use of him instead <SEP>
Maester Aemon closed his eyes <SEP> and for a brief moment Jon was afraid that he had gone to sleep <SEP> Finally he said <SEP>  Maester Luwin taught you well <SEP> Jon Snow <SEP> Your mind is as deft as your blade <SEP> it would seem <SEP>
Does that mean …?
It means I shall think on what you have said <SEP>  the maester told him firmly <SEP>  And now <SEP> I believe I am ready to sleep <SEP> Chett <SEP> show our young brother to the door <SEP>
Jon was breaking his fast on applecakes and blood sausage when Samwell Tarly plopped himself down on the bench <SEP>  I ’ ve been summoned to the sept <SEP>  Sam said in an excited whisper <SEP>  They ’ re passing me out of training <SEP> I ’ m to be made a brother with the rest of you <SEP> Can you believe it?
No <SEP> truly?
Truly <SEP> I ’ m to assist Maester Aemon with the library and the birds <SEP> He needs someone who can read and write letters <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> smiling <SEP> <BOS> You ’ ll do well at that <SEP> <EOS>
Sam glanced about anxiously <SEP>  Is it time to go? I shouldn ’ t be late <SEP> they might change their minds<SEP>  He was fairly bouncing as they crossed the weed-strewn courtyard <SEP> The day was warm and sunny <SEP> Rivulets of water trickled down the sides of the Wall <SEP> so the ice seemed to sparkle and shine <SEP>
Inside the sept <SEP> the great crystal caught the morning light as it streamed through the south-facing window and spread it in a rainbow on the altar <SEP> Pyp ’ s mouth dropped open when he caught sight of Sam <SEP> and Toad poked Grenn in the ribs <SEP> but no one dared say a word <SEP> Septon Celladar was swinging a censer <SEP> filling the air with fragrant incense that reminded Jon of Lady Stark ’ s little sept in Winterfell <SEP> For once the septon seemed sober <SEP>
The high officers arrived in a body; Maester Aemon leaning on Clydas <SEP> Ser Alliser cold-eyed and grim <SEP> Lord Commander Mormont resplendent in a black wool doublet with silvered bearclaw fastenings <SEP> Behind them came the senior members of the three orders: red-faced Bowen Marsh the Lord Steward <SEP> First Builder Othell Yarwyck <SEP> and Ser Jaremy Rykker <SEP> who commanded the rangers in the absence of Benjen Stark <SEP>
Mormont stood before the altar <SEP> the rainbow shining on his broad bald head <SEP>  You came to us outlaws <SEP>  he began <SEP>  poachers <SEP> rapers <SEP> debtors <SEP> killers <SEP> and thieves <SEP> You came to us children <SEP> You came to us alone <SEP> in chains <SEP> with neither friends nor honor <SEP> You came to us rich <SEP> and you came to us poor <SEP> Some of you bear the names of proud houses <SEP> Others have only bastards ’ names <SEP> or no names at all <SEP> It makes no matter <SEP> All that is past now <SEP> On the Wall <SEP> we are all one house <SEP>
At evenfall <SEP> as the sun sets and we face the gathering night <SEP> you shall take your vows <SEP> From that moment <SEP> you will be a Sworn Brother of the Night ’ s Watch <SEP> Your crimes will be washed away <SEP> your debts forgiven <SEP> So too you must wash away your former loyalties <SEP> put aside your grudges <SEP> forget old wrongs and old loves alike <SEP> Here you begin anew <SEP>
A man of the Night ’ s Watch lives his life for the realm <SEP> Not for a king <SEP> nor a lord <SEP> nor the honor of this house or that house <SEP> neither for gold nor glory nor a woman ’ s love <SEP> but for the realm <SEP> and all the people in it <SEP> A man of the Night ’ s Watch takes no wife and fathers no sons <SEP> Our wife is duty <SEP> Our mistress is honor <SEP> And you are the only sons we shall ever know <SEP>
You have learned the words of the vow <SEP> Think carefully before you say them <SEP> for once you have taken the black <SEP> there is no turning back <SEP> The penalty for desertion is death<SEP>  The Old Bear paused for a moment before he said <SEP>  Are there any among you who wish to leave our company? If so <SEP> go now <SEP> and no one shall think the less of you <SEP>
No one moved <SEP>
Well and good <SEP>  said Mormont <SEP>  You may take your vows here at evenfall <SEP> before Septon Celladar and the first of your order <SEP> Do any of you keep to the old gods?
Jon stood <SEP> <BOS> I do <SEP> my lord <SEP> <EOS>
I expect you will want to say your words before a heart tree <SEP> as your uncle did <SEP>  Mormont said <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him; the blood of the First Men flowed in the veins of the Starks <SEP> <BOS> Yes <SEP> my lord <SEP> <EOS>
He heard Grenn whispering behind him <SEP>  There ’ s no godswood here <SEP> Is there? I never saw a godswood <SEP>
You wouldn ’ t see a herd of aurochs until they trampled you into the snow <SEP>  Pyp whispered back <SEP>
I would so <SEP>  Grenn insisted <SEP>  I ’ d see them a long way off <SEP>
Mormont himself confirmed Grenn ’ s doubts <SEP>  Castle Black has no need of a godswood <SEP> Beyond the Wall the haunted forest stands as it stood in the Dawn Age <SEP> long before the Andals brought the Seven across the narrow sea <SEP> You will find a grove of weirwoods half a league from this spot <SEP> and mayhap your gods as well <SEP>
My lord<SEP>  The voice made Jon glance back in surprise <SEP> Samwell Tarly was on his feet <SEP> The fat boy wiped his sweaty palms against his tunic <SEP>  Might I … might I go as well? To say my words at this heart tree?
Does House Tarly keep the old gods too?  Mormont asked <SEP>
No <SEP> my lord <SEP>  Sam replied in a thin <SEP> nervous voice <SEP> The high officers frightened him <SEP> Jon knew <SEP> the Old Bear most of all <SEP>  I was named in the light of the Seven at the sept on Horn Hill <SEP> as my father was <SEP> and his father <SEP> and all the Tarlys for a thousand years <SEP>
Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House?  wondered Ser Jaremy Rykker <SEP>
The Night ’ s Watch is my House now <SEP>  Sam said <SEP>  The Seven have never answered my prayers <SEP> Perhaps the old gods will <SEP>
As you wish <SEP> boy <SEP>  Mormont said <SEP> Sam took his seat again <SEP> as did Jon <SEP>  We have placed each of you in an order <SEP> as befits our need and your own strengths and skills<SEP>  Bowen Marsh stepped forward and handed him a paper <SEP> The Lord Commander unrolled it and began to read <SEP>  Halder <SEP> to the builders <SEP>  he began <SEP> Halder gave a stiff nod of approval <SEP>  Grenn <SEP> to the rangers <SEP> Albett <SEP> to the builders <SEP> Pypar <SEP> to the rangers <SEP>  Pyp looked over at Jon and wiggled his ears <SEP>  Samwell <SEP> to the stewards <SEP>  Sam sagged with relief <SEP> mopping at his brow with a scrap of silk <SEP>  Matthar <SEP> to the rangers <SEP> Dareon <SEP> to the stewards <SEP> Todder <SEP> to the rangers <SEP> Jon <SEP> to the stewards <SEP>
The stewards! For a moment Jon could not believe what he had heard <SEP> Mormont must have read it wrong <SEP> He started to rise <SEP> to open his mouth <SEP> to tell them there had been a mistake … and then he saw Ser Alliser studying him <SEP> eyes shiny as two flakes of obsidian <SEP> and he knew <SEP>
The Old Bear rolled up the paper <SEP>  Your firsts will instruct you in your duties <SEP> May all the gods preserve you <SEP> brothers<SEP>  The Lord Commander favored them with a half bow <SEP> and took his leave <SEP> Ser Alliser went with him <SEP> a thin smile on his face <SEP> Jon had never seen the master-at-arms look quite so happy <SEP>
Rangers with me <SEP>  Ser Jaremy Rykker called when they were gone <SEP> Pyp was staring at Jon as he got slowly to his feet <SEP> His ears were red <SEP> Grenn <SEP> grinning broadly <SEP> did not seem to realize that anything was amiss <SEP> Matt and Toad fell in beside them <SEP> and they followed Ser Jaremy from the sept <SEP>
Builders <SEP>  announced lantern-jawed Othell Yarwyck <SEP> Halder and Albett trailed out after him <SEP>
Jon looked around him in sick disbelief <SEP> Maester Aemon ’ s blind eyes were raised toward the light he could not see <SEP> The septon was arranging crystals on the altar <SEP> Only Sam and Dareon remained on the benches; a fat boy <SEP> a singer … and him <SEP>
Lord Steward Bowen Marsh rubbed his plump hands together <SEP>  Samwell <SEP> you will assist Maester Aemon in the rookery and library <SEP> Chett is going to the kennels <SEP> to help with the hounds <SEP> You shall have his cell <SEP> so as to be close to the maester night and day <SEP> I trust you will take good care of him <SEP> He is very old and very precious to us <SEP>
Dareon <SEP> I am told that you sang at many a high lord ’ s table and shared their meat and mead <SEP> We are sending you to Eastwatch <SEP> It may be your palate will be some help to Cotter Pyke when merchant galleys come trading <SEP> We are paying too dear for salt beef and pickled fish <SEP> and the quality of the olive oil we ’ re getting has been frightful <SEP> Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive <SEP> he will keep you busy between ships <SEP>
Marsh turned his smile on Jon <SEP>  Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward <SEP> Jon <SEP> You ’ ll sleep in a cell beneath his chambers <SEP> in the Lord Commander ’ s tower <SEP>
Jon asked sharply <SEP> <BOS> And what will my duties be? Will I serve the Lord Commander ’ s meals <SEP> help him fasten his clothes <SEP> fetch hot water for his bath? <EOS>
Certainly<SEP>  Marsh frowned at Jon ’ s tone <SEP>  And you will run his messages <SEP> keep a fire burning in his chambers <SEP> change his sheets and blankets daily <SEP> and do all else that the Lord Commander might require of you <SEP>
Do you take me for a servant?
No <SEP>  Maester Aemon said <SEP> from the back of the sept<SEP> Clydas helped him stand <SEP>  We took you for a man of Night ’ s Watch … but perhaps we were wrong in that <SEP>
It was all Jon could do to stop himself from walking out <SEP> Was he supposed to churn butter and sew doublets like a girl for the rest of his days?  May I go?  he asked stiffly <SEP>
As you wish <SEP>  Bowen Marsh responded <SEP>
Dareon and Sam left with him <SEP> They descended to the yard in silence <SEP> Outside <SEP> Jon looked up at the Wall shining in the sun <SEP> the melting ice creeping down its side in a hundred thin fingers <SEP> Jon ’ s rage was such that he would have smashed it all in an instant <SEP> and the world be damned <SEP>
Jon <SEP>  Samwell Tarly said excitedly <SEP>  Wait <SEP> Don ’ t you see what they ’ re doing?
Jon turned on him in a fury <SEP> <BOS> I see Ser Alliser ’ s bloody hand <SEP> that ’ s all I see <SEP> He wanted to shame me <SEP> and he has <SEP> <EOS>
Dareon gave him a look <SEP>  The stewards are fine for the likes of you and me <SEP> Sam <SEP> but not for Lord Snow <SEP>
Jon blazed back <SEP> <BOS> I ’ m a better swordsman and a better rider than any of you <SEP> It ’ s not fair <SEP> <EOS>
Fair?  Dareon sneered <SEP>  The girl was waiting for me <SEP> naked as the day she was born <SEP> She pulled me through the window <SEP> and you talk to me of fair?  He walked off <SEP>
There is no shame in being a steward <SEP>  Sam said <SEP>
Do you think I want to spend the rest of my life washing an old man ’ s smallclothes?
The old man is Lord Commander of the Night ’ s Watch <SEP>  Sam reminded him <SEP>  You ’ ll be with him day and night <SEP> Yes <SEP> you ’ ll pour his wine and see that his bed linen is fresh <SEP> but you ’ ll also take his letters <SEP> attend him at meetings <SEP> squire for him in battle <SEP> You ’ ll be as close to him as his shadow <SEP> You ’ ll know everything <SEP> be a part of everything … and the Lord Steward said Mormont asked for you himself!
When I was little <SEP> my father used to insist that I attend him in the audience chamber whenever he held court <SEP> When he rode to Highgarden to bend his knee to Lord Tyrell <SEP> he made me come <SEP> Later <SEP> though <SEP> he started to take Dickon and leave me at home <SEP> and he no longer cared whether I sat through his audiences <SEP> so long as Dickon was there <SEP> He wanted his heir at his side <SEP> don ’ t you see? To watch and listen and learn from all he did <SEP> I ’ ll wager that ’ s why Lord Mormont requested you <SEP> Jon <SEP> What else could it be? He wants to groom you for command!
Jon was taken aback <SEP> It was true <SEP> Lord Eddard had often made Robb part of his councils back at Winterfell <SEP> Could Sam be right? Even a bastard could rise high in the Night ’ s Watch <SEP> they said <SEP> <BOS> I never asked for this <SEP> <EOS> he said stubbornly <SEP>
None of us are here for asking <SEP>  Sam reminded him <SEP>
And suddenly Jon Snow was ashamed <SEP>
Craven or not <SEP> Samwell Tarly had found the courage to accept his fate like a man <SEP> On the Wall <SEP> a man gets only what he earns <SEP> Benjen Stark had said the last night Jon had seen him alive <SEP> You ’ re no ranger <SEP> Jon <SEP> only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you <SEP> He ’ d heard it said that bastards grow up faster than other children; on the Wall <SEP> you grew up or you died <SEP>
Jon let out a deep sigh <SEP> <BOS> You have the right of it <SEP> I was acting the boy <SEP> <EOS>
Then you ’ ll stay and say your words with me?
The old gods will be expecting us<SEP>  He made himself smile <SEP>
They set out late that afternoon <SEP> The Wall had no gates as such <SEP> neither here at Castle Black nor anywhere along its three hundred miles <SEP> They led their horses down a narrow tunnel cut through the ice <SEP> cold dark walls pressing in around them as the passage twisted and turned <SEP> Three times their way was blocked by iron bars <SEP> and they had to stop while Bowen Marsh drew out his keys and unlocked the massive chains that secured them <SEP> Jon could sense the vast weight pressing down on him as he waited behind the Lord Steward <SEP> The air was colder than a tomb <SEP> and more still <SEP> He felt a strange relief when they reemerged into the afternoon light on the north side of the Wall <SEP>
Sam blinked at the sudden glare and looked around apprehensively <SEP>  The Wildlings … they wouldn ’ t … they ’ d never dare come this close to the Wall <SEP> Would they?
Jon climbed into his saddle <SEP> When Bowen Marsh and their ranger escort had mounted <SEP> Jon put two fingers in his mouth and whistled <SEP> Ghost came loping out of the tunnel <SEP> <BOS> They never have<SEP> <EOS>
The Lord Steward ’ s garron whickered and backed away from the direwolf <SEP>  Do you mean to take that beast?
Jon said <SEP> Ghost ’ s head lifted <SEP> He seemed to taste the air <SEP> In the blink of an eye he was off <SEP> racing across the broad <SEP> weed-choked field to vanish in the trees <SEP> <BOS> Yes <SEP> my lord <SEP> <EOS>
Once they had entered the forest <SEP> they were in a different world <SEP> Jon had often hunted with his father and Jory and his brother Robb <SEP> He knew the wolfswood around Winterfell as well as any man <SEP> The haunted forest was much the same <SEP> and yet the feel of it was very different <SEP>
Perhaps it was all in the knowing <SEP> They had ridden past the end of the world; somehow that changed everything <SEP> Every shadow seemed darker <SEP> every sound more ominous <SEP> The trees pressed close and shut out the light of the setting sun <SEP> A thin crust of snow cracked beneath the hooves of their horses <SEP> with a sound like breaking bones <SEP> When the wind set the leaves to rustling <SEP> it was like a chilly finger tracing a path up Jon ’ s spine <SEP> The Wall was at their backs <SEP> and only the gods knew what lay ahead <SEP>
The sun was sinking below the trees when they reached their destination <SEP> a small clearing in the deep of the wood where nine weirwoods grew in a rough circle <SEP> Jon drew in a breath <SEP> and he saw Sam Tarly staring <SEP> Even in the wolfswood <SEP> you never found more than two or three of the white trees growing together; a grove of nine was unheard of <SEP> The forest floor was carpeted with fallen leaves <SEP> bloodred on top <SEP> black rot beneath <SEP> The wide smooth trunks were bone pale <SEP> and nine faces stared inward <SEP> The dried sap that crusted in the eyes was red and hard as ruby <SEP> Bowen Marsh commanded them to leave their horses outside the circle <SEP>  This is a sacred place <SEP> we will not defile it <SEP>
When they entered the grove <SEP> Samwell Tarly turned slowly looking at each face in turn <SEP> No two were quite alike <SEP>  They ’ re watching us <SEP>  he whispered <SEP>  The old gods <SEP>
Yes<SEP>  Jon knelt <SEP> and Sam knelt beside him <SEP>
They said the words together <SEP> as the last light faded in the west and grey day became black night <SEP>
Hear my words <SEP> and bear witness to my vow <SEP>  they recited <SEP> their voices filling the twilit grove <SEP>  Night gathers <SEP> and now my watch begins <SEP> It shall not end until my death <SEP> I shall take no wife <SEP> hold no lands <SEP> father no children <SEP> I shall wear no crowns and win no glory <SEP> I shall live and die at my post <SEP> I am the sword in the darkness <SEP> I am the watcher on the walls <SEP> I am the fire that burns against the cold <SEP> the light that brings the dawn <SEP> the horn that wakes the sleepers <SEP> the shield that guards the realms of men <SEP> I pledge my life and honor to the Night ’ s Watch <SEP> for this night and all the nights to come <SEP>
The woods fell silent <SEP>  You knelt as boys <SEP>  Bowen Marsh intoned solemnly <SEP>  Rise now as men of the Night ’ s Watch <SEP>
Jon held out a hand to pull Sam back to his feet <SEP> The rangers gathered round to offer smiles and congratulations <SEP> all but the gnarled old forester Dywen <SEP>  Best we be starting back <SEP> m ’ lord <SEP>  he said to Bowen Marsh <SEP>  Dark ’ s falling <SEP> and there ’ s something in the smell o ’ the night that I mislike <SEP>
And suddenly Ghost was back <SEP> stalking softly between two weirwoods <SEP> White fur and red eyes <SEP> Jon realized <SEP> disquieted <SEP> Like the trees …
The wolf had something in his jaws <SEP> Something black <SEP>  What ’ s he got there?  asked Bowen Marsh <SEP> frowning <SEP>
To me <SEP> Ghost<SEP>  Jon knelt <SEP>  Bring it here <SEP>
The direwolf trotted to him <SEP> Jon heard Samwell Tarly ’ s sharp intake of breath <SEP>
Gods be good <SEP>  Dywen muttered <SEP>  That ’ s a hand <SEP>
Othor <SEP>  announced Ser Jaremy Rykker <SEP>  beyond a doubt <SEP> And this one was Jafer Flowers<SEP>  He turned the corpse over with his foot <SEP> and the dead white face stared up at the overcast sky with blue <SEP> blue eyes <SEP>  They were Ben Stark ’ s men <SEP> both of them <SEP>
My uncle ’ s men <SEP> Jon thought numbly <SEP> He remembered how he ’ d pleaded to ride with them <SEP> Gods <SEP> I was such a green boy <SEP> If he had taken me <SEP> it might be me lying here …
Jafer ’ s right wrist ended in the ruin of torn flesh and splintered bone left by Ghost ’ s jaws <SEP> His right hand was floating in a jar of vinegar back in Maester Aemon ’ s tower <SEP> His left hand <SEP> still at the end of his arm <SEP> was as black as his cloak <SEP>
Gods have mercy <SEP>  the Old Bear muttered <SEP> He swung down from his garron <SEP> handing his reins to Jon <SEP> The morning was unnaturally warm; beads of sweat dotted the Lord Commander ’ s broad forehead like dew on a melon <SEP> His horse was nervous <SEP> rolling her eyes <SEP> backing away from the dead men as far as her lead would allow <SEP> Jon led her off a few paces <SEP> fighting to keep her from bolting <SEP> The horses did not like the feel of this place <SEP> For that matter <SEP> neither did Jon <SEP>
The dogs liked it least of all <SEP> Ghost had led the party here; the pack of hounds had been useless <SEP> When Bass the kennelmaster had tried to get them to take the scent from the severed hand <SEP> they had gone wild <SEP> yowling and barking <SEP> fighting to get away <SEP> Even now they were snarling and whimpering by turns <SEP> pulling at their leashes while Chett cursed them for curs <SEP>
It is only a wood <SEP> Jon told himself <SEP> and they ’ re only dead men <SEP> He had seen dead men before …
Last night he had dreamt the Winterfell dream again <SEP> He was wandering the empty castle <SEP> searching for his father <SEP> descending into the crypts <SEP> Only this time the dream had gone further than before <SEP> In the dark he ’ d heard the scrape of stone on stone <SEP> When he turned he saw that the vaults were opening <SEP> one after the other <SEP> As the dead kings came stumbling from their cold black graves <SEP> Jon had woken in pitch-dark <SEP> his heart hammering <SEP> Even when Ghost leapt up on the bed to nuzzle at his face <SEP> he could not shake his deep sense of terror <SEP> He dared not go back to sleep <SEP> Instead he had climbed the Wall and walked <SEP> restless <SEP> until he saw the light of the dawn off to the east <SEP> It was only a dream <SEP> I am a brother of the Night ’ s Watch now <SEP> not a frightened boy <SEP>
Samwell Tarly huddled beneath the trees <SEP> half-hidden behind the horses <SEP> His round fat face was the color of curdled milk <SEP> So far he had not lurched off to the woods to retch <SEP> but he had not so much as glanced at the dead men either <SEP>  I can ’ t look <SEP>  he whispered miserably <SEP>
Jon told him <SEP> keeping his voice low so the others would not hear <SEP> <BOS> You have to look <SEP> Maester Aemon sent you to be his eyes <SEP> didn ’ t he? What good are eyes if they ’ re shut? <EOS>
Yes <SEP> but … I ’ m such a coward <SEP> Jon <SEP>
Jon put a hand on Sam ’ s shoulder <SEP> <BOS> We have a dozen rangers with us <SEP> and the dogs <SEP> even Ghost <SEP> No one will hurt you <SEP> Sam <SEP> Go ahead and look <SEP> The first look is the hardest <SEP> <EOS>
Sam gave a tremulous nod <SEP> working up his courage with a visible effort <SEP> Slowly he swiveled his head <SEP> His eyes widened <SEP> but Jon held his arm so he could not turn away <SEP>
Ser Jaremy <SEP>  the Old Bear asked gruffly <SEP>  Ben Stark had six men with him when he rode from the Wall <SEP> Where are the others?
Ser Jaremy shook his head <SEP>  Would that I knew <SEP>
Plainly Mormont was not pleased with that answer <SEP>  Two of our brothers butchered almost within sight of the Wall <SEP> yet your rangers heard nothing <SEP> saw nothing <SEP> Is this what the Night ’ s Watch has fallen to? Do we still sweep these woods?
Yes <SEP> my lord <SEP> but—
Do we still mount watches?
We do <SEP> but—
This man wears a hunting horn<SEP>  Mormont pointed at Othor <SEP>  Must I suppose that he died without sounding it? Or have your rangers all gone deaf as well as blind?
Ser Jaremy bristled <SEP> his face taut with anger <SEP>  No horn was blown <SEP> my lord <SEP> or my rangers would have heard it <SEP> I do not have sufficient men to mount as many patrols as I should like … and since Benjen was lost <SEP> we have stayed closer to the Wall than we were wont to do before <SEP> by your own command <SEP>
The Old Bear grunted <SEP>  Yes <SEP> Well <SEP> Be that as it may<SEP>  He made an impatient gesture <SEP>  Tell me how they died <SEP>
Squatting beside the dead man he had named Jafer Flowers <SEP> Ser Jaremy grasped his head by the scalp <SEP> The hair came out between his fingers <SEP> brittle as straw <SEP> The knight cursed and shoved at the face with the heel of his hand <SEP> A great gash in the side of the corpse ’ s neck opened like a mouth <SEP> crusted with dried blood <SEP> Only a few ropes of pale tendon still attached the head to the neck <SEP>  This was done with an axe <SEP>
Aye <SEP>  muttered Dywen <SEP> the old forester <SEP>  Belike the axe that Othor carried <SEP> m ’ lord <SEP>
Jon could feel his breakfast churning in his belly <SEP> but he pressed his lips together and made himself look at the second body <SEP> Othor had been a big ugly man <SEP> and he made a big ugly corpse <SEP> No axe was in evidence <SEP> Jon remembered Othor; he had been the one bellowing the bawdy song as the rangers rode out <SEP> His singing days were done <SEP> His flesh was blanched white as milk <SEP> everywhere but his hands <SEP> His hands were black like Jafer ’ s <SEP> Blossoms of hard cracked blood decorated the mortal wounds that covered him like a rash <SEP> breast and groin and throat <SEP> Yet his eyes were still open <SEP> They stared up at the sky <SEP> blue as sapphires <SEP>
Ser Jaremy stood <SEP>  The Wildlings have axes too <SEP>
Mormont rounded on him <SEP>  So you believe this is Mance Rayder ’ s work? This close to the Wall?
Who else <SEP> my lord?
Jon could have told him <SEP> He knew <SEP> they all knew <SEP> yet no man of them would say the words <SEP> The Others are only a story <SEP> a tale to make children shiver <SEP> If they ever lived at all <SEP> they are gone eight thousand years <SEP> Even the thought made him feel foolish; he was a man grown now <SEP> a black brother of the Night ’ s Watch <SEP> not the boy who ’ d once sat at Old Nan ’ s feet with Bran and Robb and Arya <SEP>
Yet Lord Commander Mormont gave a snort <SEP>  If Ben Stark had come under Wildling attack a half day ’ s ride from Castle Black <SEP> he would have returned for more men <SEP> chased the killers through all seven hells and brought me back their heads <SEP>
Unless he was slain as well <SEP>  Ser Jaremy insisted <SEP>
The words hurt <SEP> even now <SEP> It had been so long <SEP> it seemed folly to cling to the hope that Ben Stark was still alive <SEP> but Jon Snow was nothing if not stubborn <SEP>
It has been close on half a year since Benjen left us <SEP> my lord <SEP>  Ser Jaremy went on <SEP>  The forest is vast <SEP> The Wildlings might have fallen on him anywhere <SEP> I ’ d wager these two were the last survivors of his party <SEP> on their way back to us … but the enemy caught them before they could reach the safety of the Wall <SEP> The corpses are still fresh <SEP> these men cannot have been dead more than a day …
NO <SEP>  Samwell Tarly squeaked <SEP>
Jon was startled <SEP> Sam ’ s nervous <SEP> high-pitched voice was the last he would have expected to hear <SEP> The fat boy was frightened of the officers <SEP> and Ser Jaremy was not known for his patience <SEP>
I did not ask for your views <SEP> boy <SEP>  Rykker said coldly <SEP>
Jon blurted <SEP> <BOS> Let him speak <SEP> ser <SEP> <EOS>
Mormont ’ s eyes flicked from Sam to Jon and back again <SEP>  If the lad has something to say <SEP> I ’ ll hear him out <SEP> Come closer <SEP> boy <SEP> We can ’ t see you behind those horses <SEP>
Sam edged past Jon and the garrons <SEP> sweating profusely <SEP>  My lord <SEP> it … it can ’ t be a day or … look … the blood …
Yes?  Mormont growled impatiently <SEP>  Blood <SEP> what of it?
He soils his smallclothes at the sight of it <SEP>  Chett shouted out <SEP> and the rangers laughed <SEP>
Sam mopped at the sweat on his brow <SEP>  You … you can see where Ghost … Jon ’ s direwolf … you can see where he tore off that man ’ s hand <SEP> and yet … the stump hasn ’ t bled <SEP> look …  He waved a hand <SEP>  My father … L-lord Randyll <SEP> he <SEP> he made me watch him dress animals sometimes <SEP> when … after …  Sam shook his head from side to side <SEP> his chins quivering <SEP> Now that he had looked at the bodies <SEP> he could not seem to look away <SEP>  A fresh kill … the blood would still flow <SEP> my lords <SEP> Later … later it would be clotted <SEP> like a … a jelly <SEP> thick and … and …  He looked as though he was going to be sick <SEP>  This man … look at the wrist <SEP> it ’ s all … crusty … dry … like …
Jon saw at once what Sam meant <SEP> He could see the torn veins in the dead man ’ s wrist <SEP> iron worms in the pale flesh <SEP> His blood was a black dust <SEP> Yet Jaremy Rykker was unconvinced <SEP> <BOS> If they ’ d been dead much longer than a day <SEP> they ’ d be ripe by now <SEP> boy <SEP> They don ’ t even smell <SEP> <EOS>
Dywen <SEP> the gnarled old forester who liked to boast that he could smell snow coming on <SEP> sidled closer to the corpses and took a whiff <SEP>  Well <SEP> they ’ re no pansy flowers <SEP> but … m ’ lord has the truth of it <SEP> There ’ s no corpse stink <SEP>
They … they aren ’ t rotting<SEP>  Sam pointed <SEP> his fat finger shaking only a little <SEP>  Look <SEP> there ’ s … there ’ s no maggots or … or … worms or anything … they ’ ve been lying here in the woods <SEP> but they … they haven ’ t been chewed or eaten by animals … only Ghost … otherwise they ’ re … they ’ re …
Jon said softly <SEP> <BOS> Untouched <SEP> And Ghost is different <SEP> The dogs and the horses won ’ t go near them <SEP> <EOS>
The rangers exchanged glances; they could see it was true <SEP> every man of them <SEP> Mormont frowned <SEP> glancing from the corpses to the dogs <SEP>  Chett <SEP> bring the hounds closer <SEP>
Chett tried <SEP> cursing <SEP> yanking on the leashes <SEP> giving one animal a lick of his boot <SEP> Most of the dogs just whimpered and planted their feet <SEP> He tried dragging one <SEP> The bitch resisted <SEP> growling and squirming as if to escape her collar <SEP> Finally she lunged at him <SEP> Chett dropped the leash and stumbled backward <SEP> The dog leapt over him and bounded off into the trees <SEP>
This … this is all wrong <SEP>  Sam Tarly said earnestly <SEP>  The blood … there ’ s bloodstains on their clothes <SEP> and … and their flesh <SEP> dry and hard <SEP> but … there ’ s none on the ground <SEP> or … anywhere <SEP> With those … those … those …  Sam made himself swallow <SEP> took a deep breath <SEP>  With those wounds … terrible wounds … there should be blood all over <SEP> Shouldn ’ t there?
Dywen sucked at his wooden teeth <SEP>  Might be they didn ’ t die here <SEP> Might be someone brought ’ em and left ’ em for us <SEP> A warning <SEP> as like<SEP>  The old forester peered down suspiciously <SEP>  And might be I ’ m a fool <SEP> but I don ’ t know that Othor never had no blue eyes afore <SEP>
Ser Jaremy looked startled <SEP>  Neither did Flowers <SEP>  he blurted <SEP> turning to stare at the dead man <SEP>
A silence fell over the wood <SEP> For a moment all they heard was Sam ’ s heavy breathing and the wet sound of Dywen sucking on his teeth <SEP> Jon squatted beside Ghost <SEP>
Burn them <SEP>  someone whispered <SEP> One of the rangers; Jon could not have said who <SEP>  Yes <SEP> burn them <SEP>  a second voice urged <SEP>
The Old Bear gave a stubborn shake of his head <SEP>  Not yet <SEP> I want Maester Aemon to have a look at them <SEP> We ’ ll bring them back to the Wall <SEP>
Some commands are more easily given than obeyed <SEP> They wrapped the dead men in cloaks <SEP> but when Hake and Dywen tried to tie one onto a horse <SEP> the animal went mad <SEP> screaming and rearing <SEP> lashing out with its hooves <SEP> even biting at Ketter when he ran to help <SEP> The rangers had no better luck with the other garrons; not even the most placid wanted any part of these burdens <SEP> In the end they were forced to hack off branches and fashion crude slings to carry the corpses back on foot <SEP> It was well past midday by the time they started back <SEP>
I will have these woods searched <SEP>  Mormont commanded Ser Jaremy as they set out <SEP>  Every tree <SEP> every rock <SEP> every bush <SEP> and every foot of muddy ground within ten leagues of here <SEP> Use all the men you have <SEP> and if you do not have enough <SEP> borrow hunters and foresters from the stewards <SEP> If Ben and the others are out here <SEP> dead or alive <SEP> I will have them found <SEP> And if there is anyone else in these woods <SEP> I will know of it <SEP> You are to track them and take them <SEP> alive if possible <SEP> Is that understood?
It is <SEP> my lord <SEP>  Ser Jaremy said <SEP>  It will be done <SEP>
After that <SEP> Mormont rode in silence <SEP> brooding <SEP> Jon followed close behind him; as the Lord Commander ’ s steward <SEP> that was his place <SEP> The day was grey <SEP> damp <SEP> overcast <SEP> the sort of day that made you wish for rain <SEP> No wind stirred the wood; the air hung humid and heavy <SEP> and Jon ’ s clothes clung to his skin <SEP> It was warm <SEP> Too warm <SEP> The Wall was weeping copiously <SEP> had been weeping for days <SEP> and sometimes Jon even imagined it was shrinking <SEP>
The old men called this weather spirit summer <SEP> and said it meant the season was giving up its ghosts at last <SEP> After this the cold would come <SEP> they warned <SEP> and a long summer always meant a long winter <SEP> This summer had lasted ten years <SEP> Jon had been a babe in arms when it began <SEP>
Ghost ran with them for a time and then vanished among the trees <SEP> Without the direwolf <SEP> Jon felt almost naked <SEP> He found himself glancing at every shadow with unease <SEP> Unbidden <SEP> he thought back on the tales that Old Nan used to tell them <SEP> when he was a boy at Winterfell <SEP> He could almost hear her voice again <SEP> and the click-click-click of her needles <SEP> In that darkness <SEP> the Others came riding <SEP> she used to say <SEP> dropping her voice lower and lower <SEP> Cold and dead they were <SEP> and they hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun <SEP> and every living creature with hot blood in its veins <SEP> Holdfasts and cities and kingdoms of men all fell before them <SEP> as they moved south on pale dead horses <SEP> leading hosts of the slain <SEP> They fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children …
When he caught his first glimpse of the Wall looming above the tops of an ancient gnarled oak <SEP> Jon was vastly relieved <SEP> Mormont reined up suddenly and turned in his saddle <SEP>  Tarly <SEP>  he barked <SEP>  come here <SEP>
Jon saw the start of fright on Sam ’ s face as he lumbered up on his mare; doubtless he thought he was in trouble <SEP>  You ’ re fat but you ’ re not stupid <SEP> boy <SEP>  the Old Bear said gruffly <SEP>  You did well back there <SEP> And you <SEP> Snow <SEP>
Sam blushed a vivid crimson and tripped over his own tongue as he tried to stammer out a courtesy <SEP> Jon had to smile <SEP>
When they emerged from under the trees <SEP> Mormont spurred his tough little garron to a trot <SEP> Ghost came streaking out from the woods to meet them <SEP> licking his chops <SEP> his muzzle red from prey <SEP> High above <SEP> the men on the Wall saw the column approaching <SEP> Jon heard the deep <SEP> throaty call of the watchman ’ s great horn <SEP> calling out across the miles; a single long blast that shuddered through the trees and echoed off the ice <SEP>
UUUUUUUoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo <SEP>
The sound faded slowly to silence <SEP> One blast meant rangers returning <SEP> and Jon thought <SEP> I was a ranger for one day <SEP> at least <SEP> Whatever may come <SEP> they cannot take that away from me <SEP>
Bowen Marsh was waiting at the first gate as they led their garrons through the icy tunnel <SEP> The Lord Steward was red-faced and agitated <SEP>  My lord <SEP>  he blurted at Mormont as he swung open the iron bars <SEP>  there ’ s been a bird <SEP> you must come at once <SEP>
What is it <SEP> man?  Mormont said gruffly <SEP>
Curiously <SEP> Marsh glanced at Jon before he answered <SEP>  Maester Aemon has the letter <SEP> He ’ s waiting in your solar <SEP>
Very well <SEP> Jon <SEP> see to my horse <SEP> and tell Ser Jaremy to put the dead men in a storeroom until the maester is ready for them<SEP>  Mormont strode away grumbling <SEP>
As they led their horses back to the stable <SEP> Jon was uncomfortably aware that people were watching him <SEP> Ser Alliser Thorne was drilling his boys in the yard <SEP> but he broke off to stare at Jon <SEP> a faint half smile on his lips <SEP> One-armed Donal Noye stood in the door of the armory <SEP>  The gods be with you <SEP> Snow <SEP>  he called out <SEP>
Something ’ s wrong <SEP> Jon thought <SEP> Something ’ s very wrong <SEP>
The dead men were carried to one of the storerooms along the base of the Wall <SEP> a dark cold cell chiseled from the ice and used to keep meat and grain and sometimes even beer <SEP> Jon saw that Mormont ’ s horse was fed and watered and groomed before he took care of his own <SEP> Afterward he sought out his friends <SEP> Grenn and Toad were on watch <SEP> but he found Pyp in the common hall <SEP>  What ’ s happened?  he asked <SEP>
Pyp lowered his voice <SEP>  The king ’ s dead <SEP>
Jon was stunned <SEP> Robert Baratheon had looked old and fat when he visited Winterfell <SEP> yet he ’ d seemed hale enough <SEP> and there ’ d been no talk of illness <SEP> <BOS> How can you know? <EOS>
One of the guards overheard Clydas reading the letter to Maester Aemon<SEP>  Pyp leaned close <SEP>  Jon <SEP> I ’ m sorry <SEP> He was your father ’ s friend <SEP> wasn ’ t he?
Jon wondered if Joffrey would keep his father as the King ’ s Hand <SEP> It did not seem likely <SEP> That might mean Lord Eddard would return to Winterfell <SEP> and his sisters as well <SEP> He might even be allowed to visit them <SEP> with Lord Mormont ’ s permission <SEP> It would be good to see Arya ’ s grin again and to talk with his father <SEP> I will ask him about my mother <SEP> he resolved <SEP> I am a man now <SEP> it is past time he told me <SEP> Even if she was a whore <SEP> I don ’ t care <SEP> I want to know <SEP> <BOS> They were as close as brothers <SEP> once<SEP> <EOS>
I heard Hake say the dead men were your uncle ’ s <SEP>  Pyp said <SEP>
Jon replied <SEP> <BOS> Yes <SEP> Two of the six he took with him <SEP> They ’ d been dead a long time <SEP> only … the bodies are queer <SEP> <EOS>
Queer?  Pyp was all curiosity <SEP>  How queer?
Sam will tell you<SEP>  Jon did not want to talk of it <SEP>  I should see if the Old Bear has need of me <SEP>
He walked to the Lord Commander ’ s Tower alone <SEP> with a curious sense of apprehension <SEP> The brothers on guard eyed him solemnly as he approached <SEP>  The Old Bear ’ s in his solar <SEP>  one of them announced <SEP>  He was asking for you <SEP>
Jon nodded <SEP> He should have come straight from the stable <SEP> He climbed the tower steps briskly <SEP> He wants wine or a fire in his hearth <SEP> that ’ s all <SEP> he told himself <SEP>
When he entered the solar <SEP> Mormont ’ s raven screamed at him <SEP>  Corn!  the bird shrieked <SEP>  Corn! Corn! Corn!
Don ’ t you believe it <SEP> I just fed him <SEP>  the Old Bear growled <SEP> He was seated by the window <SEP> reading a letter <SEP>  Bring me a cup of wine <SEP> and pour one for yourself <SEP>
For myself <SEP> my lord?
Mormont lifted his eyes from the letter to stare at Jon <SEP> There was pity in that look; he could taste it <SEP>  You heard me <SEP>
Jon poured with exaggerated care <SEP> vaguely aware that he was drawing out the act <SEP> When the cups were filled <SEP> he would have no choice but to face whatever was in that letter <SEP> Yet all too soon <SEP> they were filled <SEP>  Sit <SEP> boy <SEP>  Mormont commanded him <SEP>  Drink <SEP>
Jon remained standing <SEP> <BOS> It ’ s my father <SEP> isn ’ t it? <EOS>
The Old Bear tapped the letter with a finger <SEP>  Your father and the king <SEP>  he rumbled <SEP>  I won ’ t lie to you <SEP> it ’ s grievous news <SEP> I never thought to see another king <SEP> not at my age <SEP> with Robert half my years and strong as a bull<SEP>  He took a gulp of wine <SEP>  They say the king loved to hunt <SEP> The things we love destroy us every time <SEP> lad <SEP> Remember that <SEP> My son loved that young wife of his <SEP> Vain woman <SEP> If not for her <SEP> he would never have thought to sell those poachers <SEP>
Jon could scarcely follow what he was saying <SEP> <BOS> My lord <SEP> I don ’ t understand <SEP> What ’ s happened to my father? <EOS>
I told you to sit <SEP>  Mormont grumbled <SEP>  Sit <SEP>  the raven screamed <SEP>  And have a drink <SEP> damn you <SEP> That ’ s a command <SEP> Snow <SEP>
Jon sat <SEP> and took a sip of wine <SEP>
Lord Eddard has been imprisoned <SEP> He is charged with treason <SEP> It is said he plotted with Robert ’ s brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey <SEP>
Jon said at once <SEP> <BOS> No <SEP> That couldn ’ t be <SEP> My father would never betray the king! <EOS>
Be that as it may <SEP>  said Mormont <SEP>  It is not for me to say <SEP> Nor for you <SEP>
Jon insisted <SEP> How could they think his father was a traitor <SEP> had they all gone mad? Lord Eddard Stark would never dishonor himself … would he? <BOS> But it ’ s a lie <SEP> <EOS>
He fathered a bastard <SEP> a small voice whispered inside him <SEP> Where was the honor in that? And your mother <SEP> what of her? He will not even speak her name <SEP>
My lord <SEP> what will happen to him? Will they kill him?
As to that <SEP> I cannot say <SEP> lad <SEP> I mean to send a letter <SEP> I knew some of the king ’ s councillors in my youth <SEP> Old Pycelle <SEP> Lord Stannis <SEP> Ser Barristan … Whatever your father has done <SEP> or hasn ’ t done <SEP> he is a great lord <SEP> He must be allowed to take the black and join us here <SEP> Gods knows <SEP> we need men of Lord Eddard ’ s ability <SEP>
Jon knew that other men accused of treason had been allowed to redeem their honor on the Wall in days past <SEP> Why not Lord Eddard? His father here <SEP> That was a strange thought <SEP> and strangely uncomfortable <SEP> It would be a monstrous injustice to strip him of Winterfell and force him to take the black <SEP> and yet if it meant his life …
And would Joffrey allow it? He remembered the prince at Winterfell <SEP> the way he ’ d mocked Robb and Ser Rodrik in the yard <SEP> Jon himself he had scarcely even noticed; bastards were beneath even his contempt <SEP>  My lord <SEP> will the king listen to you?
The Old Bear shrugged <SEP>  A boy king … I imagine he ’ ll listen to his mother <SEP> A pity the dwarf isn ’ t with them <SEP> He ’ s the lad ’ s uncle <SEP> and he saw our need when he visited us <SEP> It was a bad thing <SEP> your lady mother taking him captive—
Jon reminded him sharply <SEP> Tyrion Lannister had been a friend to him <SEP> If Lord Eddard was killed <SEP> she would be as much to blame as the queen <SEP> <BOS> Lady Stark is not my mother <SEP> My lord <SEP> what of my sisters? Arya and Sansa <SEP> they were with my father <SEP> do you know— <EOS>
Pycelle makes no mention of them <SEP> but doubtless they ’ ll be treated gently <SEP> I will ask about them when I write<SEP>  Mormont shook his head <SEP>  This could not have happened at a worse time <SEP> If ever the realm needed a strong king … there are dark days and cold nights ahead <SEP> I feel it in my bones …  He gave Jon a long shrewd look <SEP>  I hope you are not thinking of doing anything stupid <SEP> boy <SEP>
He ’ s my father <SEP> Jon wanted to say <SEP> but he knew that Mormont would not want to hear it <SEP> His throat was dry <SEP> He made himself take another sip of wine <SEP>
Your duty is here now <SEP>  the Lord Commander reminded him <SEP>  Your old life ended when you took the black<SEP>  His bird made a raucous echo <SEP>  Black<SEP>  Mormont took no notice <SEP>  Whatever they do in King ’ s Landing is none of our concern<SEP>  When Jon did not answer <SEP> the old man finished his wine and said <SEP>  You ’ re free to go <SEP> I ’ ll have no further need of you today <SEP> On the morrow you can help me write that letter <SEP>
Jon did not remember standing or leaving the solar <SEP> The next he knew <SEP> he was descending the tower steps <SEP> thinking <SEP> This is my father <SEP> my sisters <SEP> how can it be none of my concern <SEP>
Outside <SEP> one of the guards looked at him and said <SEP>  Be strong <SEP> boy <SEP> The gods are cruel <SEP>
They know <SEP> Jon realized <SEP>  My father is no traitor <SEP>  he said hoarsely <SEP> Even the words stuck in his throat <SEP> as if to choke him <SEP> The wind was rising <SEP> and it seemed colder in the yard than it had when he ’ d gone in <SEP> Spirit summer was drawing to an end <SEP>
The rest of the afternoon passed as if in a dream <SEP> Jon could not have said where he walked <SEP> what he did <SEP> who he spoke with <SEP> Ghost was with him <SEP> he knew that much <SEP> The silent presence of the direwolf gave him comfort <SEP> The girls do not even have that much <SEP> he thought <SEP> Their wolves might have kept them safe <SEP> but Lady is dead and Nymeria ’ s lost <SEP> they ’ re all alone <SEP>
A north wind had begun to blow by the time the sun went down <SEP> Jon could hear it skirling against the Wall and over the icy battlements as he went to the common hall for the evening meal <SEP> Hobb had cooked up a venison stew <SEP> thick with barley <SEP> onions <SEP> and carrots <SEP> When he spooned an extra portion onto Jon ’ s plate and gave him the crusty heel of the bread <SEP> he knew what it meant <SEP> He knows <SEP> He looked around the hall <SEP> saw heads turn quickly <SEP> eyes politely averted <SEP> They all know <SEP>
His friends rallied to him <SEP>  We asked the septon to light a candle for your father <SEP>  Matthar told him <SEP>  It ’ s a lie <SEP> we all know it ’ s a lie <SEP> even Grenn knows it ’ s a lie <SEP>  Pyp chimed in <SEP> Grenn nodded <SEP> and Sam clasped Jon ’ s hand <SEP>  You ’ re my brother now <SEP> so he ’ s my father too <SEP>  the fat boy said <SEP>  If you want to go out to the weirwoods and pray to the old gods <SEP> I ’ ll go with you <SEP>
The weirwoods were beyond the Wall <SEP> yet he knew Sam meant what he said <SEP> They are my brothers <SEP> he thought <SEP> As much as Robb and Bran and Rickon …
And then he heard the laughter <SEP> sharp and cruel as a whip <SEP> and the voice of Ser Alliser Thorne <SEP>  Not only a bastard <SEP> but a traitor ’ s bastard <SEP>  he was telling the men around him <SEP>
In the blink of an eye <SEP> Jon had vaulted onto the table <SEP> dagger in his hand <SEP> Pyp made a grab for him <SEP> but he wrenched his leg away <SEP> and then he was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from Ser Alliser ’ s hand <SEP> Stew went flying everywhere <SEP> spattering the brothers <SEP> Thorne recoiled <SEP> People were shouting <SEP> but Jon Snow did not hear them <SEP> He lunged at Ser Alliser ’ s face with the dagger <SEP> slashing at those cold onyx eyes <SEP> but Sam threw himself between them and before Jon could get around him <SEP> Pyp was on his back clinging like a monkey <SEP> and Grenn was grabbing his arm while Toad wrenched the knife from his fingers <SEP>
Later <SEP> much later <SEP> after they had marched him back to his sleeping cell <SEP> Mormont came down to see him <SEP> raven on his shoulder <SEP>  I told you not to do anything stupid <SEP> boy <SEP>  the Old Bear said <SEP>  Boy <SEP>  the bird chorused <SEP> Mormont shook his head <SEP> disgusted <SEP>  And to think I had high hopes for you <SEP>
They took his knife and his sword and told him he was not to leave his cell until the high officers met to decide what was to be done with him <SEP> And then they placed a guard outside his door to make certain he obeyed <SEP> His friends were not allowed to see him <SEP> but the Old Bear did relent and permit him Ghost <SEP> so he was not utterly alone <SEP>
My father is no traitor <SEP>  he told the direwolf when the rest had gone <SEP> Ghost looked at him in silence <SEP> Jon slumped against the wall <SEP> hands around his knees <SEP> and stared at the candle on the table beside his narrow bed <SEP> The flame flickered and swayed <SEP> the shadows moved around him <SEP> the room seemed to grow darker and colder <SEP> I will not sleep tonight <SEP> Jon thought <SEP>
Yet he must have dozed <SEP> When he woke <SEP> his legs were stiff and cramped and the candle had long since burned out <SEP> Ghost stood on his hind legs <SEP> scrabbling at the door <SEP> Jon was startled to see how tall he ’ d grown <SEP>  Ghost <SEP> what is it?  he called softly <SEP> The direwolf turned his head and looked down at him <SEP> baring his fangs in a silent snarl <SEP> Has he gone mad? Jon wondered <SEP>  It ’ s me <SEP> Ghost <SEP>  he murmured <SEP> trying not to sound afraid <SEP> Yet he was trembling <SEP> violently <SEP> When had it gotten so cold?
Ghost backed away from the door <SEP> There were deep gouges where he ’ d raked the wood <SEP> Jon watched him with mounting disquiet <SEP>  There ’ s someone out there <SEP> isn ’ t there?  he whispered <SEP> Crouching <SEP> the direwolf crept backward <SEP> white fur rising on the back of his neck <SEP> The guard <SEP> he thought <SEP> they left a man to guard my door <SEP> Ghost smells him through the door <SEP> that ’ s all it is <SEP>
Slowly <SEP> Jon pushed himself to his feet <SEP> He was shivering uncontrollably <SEP> wishing he still had a sword <SEP> Three quick steps brought him to the door <SEP> He grabbed the handle and pulled it inward <SEP> The creak of the hinges almost made him jump <SEP>
His guard was sprawled bonelessly across the narrow steps <SEP> looking up at him <SEP> Looking up at him <SEP> even though he was lying on his stomach <SEP> His head had been twisted completely around <SEP>
It can ’ t be <SEP> Jon told himself <SEP> This is the Lord Commander ’ s Tower <SEP> it ’ s guarded day and night <SEP> this couldn ’ t happen <SEP> it ’ s a dream <SEP> I ’ m having a nightmare <SEP>
Ghost slid past him <SEP> out the door <SEP> The wolf started up the steps <SEP> stopped <SEP> looked back at Jon <SEP> That was when he heard it; the soft scrape of a boot on stone <SEP> the sound of a latch turning <SEP> The sounds came from above <SEP> From the Lord Commander ’ s chambers <SEP>
A nightmare this might be <SEP> yet it was no dream <SEP>
The guard ’ s sword was in its sheath <SEP> Jon knelt and worked it free <SEP> The heft of steel in his fist made him bolder <SEP> He moved up the steps <SEP> Ghost padding silently before him <SEP> Shadows lurked in every turn of the stair <SEP> Jon crept up warily <SEP> probing any suspicious darkness with the point of his sword <SEP>
Suddenly he heard the shriek of Mormont ’ s raven <SEP>  Corn <SEP>  the bird was screaming <SEP>  Corn <SEP> corn <SEP> corn <SEP> corn <SEP> corn <SEP> corn<SEP>  Ghost bounded ahead <SEP> and Jon came scrambling after <SEP> The door to Mormont ’ s solar was wide open <SEP> The direwolf plunged through <SEP> Jon stopped in the doorway <SEP> blade in hand <SEP> giving his eyes a moment to adjust <SEP> Heavy drapes had been pulled across the windows <SEP> and the darkness was black as ink <SEP>  Who ’ s there?  he called out <SEP>
Then he saw it <SEP> a shadow in the shadows <SEP> sliding toward the inner door that led to Mormont ’ s sleeping cell <SEP> a man-shape all in black <SEP> cloaked and hooded … but beneath the hood <SEP> its eyes shone with an icy blue radiance …
Ghost leapt <SEP> Man and wolf went down together with neither scream nor snarl <SEP> rolling <SEP> smashing into a chair <SEP> knocking over a table laden with papers <SEP> Mormont ’ s raven was flapping overhead <SEP> screaming <SEP> Jon felt as blind as Maester Aemon <SEP> Keeping the wall to his back <SEP> he slid toward the window and ripped down the curtain <SEP> Moonlight flooded the solar <SEP> He glimpsed black hands buried in white fur <SEP> swollen dark fingers tightening around his direwolf ’ s throat <SEP> Ghost was twisting and snapping <SEP> legs flailing in the air <SEP> but he could not break free <SEP> <BOS> Corn <SEP> corn <SEP> corn <SEP> corn<SEP> <EOS>
Jon had no time to be afraid <SEP> He threw himself forward <SEP> shouting <SEP> bringing down the longsword with all his weight behind it <SEP> Steel sheared through sleeve and skin and bone <SEP> yet the sound was wrong somehow <SEP> The smell that engulfed him was so queer and cold he almost gagged <SEP> He saw arm and hand on the floor <SEP> black fingers wriggling in a pool of moonlight <SEP> Ghost wrenched free of the other hand and crept away <SEP> red tongue lolling from his mouth <SEP>
The hooded man lifted his pale moon face <SEP> and Jon slashed at it without hesitation <SEP> The sword laid the intruder open to the bone <SEP> taking off half his nose and opening a gash cheek to cheek under those eyes <SEP> eyes <SEP> eyes like blue stars burning <SEP> Jon knew that face <SEP> Othor <SEP> he thought <SEP> reeling back <SEP> Gods <SEP> he ’ s dead <SEP> he ’ s dead <SEP> I saw him dead <SEP>
He felt something scrabble at his ankle <SEP> Black fingers clawed at his calf <SEP> The arm was crawling up his leg <SEP> ripping at wool and flesh <SEP> Shouting with revulsion <SEP> Jon pried the fingers off his leg with the point of his sword and flipped the thing away <SEP> It lay writhing <SEP> fingers opening and closing <SEP>
The corpse lurched forward <SEP> There was no blood <SEP> One-armed <SEP> face cut near in half <SEP> it seemed to feel nothing <SEP> Jon held the longsword before him <SEP>  Stay away!  he commanded <SEP> his voice gone shrill <SEP>  Corn <SEP>  screamed the raven <SEP>  corn <SEP> corn<SEP>  The severed arm was wriggling out of its torn sleeve <SEP> a pale snake with a black five-fingered head <SEP> Ghost pounced and got it between his teeth <SEP> Finger bones crunched <SEP> Jon hacked at the corpse ’ s neck <SEP> felt the steel bite deep and hard <SEP>
Dead Othor slammed into him <SEP> knocking him off his feet <SEP>
Jon ’ s breath went out of him as the fallen table caught him between his shoulder blades <SEP> The sword <SEP> where was the sword? He ’ d lost the damned sword! When he opened his mouth to scream <SEP> the wight jammed its black corpse fingers into Jon ’ s mouth <SEP> Gagging <SEP> he tried to shove it off <SEP> but the dead man was too heavy <SEP> Its hand forced itself farther down his throat <SEP> icy cold <SEP> choking him <SEP> Its face was against his own <SEP> filling the world <SEP> Frost covered its eyes <SEP> sparkling blue <SEP> Jon raked cold flesh with his nails and kicked at the thing ’ s legs <SEP> He tried to bite <SEP> tried to punch <SEP> tried to breathe …
And suddenly the corpse ’ s weight was gone <SEP> its fingers ripped from his throat <SEP> It was all Jon could do to roll over <SEP> retching and shaking <SEP> Ghost had it again <SEP> He watched as the direwolf buried his teeth in the wight ’ s gut and began to rip and tear <SEP> He watched <SEP> only half conscious <SEP> for a long moment before he finally remembered to look for his sword …
… and saw Lord Mormont <SEP> naked and groggy from sleep <SEP> standing in the doorway with an oil lamp in hand <SEP> Gnawed and fingerless <SEP> the arm thrashed on the floor <SEP> wriggling toward him <SEP>
Jon tried to shout <SEP> but his voice was gone <SEP> Staggering to his feet <SEP> he kicked the arm away and snatched the lamp from the Old Bear ’ s fingers <SEP> The flame flickered and almost died <SEP>  Burn!  the raven cawed <SEP>  Burn <SEP> burn <SEP> burn!
Spinning <SEP> Jon saw the drapes he ’ d ripped from the window <SEP> He flung the lamp into the puddled cloth with both hands <SEP> Metal crunched <SEP> glass shattered <SEP> oil spewed <SEP> and the hangings went up in a great whoosh of flame <SEP> The heat of it on his face was sweeter than any kiss Jon had ever known <SEP>  Ghost!  he shouted <SEP>
The direwolf wrenched free and came to him as the wight struggled to rise <SEP> dark snakes spilling from the great wound in its belly <SEP> Jon plunged his hand into the flames <SEP> grabbed a fistful of the burning drapes <SEP> and whipped them at the dead man <SEP> Let it burn <SEP> he prayed as the cloth smothered the corpse <SEP> gods <SEP> please <SEP> please <SEP> let it burn <SEP>
Are you well <SEP> Snow?  Lord Mormont asked <SEP> scowling <SEP>
Well <SEP>  his raven squawked <SEP>  Well <SEP>
Jon lied … loudly <SEP> as if that could make it true <SEP> <BOS> I am <SEP> my lord <SEP> And you? <EOS>
Mormont frowned <SEP>  A dead man tried to kill me <SEP> How well could I be?  He scratched under his chin <SEP> His shaggy grey beard had been singed in the fire <SEP> and he ’ d hacked it off <SEP> The pale stubble of his new whiskers made him look old <SEP> disreputable <SEP> and grumpy <SEP>  You do not look well <SEP> How is your hand?
Jon flexed his bandaged fingers to show him <SEP> He had burned himself more badly than he knew throwing the flaming drapes <SEP> and his right hand was swathed in silk halfway to the elbow <SEP> At the time he ’ d felt nothing; the agony had come after <SEP> His cracked red skin oozed fluid <SEP> and fearsome blood blisters rose between his fingers <SEP> big as roaches <SEP> <BOS> Healing<SEP> The maester says I ’ ll have scars <SEP> but otherwise the hand should be as good as it was before <SEP> <EOS>
A scarred hand is nothing <SEP> On the Wall <SEP> you ’ ll be wearing gloves often as not <SEP>
As you say <SEP> my lord<SEP>  It was not the thought of scars that troubled Jon; it was the rest of it <SEP> Maester Aemon had given him milk of the poppy <SEP> yet even so <SEP> the pain had been hideous <SEP> At first it had felt as if his hand were still aflame <SEP> burning day and night <SEP> Only plunging it into basins of snow and shaved ice gave any relief at all <SEP> Jon thanked the gods that no one but Ghost saw him writhing on his bed <SEP> whimpering from the pain <SEP> And when at last he did sleep <SEP> he dreamt <SEP> and that was even worse <SEP> In the dream <SEP> the corpse he fought had blue eyes <SEP> black hands <SEP> and his father ’ s face <SEP> but he dared not tell Mormont that <SEP>
Dywen and Hake returned last night <SEP>  the Old Bear said <SEP>  They found no sign of your uncle <SEP> no more than the others did <SEP>
I know<SEP>  Jon had dragged himself to the common hall to sup with his friends <SEP> and the failure of the rangers ’ search had been all the men had been talking of <SEP>
You know <SEP>  Mormont grumbled <SEP>  How is it that everyone knows everything around here?  He did not seem to expect an answer <SEP>  It would seem there were only the two of … of those creatures <SEP> whatever they were <SEP> I will not call them men <SEP> And thank the gods for that <SEP> Any more and … well <SEP> that doesn ’ t bear thinking of <SEP> There will be more <SEP> though <SEP> I can feel it in these old bones of mine <SEP> and Maester Aemon agrees <SEP> The cold winds are rising <SEP> Summer is at an end <SEP> and a winter is coming such as this world has never seen <SEP>
Winter is coming <SEP> The Stark words had never sounded so grim or ominous to Jon as they did now <SEP>  My lord <SEP>  he asked hesitantly <SEP>  it ’ s said there was a bird last night …
There was <SEP> What of it?
I had hoped for some word of my father <SEP>
Father <SEP>  taunted the old raven <SEP> bobbing its head as it walked across Mormont ’ s shoulders <SEP>  Father <SEP>
The Lord Commander reached up to pinch its beak shut <SEP> but the raven hopped up on his head <SEP> fluttered its wings <SEP> and flew across the chamber to light above a window <SEP>  Grief and noise <SEP>  Mormont grumbled <SEP>  That ’ s all they ’ re good for <SEP> ravens <SEP> Why I put up with that pestilential bird … if there was news of Lord Eddard <SEP> don ’ t you think I would have sent for you? Bastard or no <SEP> you ’ re still his blood <SEP> The message concerned Ser Barristan Selmy <SEP> It seems he ’ s been removed from the Kingsguard <SEP> They gave his place to that black dog Clegane <SEP> and now Selmy ’ s wanted for treason <SEP> The fools sent some watchmen to seize him <SEP> but he slew two of them and escaped<SEP>  Mormont snorted <SEP> leaving no doubt of his view of men who ’ d send gold cloaks against a knight as renowed as Barristan the Bold <SEP>  We have white shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls <SEP> and a boy sits the Iron Throne <SEP>  he said in disgust <SEP>
The raven laughed shrilly <SEP>  Boy <SEP> boy <SEP> boy <SEP> boy <SEP>
Ser Barristan had been the Old Bear ’ s best hope <SEP> Jon remembered; if he had fallen <SEP> what chance was there that Mormont ’ s letter would be heeded? He curled his hand into a fist <SEP> Pain shot through his burned fingers <SEP>  What of my sisters?
The message made no mention of Lord Eddard or the girls<SEP>  He gave an irritated shrug <SEP>  Perhaps they never got my letter <SEP> Aemon sent two copies <SEP> with his best birds <SEP> but who can say? More like <SEP> Pycelle did not deign to reply <SEP> It would not be the first time <SEP> nor the last <SEP> I fear we count for less than nothing in King ’ s Landing <SEP> They tell us what they want us to know <SEP> and that ’ s little enough <SEP>
And you tell me what you want me to know <SEP> and that ’ s less <SEP> Jon thought resentfully <SEP> His brother Robb had called the banners and ridden south to war <SEP> yet no word of that had been breathed to him … save by Samwell Tarly <SEP> who ’ d read the letter to Maester Aemon and whispered its contents to Jon that night in secret <SEP> all the time saying how he shouldn ’ t <SEP> Doubtless they thought his brother ’ s war was none of his concern <SEP> It troubled him more than he could say <SEP> Robb was marching and he was not <SEP> No matter how often Jon told himself that his place was here now <SEP> with his new brothers on the Wall <SEP> he still felt craven <SEP>
Corn <SEP>  the raven was crying <SEP>  Corn <SEP> corn <SEP>
Oh <SEP> be quiet <SEP>  the Old Bear told it <SEP>  Snow <SEP> how soon does Maester Aemon say you ’ ll have use of that hand back?
Jon replied <SEP> <BOS> Soon <SEP> <EOS>
Good<SEP>  On the table between them <SEP> Lord Mormont laid a large sword in a black metal scabbard banded with silver <SEP>  Here <SEP> You ’ ll be ready for this <SEP> then <SEP>
The raven flapped down and landed on the table <SEP> strutting toward the sword <SEP> head cocked curiously <SEP> Jon hesitated <SEP> He had no inkling what this meant <SEP>  My lord?
The fire melted the silver off the pommel and burnt the crossguard and grip <SEP> Well <SEP> dry leather and old wood <SEP> what could you expect? The blade <SEP> now … you ’ d need a fire a hundred times as hot to harm the blade<SEP>  Mormont shoved the scabbard across the rough oak planks <SEP>  I had the rest made anew <SEP> Take it <SEP>
Take it <SEP>  echoed his raven <SEP> preening <SEP>  Take it <SEP> take it <SEP>
Awkwardly <SEP> Jon took the sword in hand <SEP> His left hand; his bandaged right was still too raw and clumsy <SEP> Carefully he pulled it from its scabbard and raised it level with his eyes <SEP>
The pommel was a hunk of pale stone weighted with lead to balance the long blade <SEP> It had been carved into the likeness of a snarling wolf ’ s head <SEP> with chips of garnet set into the eyes <SEP> The grip was virgin leather <SEP> soft and black <SEP> as yet unstained by sweat or blood <SEP> The blade itself was a good half foot longer than those Jon was used to <SEP> tapered to thrust as well as slash <SEP> with three fullers deeply incised in the metal <SEP> Where Ice was a true two-handed greatsword <SEP> this was a hand-and-a-halfer <SEP> sometimes named a  bastard sword<SEP>  Yet the wolf sword actually seemed lighter than the blades he had wielded before <SEP> When Jon turned it sideways <SEP> he could see the ripples in the dark steel where the metal had been folded back on itself again and again <SEP>  This is Valyrian steel <SEP> my lord <SEP>  he said wonderingly <SEP> His father had let him handle Ice often enough; he knew the look <SEP> the feel <SEP>
It is <SEP>  the Old Bear told him <SEP>  It was my father ’ s sword <SEP> and his father ’ s before him <SEP> The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries <SEP> I wielded it in my day and passed it on to my son when I took the black <SEP>
He is giving me his son ’ s sword <SEP> Jon could scarcely believe it <SEP> The blade was exquisitely balanced <SEP> The edges glimmered faintly as they kissed the light <SEP>  Your son—
My son brought dishonor to House Mormont <SEP> but at least he had the grace to leave the sword behind when he fled <SEP> My sister returned it to my keeping <SEP> but the very sight of it reminded me of Jorah ’ s shame <SEP> so I put it aside and thought no more of it until we found it in the ashes of my bedchamber <SEP> The original pommel was a bear ’ s head <SEP> silver <SEP> yet so worn its features were all but indistinguishable <SEP> For you <SEP> I thought a white wolf more apt <SEP> One of our builders is a fair stonecarver <SEP>
When Jon had been Bran ’ s age <SEP> he had dreamed of doing great deeds <SEP> as boys always did <SEP> The details of his feats changed with every dreaming <SEP> but quite often he imagined saving his father ’ s life <SEP> Afterward Lord Eddard would declare that Jon had proved himself a true Stark <SEP> and place Ice in his hand <SEP> Even then he had known it was only a child ’ s folly; no bastard could ever hope to wield a father ’ s sword <SEP> Even the memory shamed him <SEP> What kind of man stole his own brother ’ s birthright? I have no right to this <SEP> he thought <SEP> no more than to Ice <SEP> He twitched his burned fingers <SEP> feeling a throb of pain deep under the skin <SEP>  My lord <SEP> you honor me <SEP> but—
Spare me your but ’ s <SEP> boy <SEP>  Lord Mormont interrupted <SEP>  I would not be sitting here were it not for you and that beast of yours <SEP> You fought bravely … and more to the point <SEP> you thought quickly <SEP> Fire! Yes <SEP> damn it <SEP> We ought to have known <SEP> We ought to have remembered <SEP> The Long Night has come before <SEP> Oh <SEP> eight thousand years is a good while <SEP> to be sure … yet if the Night ’ s Watch does not remember <SEP> who will?
Who will <SEP>  chimed the talkative raven <SEP>  Who will <SEP>
Truly <SEP> the gods had heard Jon ’ s prayer that night; the fire had caught in the dead man ’ s clothing and consumed him as if his flesh were candle wax and his bones old dry wood <SEP> Jon had only to close his eyes to see the thing staggering across the solar <SEP> crashing against the furniture and flailing at the flames <SEP> It was the face that haunted him most; surrounded by a nimbus of fire <SEP> hair blazing like straw <SEP> the dead flesh melting away and sloughing off its skull to reveal the gleam of bone beneath <SEP>
Whatever demonic force moved Othor had been driven out by the flames; the twisted thing they had found in the ashes had been no more than cooked meat and charred bone <SEP> Yet in his nightmare he faced it again … and this time the burning corpse wore Lord Eddard ’ s features <SEP> It was his father ’ s skin that burst and blackened <SEP> his father ’ s eyes that ran liquid down his cheeks like jellied tears <SEP> Jon did not understand why that should be or what it might mean <SEP> but it frightened him more than he could say <SEP>
A sword ’ s small payment for a life <SEP>  Mormont concluded <SEP>  Take it <SEP> I ’ ll hear no more of it <SEP> is that understood?
Yes <SEP> my lord<SEP>  The soft leather gave beneath Jon ’ s fingers <SEP> as if the sword were molding itself to his grip already <SEP> He knew he should be honored <SEP> and he was <SEP> and yet …
He is not my father <SEP> The thought leapt unbidden to Jon ’ s mind <SEP> Lord Eddard Stark is my father <SEP> I will not forget him <SEP> no matter how many swords they give me <SEP> Yet he could scarcely tell Lord Mormont that it was another man ’ s sword he dreamt of …
I want no courtesies either <SEP>  Mormont said <SEP>  so thank me no thanks <SEP> Honor the steel with deeds <SEP> not words <SEP>
Jon nodded <SEP> <BOS> Does it have a name <SEP> my lord? <EOS>
It did <SEP> once <SEP> Longclaw <SEP> it was called <SEP>
Claw <SEP>  the raven cried <SEP>  Claw <SEP>
Jon tried a practice cut <SEP> He was clumsy and uncomfortable with his left hand <SEP> yet even so the steel seemed to flow through the air <SEP> as if it had a will of its own <SEP> <BOS> Longclaw is an apt name<SEP> Wolves have claws <SEP> as much as bears <SEP> <EOS>
The Old Bear seemed pleased by that <SEP>  I suppose they do <SEP> You ’ ll want to wear that over the shoulder <SEP> I imagine <SEP> It ’ s too long for the hip <SEP> at least until you ’ ve put on a few inches <SEP> And you ’ ll need to work at your two-handed strikes as well <SEP> Ser Endrew can show you some moves <SEP> when your burns have healed <SEP>
Ser Endrew?  Jon did not know the name <SEP>
Ser Endrew Tarth <SEP> a good man <SEP> He ’ s on his way from the Shadow Tower to assume the duties of master-at-arms <SEP> Ser Alliser Thorne left yestermorn for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea <SEP>
Jon lowered the sword <SEP> <BOS> Why? <EOS> he said <SEP> stupidly <SEP>
Mormont snorted <SEP>  Because I sent him <SEP> why do you think? He ’ s bringing the hand your Ghost tore off the end of Jafer Flowers ’ s wrist <SEP> I have commanded him to take ship to King ’ s Landing and lay it before this boy king <SEP> That should get young Joffrey ’ s attention <SEP> I ’ d think … and Ser Alliser ’ s a knight <SEP> highborn <SEP> anointed <SEP> with old friends at court <SEP> altogether harder to ignore than a glorified crow <SEP>
Crow<SEP>  Jon thought the raven sounded faintly indignant <SEP>
As well <SEP>  the Lord Commander continued <SEP> ignoring the bird ’ s protest <SEP>  it puts a thousand leagues twixt him and you without it seeming a rebuke<SEP>  He jabbed a finger up at Jon ’ s face <SEP>  And don ’ t think this means I approve of that nonsense in the common hall <SEP> Valor makes up for a fair amount of folly <SEP> but you ’ re not a boy anymore <SEP> however many years you ’ ve seen <SEP> That ’ s a man ’ s sword you have there <SEP> and it will take a man to wield her <SEP> I ’ ll expect you to act the part <SEP> henceforth <SEP>
Yes <SEP> my lord<SEP>  Jon slid the sword back into the silver-banded scabbard <SEP> If not the blade he would have chosen <SEP> it was nonetheless a noble gift <SEP> and freeing him from Alliser Thorne ’ s malignance was nobler still <SEP>
The Old Bear scratched at his chin <SEP>  I had forgotten how much a new beard itches <SEP>  he said <SEP>  Well <SEP> no help for that <SEP> Is that hand of yours healed enough to resume your duties?
Yes <SEP> my lord <SEP>
Good <SEP> The night will be cold <SEP> I ’ ll want hot spice wine <SEP> Find me a flagon of red <SEP> not too sour <SEP> and don ’ t skimp on the spices <SEP> And tell Hobb that if he sends me boiled mutton again I ’ m like to boil him <SEP> That last haunch was grey <SEP> Even the bird wouldn ’ t touch it<SEP>  He stroked the raven ’ s head with his thumb <SEP> and the bird made a contented quorking sound <SEP>  Away with you <SEP> I ’ ve work to do <SEP>
The guards smiled at him from their niches as he wound his way down the turret stair <SEP> carrying the sword in his good hand <SEP>  Sweet steel <SEP>  one man said <SEP>  You earned that <SEP> Snow <SEP>  another told him <SEP> Jon made himself smile back at them <SEP> but his heart was not in it <SEP> He knew he should be pleased <SEP> yet he did not feel it <SEP> His hand ached <SEP> and the taste of anger was in his mouth <SEP> though he could not have said who he was angry with or why <SEP>
A half dozen of his friends were lurking outside when he left the King ’ s Tower <SEP> where Lord Commander Mormont now made his residence <SEP> They ’ d hung a target on the granary doors <SEP> so they could seem to be honing their skills as archers <SEP> but he knew lurkers when he saw them <SEP> No sooner did he emerge than Pyp called out <SEP>  Well <SEP> come about <SEP> let ’ s have a look <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> <BOS> At what? <EOS>
Toad sidled close <SEP>  Your rosy butt cheeks <SEP> what else?
The sword <SEP>  Grenn stated <SEP>  We want to see the sword <SEP>
Jon raked them with an accusing look <SEP> <BOS> You knew <SEP> <EOS>
Pyp grinned <SEP>  We ’ re not all as dumb as Grenn <SEP>
You are so <SEP>  insisted Grenn <SEP>  You ’ re dumber <SEP>
Halder gave an apologetic shrug <SEP>  I helped Pate carve the stone for the pommel <SEP>  the builder said <SEP>  and your friend Sam bought the garnets in Mole ’ s Town <SEP>
We knew even before that <SEP> though <SEP>  Grenn said <SEP>  Rudge has been helping Donal Noye in the forge <SEP> He was there when the Old Bear brought him the burnt blade <SEP>
The sword!  Matt insisted <SEP> The others took up the chant <SEP>  The sword <SEP> the sword <SEP> the sword <SEP>
Jon unsheathed Longclaw and showed it to them <SEP> turning it this way and that so they could admire it <SEP> The bastard blade glittered in the pale sunlight <SEP> dark and deadly <SEP> <BOS> Valyrian steel <SEP> <EOS> he declared solemnly <SEP> trying to sound as pleased and proud as he ought to have felt <SEP>
I heard of a man who had a razor made of Valyrian steel <SEP>  declared Toad <SEP>  He cut his head off trying to shave <SEP>
Pyp grinned <SEP>  The Night ’ s Watch is thousands of years old <SEP>  he said <SEP>  but I ’ ll wager Lord Snow ’ s the first brother ever honored for burning down the Lord Commander ’ s Tower <SEP>
The others laughed <SEP> and even Jon had to smile <SEP> The fire he ’ d started had not <SEP> in truth <SEP> burned down that formidable stone tower <SEP> but it had done a fair job of gutting the interior of the top two floors <SEP> where the Old Bear had his chambers <SEP> No one seemed to mind that very much <SEP> since it had also destroyed Othor ’ s murderous corpse <SEP>
The other wight <SEP> the one-handed thing that had once been a ranger named Jafer Flowers <SEP> had also been destroyed <SEP> cut near to pieces by a dozen swords … but not before it had slain Ser Jaremy Rykker and four other men <SEP> Ser Jaremy had finished the job of hacking its head off <SEP> yet had died all the same when the headless corpse pulled his own dagger from its sheath and buried it in his bowels <SEP> Strength and courage did not avail much against foemen who would not fall because they were already dead; even arms and armor offered small protection <SEP>
That grim thought soured Jon ’ s fragile mood <SEP>  I need to see Hobb about the Old Bear ’ s supper <SEP>  he announced brusquely <SEP> sliding Longclaw back into its scabbard <SEP> His friends meant well <SEP> but they did not understand <SEP> It was not their fault <SEP> truly; they had not had to face Othor <SEP> they had not seen the pale glow of those dead blue eyes <SEP> had not felt the cold of those dead black fingers <SEP> Nor did they know of the fighting in the riverlands <SEP> How could they hope to comprehend? He turned away from them abruptly and strode off <SEP> sullen <SEP> Pyp called after him <SEP> but Jon paid him no mind <SEP>
They had moved him back to his old cell in tumbledown Hardin ’ s Tower after the fire <SEP> and it was there he returned <SEP> Ghost was curled up asleep beside the door <SEP> but he lifted his head at the sound of Jon ’ s boots <SEP> The direwolf ’ s red eyes were darker than garnets and wiser than men <SEP> Jon knelt <SEP> scratched his ear <SEP> and showed him the pommel of the sword <SEP>  Look <SEP> It ’ s you <SEP>
Ghost sniffed at his carved stone likeness and tried a lick <SEP> Jon smiled <SEP>  You ’ re the one deserves an honor <SEP>  he told the wolf … and suddenly he found himself remembering how he ’ d found him <SEP> that day in the late summer snow <SEP> They had been riding off with the other pups <SEP> but Jon had heard a noise and turned back <SEP> and there he was <SEP> white fur almost invisible against the drifts <SEP> He was all alone <SEP> he thought <SEP> apart from the others in the litter <SEP> He was different <SEP> so they drove him out <SEP>
Jon?  He looked up <SEP> Samwell Tarly stood rocking nervously on his heels <SEP> His cheeks were red <SEP> and he was wrapped in a heavy fur cloak that made him look ready for hibernation <SEP>
Sam<SEP>  Jon stood <SEP>  What is it? Do you want to see the sword?  If the others had known <SEP> no doubt Sam did too <SEP>
The fat boy shook his head <SEP>  I was heir to my father ’ s blade once <SEP>  he said mournfully <SEP>  Heartsbane <SEP> Lord Randyll let me hold it a few times <SEP> but it always scared me <SEP> It was Valyrian steel <SEP> beautiful but so sharp I was afraid I ’ d hurt one of my sisters <SEP> Dickon will have it now<SEP>  He wiped sweaty hands on his cloak <SEP>  I … ah … Maester Aemon wants to see you <SEP>
It was not time for his bandages to be changed <SEP> Jon frowned suspiciously <SEP>  Why?  he demanded <SEP> Sam looked miserable <SEP> That was answer enough <SEP>  You told him <SEP> didn ’ t you?  Jon said angrily <SEP>  You told him that you told me <SEP>
I … he … Jon <SEP> I didn ’ t want to … he asked … I mean … I think he knew <SEP> he sees things no one else sees …
Jon pointed out forcefully <SEP> disgusted <SEP> <BOS> He ’ s blind <SEP> I can find the way myself<SEP> <EOS> He left Sam standing there <SEP> openmouthed and quivering <SEP>
He found Maester Aemon up in the rookery <SEP> feeding the ravens <SEP> Clydas was with him <SEP> carrying a bucket of chopped meat as they shuffled from cage to cage <SEP>  Sam said you wanted me?
The maester nodded <SEP>  I did indeed <SEP> Clydas <SEP> give Jon the bucket <SEP> Perhaps he will be kind enough to assist me<SEP>  The hunched <SEP> pink-eyed brother handed Jon the bucket and scurried down the ladder <SEP>  Toss the meat into the cages <SEP>  Aemon instructed him <SEP>  The birds will do the rest <SEP>
Jon shifted the bucket to his right hand and thrust his left down into the bloody bits <SEP> The ravens began to scream noisily and fly at the bars <SEP> beating at the metal with night-black wings <SEP> The meat had been chopped into pieces no larger than a finger joint <SEP> He filled his fist and tossed the raw red morsels into the cage <SEP> and the squawking and squabbling grew hotter <SEP> Feathers flew as two of the larger birds fought over a choice piece <SEP> Quickly Jon grabbed a second handful and threw it in after the first <SEP> <BOS> Lord Mormont ’ s raven likes fruit and corn <SEP> <EOS>
He is a rare bird <SEP>  the maester said <SEP>  Most ravens will eat grain <SEP> but they prefer flesh <SEP> It makes them strong <SEP> and I fear they relish the taste of blood <SEP> In that they are like men … and like men <SEP> not all ravens are alike <SEP>
Jon had nothing to say to that <SEP> He threw meat <SEP> wondering why he ’ d been summoned <SEP> No doubt the old man would tell him <SEP> in his own good time <SEP> Maester Aemon was not a man to be hurried <SEP>
Doves and pigeons can also be trained to carry messages <SEP>  the maester went on <SEP>  though the raven is a stronger flyer <SEP> larger <SEP> bolder <SEP> far more clever <SEP> better able to defend itself against hawks … yet ravens are black <SEP> and they eat the dead <SEP> so some godly men abhor them <SEP> Baelor the Blessed tried to replace all the ravens with doves <SEP> did you know?  The maester turned his white eyes on Jon <SEP> smiling <SEP>  The Night ’ s Watch prefers ravens <SEP>
Jon ’ s fingers were in the bucket <SEP> blood up to the wrist <SEP> <BOS> Dywen says the wildlings call us crows <SEP> <EOS> he said uncertainly <SEP>
The crow is the raven ’ s poor cousin <SEP> They are both beggars in black <SEP> hated and misunderstood <SEP>
Jon wished he understood what they were talking about <SEP> and why <SEP> What did he care about ravens and doves? If the old man had something to say to him <SEP> why couldn ’ t he just say it?
Jon <SEP> did you ever wonder why the men of the Night ’ s Watch take no wives and father no children?  Maester Aemon asked <SEP>
Jon shrugged <SEP> <BOS> No<SEP> <EOS> He scattered more meat <SEP> The fingers of his left hand were slimy with blood <SEP> and his right throbbed from the weight of the bucket <SEP>
So they will not love <SEP>  the old man answered <SEP>  for love is the bane of honor <SEP> the death of duty <SEP>
That did not sound right to Jon <SEP> yet he said nothing <SEP> The maester was a hundred years old <SEP> and a high officer of the Night ’ s Watch; it was not his place to contradict him <SEP>
The old man seemed to sense his doubts <SEP>  Tell me <SEP> Jon <SEP> if the day should ever come when your lord father must needs choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other <SEP> what would he do?
Jon hesitated <SEP> He wanted to say that Lord Eddard would never dishonor himself <SEP> not even for love <SEP> yet inside a small sly voice whispered <SEP> He fathered a bastard <SEP> where was the honor in that? And your mother <SEP> what of his duty to her <SEP> he will not even say her name <SEP>  He would do whatever was right <SEP>  he said … ringingly <SEP> to make up for his hesitation <SEP>  No matter what <SEP>
Then Lord Eddard is a man in ten thousand <SEP> Most of us are not so strong <SEP> What is honor compared to a woman ’ s love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms … or the memory of a brother ’ s smile? Wind and words <SEP> Wind and words <SEP> We are only human <SEP> and the gods have fashioned us for love <SEP> That is our great glory <SEP> and our great tragedy <SEP>
The men who formed the Night ’ s Watch knew that only their courage shielded the realm from the darkness to the north <SEP> They knew they must have no divided loyalties to weaken their resolve <SEP> So they vowed they would have no wives nor children <SEP>
Yet brothers they had <SEP> and sisters <SEP> Mothers who gave them birth <SEP> fathers who gave them names <SEP> They came from a hundred quarrelsome kingdoms <SEP> and they knew times may change <SEP> but men do not <SEP> So they pledged as well that the Night ’ s Watch would take no part in the battles of the realms it guarded <SEP>
They kept their pledge <SEP> When Aegon slew Black Harren and claimed his kingdom <SEP> Harren ’ s brother was Lord Commander on the Wall <SEP> with ten thousand swords to hand <SEP> He did not march <SEP> In the days when the Seven Kingdoms were seven kingdoms <SEP> not a generation passed that three or four of them were not at war <SEP> The Watch took no part <SEP> When the Andals crossed the narrow sea and swept away the kingdoms of the First Men <SEP> the sons of the fallen kings held true to their vows and remained at their posts <SEP> So it has always been <SEP> for years beyond counting <SEP> Such is the price of honor <SEP>
A craven can be as brave as any man <SEP> when there is nothing to fear <SEP> And we all do our duty <SEP> when there is no cost to it <SEP> How easy it seems then <SEP> to walk the path of honor <SEP> Yet soon or late in every man ’ s life comes a day when it is not easy <SEP> a day when he must choose <SEP>
Some of the ravens were still eating <SEP> long stringy bits of meat dangling from their beaks <SEP> The rest seemed to be watching him <SEP> Jon could feel the weight of all those tiny black eyes <SEP>  And this is my day … is that what you ’ re saying?
Maester Aemon turned his head and looked at him with those dead white eyes <SEP> It was as if he were seeing right into his heart <SEP> Jon felt naked and exposed <SEP> He took the bucket in both hands and flung the rest of the slops through the bars <SEP> Strings of meat and blood flew everywhere <SEP> scattering the ravens <SEP> They took to the air <SEP> shrieking wildly <SEP> The quicker birds snatched morsels on the wing and gulped them down greedily <SEP> Jon let the empty bucket clang to the floor <SEP>
The old man laid a withered <SEP> spotted hand on his shoulder <SEP>  It hurts <SEP> boy <SEP>  he said softly <SEP>  Oh <SEP> yes <SEP> Choosing … it has always hurt <SEP> And always will <SEP> I know <SEP>
Jon said bitterly <SEP> <BOS> You don ’ t know <SEP> No one knows <SEP> Even if I am his bastard <SEP> he ’ s still my father … <EOS>
Maester Aemon sighed <SEP>  Have you heard nothing I ’ ve told you <SEP> Jon? Do you think you are the first?  He shook his ancient head <SEP> a gesture weary beyond words <SEP>  Three times the gods saw fit to test my vows <SEP> Once when I was a boy <SEP> once in the fullness of my manhood <SEP> and once when I had grown old <SEP> By then my strength was fled <SEP> my eyes grown dim <SEP> yet that last choice was as cruel as the first <SEP> My ravens would bring the news from the south <SEP> words darker than their wings <SEP> the ruin of my House <SEP> the death of my kin <SEP> disgrace and desolation <SEP> What could I have done <SEP> old <SEP> blind <SEP> frail? I was helpless as a suckling babe <SEP> yet still it grieved me to sit forgotten as they cut down my brother ’ s poor grandson <SEP> and his son <SEP> and even the little children …
Jon was shocked to see the shine of tears in the old man ’ s eyes <SEP> <BOS> Who are you? <EOS> he asked quietly <SEP> almost in dread <SEP>
A toothless smile quivered on the ancient lips <SEP>  Only a maester of the Citadel <SEP> bound in service to Castle Black and the Night ’ s Watch <SEP> In my order <SEP> we put aside our house names when we take our vows and don the collar<SEP>  The old man touched the maester ’ s chain that hung loosely around his thin <SEP> fleshless neck <SEP>  My father was Maekar <SEP> the First of his Name <SEP> and my brother Aegon reigned after him in my stead <SEP> My grandfather named me for Prince Aemon the Dragonknight <SEP> who was his uncle <SEP> or his father <SEP> depending on which tale you believe <SEP> Aemon <SEP> he called me …
Aemon … Targaryen?  Jon could scarcely believe it <SEP>
Once <SEP>  the old man said <SEP>  Once <SEP> So you see <SEP> Jon <SEP> I do know … and knowing <SEP> I will not tell you stay or go <SEP> You must make that choice yourself <SEP> and live with it all the rest of your days <SEP> As I have<SEP>  His voice fell to a whisper <SEP>  As I have …
The mare whickered softly as Jon Snow tightened the cinch <SEP>  Easy <SEP> sweet lady <SEP>  he said in a soft voice <SEP> quieting her with a touch <SEP> Wind whispered through the stable <SEP> a cold dead breath on his face <SEP> but Jon paid it no mind <SEP> He strapped his roll to the saddle <SEP> his scarred fingers stiff and clumsy <SEP>  Ghost <SEP>  he called softly <SEP>  to me<SEP>  And the wolf was there <SEP> eyes like embers <SEP>
Jon <SEP> please <SEP> You must not do this <SEP>
He mounted <SEP> the reins in his hand <SEP> and wheeled the horse around to face the night <SEP> Samwell Tarly stood in the stable door <SEP> a full moon peering over his shoulder <SEP> He threw a giant ’ s shadow <SEP> immense and black <SEP>  Get out of my way <SEP> Sam <SEP>
Jon <SEP> you can ’ t <SEP>  Sam said <SEP>  I won ’ t let you <SEP>
Jon told him <SEP> <BOS> I would sooner not hurt you <SEP> Move aside <SEP> Sam <SEP> or I ’ ll ride you down <SEP> <EOS>
You won ’ t <SEP> You have to listen to me <SEP> Please …
Jon put his spurs to horseflesh <SEP> and the mare bolted for the door <SEP> For an instant Sam stood his ground <SEP> his face as round and pale as the moon behind him <SEP> his mouth a widening O of surprise <SEP> At the last moment <SEP> when they were almost on him <SEP> he jumped aside as Jon had known he would <SEP> stumbled <SEP> and fell <SEP> The mare leapt over him <SEP> out into the night <SEP>
Jon raised the hood of his heavy cloak and gave the horse her head <SEP> Castle Black was silent and still as he rode out <SEP> with Ghost racing at his side <SEP> Men watched from the Wall behind him <SEP> he knew <SEP> but their eyes were turned north <SEP> not south <SEP> No one would see him go <SEP> no one but Sam Tarly <SEP> struggling back to his feet in the dust of the old stables <SEP> He hoped Sam hadn ’ t hurt himself <SEP> falling like that <SEP> He was so heavy and so ungainly <SEP> it would be just like him to break a wrist or twist his ankle getting out of the way <SEP> Jon said aloud <SEP> <BOS> I warned him <SEP> It was nothing to do with him <SEP> anyway<SEP> <EOS> He flexed his burned hand as he rode <SEP> opening and closing the scarred fingers <SEP> They still pained him <SEP> but it felt good to have the wrappings off <SEP>
Moonlight silvered the hills as he followed the twisting ribbon of the kingsroad <SEP> He needed to get as far from the Wall as he could before they realized he was gone <SEP> On the morrow he would leave the road and strike out overland through field and bush and stream to throw off pursuit <SEP> but for the moment speed was more important than deception <SEP> It was not as though they would not guess where he was going <SEP>
The Old Bear was accustomed to rise at first light <SEP> so Jon had until dawn to put as many leagues as he could between him and the Wall … if Sam Tarly did not betray him <SEP> The fat boy was dutiful and easily frightened <SEP> but he loved Jon like a brother <SEP> If questioned <SEP> Sam would doubtless tell them the truth <SEP> but Jon could not imagine him braving the guards in front of the King ’ s Tower to wake Mormont from sleep <SEP>
When Jon did not appear to fetch the Old Bear ’ s breakfast from the kitchen <SEP> they ’ d look in his cell and find Longclaw on the bed <SEP> It had been hard to abandon it <SEP> but Jon was not so lost to honor as to take it with him <SEP> Even Jorah Mormont had not done that <SEP> when he fled in disgrace <SEP> Doubtless Lord Mormont would find someone more worthy of the blade <SEP> Jon felt bad when he thought of the old man <SEP> He knew his desertion would be salt in the still-raw wound of his son ’ s disgrace <SEP> That seemed a poor way to repay him for his trust <SEP> but it couldn ’ t be helped <SEP> No matter what he did <SEP> Jon felt as though he were betraying someone <SEP>
Even now <SEP> he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing <SEP> The southron had it easier <SEP> They had their septons to talk to <SEP> someone to tell them the gods ’ will and help sort out right from wrong <SEP> But the Starks worshiped the old gods <SEP> the nameless gods <SEP> and if the heart trees heard <SEP> they did not speak <SEP>
When the last lights of Castle Black vanished behind him <SEP> Jon slowed his mare to a walk <SEP> He had a long journey ahead and only the one horse to see him through <SEP> There were holdfasts and farming villages along the road south where he might be able to trade the mare for a fresh mount when he needed one <SEP> but not if she were injured or blown <SEP>
He would need to find new clothes soon; most like <SEP> he ’ d need to steal them <SEP> He was clad in black from head to heel; high leather riding boots <SEP> roughspun breeches and tunic <SEP> sleeveless leather jerkin <SEP> and heavy wool cloak <SEP> His longsword and dagger were sheathed in black moleskin <SEP> and the hauberk and coif in his saddlebag were black ringmail <SEP> Any bit of it could mean his death if he were taken <SEP> A stranger wearing black was viewed with cold suspicion in every village and holdfast north of the Neck <SEP> and men would soon be watching for him <SEP> Once Maester Aemon ’ s ravens took flight <SEP> Jon knew he would find no safe haven <SEP> Not even at Winterfell <SEP> Bran might want to let him in <SEP> but Maester Luwin had better sense <SEP> He would bar the gates and send Jon away <SEP> as he should <SEP> Better not to call there at all <SEP>
Yet he saw the castle clear in his mind ’ s eye <SEP> as if he had left it only yesterday; the towering granite walls <SEP> the Great Hall with its smells of smoke and dog and roasting meat <SEP> his father ’ s solar <SEP> the turret room where he had slept <SEP> Part of him wanted nothing so much as to hear Bran laugh again <SEP> to sup on one of Gage ’ s beef-and-bacon pies <SEP> to listen to Old Nan tell her tales of the children of the forest and Florian the Fool <SEP>
But he had not left the Wall for that; he had left because he was after all his father ’ s son <SEP> and Robb ’ s brother <SEP> The gift of a sword <SEP> even a sword as fine as Longclaw <SEP> did not make him a Mormont <SEP> Nor was he Aemon Targaryen <SEP> Three times the old man had chosen <SEP> and three times he had chosen honor <SEP> but that was him <SEP> Even now <SEP> Jon could not decide whether the maester had stayed because he was weak and craven <SEP> or because he was strong and true <SEP> Yet he understood what the old man had meant <SEP> about the pain of choosing; he understood that all too well <SEP>
Tyrion Lannister had claimed that most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it <SEP> but Jon was done with denials <SEP> He was who he was; Jon Snow <SEP> bastard and oathbreaker <SEP> motherless <SEP> friendless <SEP> and damned <SEP> For the rest of his life—however long that might be—he would be condemned to be an outsider <SEP> the silent man standing in the shadows who dares not speak his true name <SEP> Wherever he might go throughout the Seven Kingdoms <SEP> he would need to live a lie <SEP> lest every man ’ s hand be raised against him <SEP> But it made no matter <SEP> so long as he lived long enough to take his place by his brother ’ s side and help avenge his father <SEP>
He remembered Robb as he had last seen him <SEP> standing in the yard with snow melting in his auburn hair <SEP> Jon would have to come to him in secret <SEP> disguised <SEP> He tried to imagine the look on Robb ’ s face when he revealed himself <SEP> His brother would shake his head and smile <SEP> and he ’ d say … he ’ d say …
He could not see the smile <SEP> Hard as he tried <SEP> he could not see it <SEP> He found himself thinking of the deserter his father had beheaded the day they ’ d found the direwolves <SEP>  You said the words <SEP>  Lord Eddard had told him <SEP>  You took a vow <SEP> before your brothers <SEP> before the old gods and the new<SEP>  Desmond and Fat Tom had dragged the man to the stump <SEP> Bran ’ s eyes had been wide as saucers <SEP> and Jon had to remind him to keep his pony in hand <SEP> He remembered the look on Father ’ s face when Theon Greyjoy brought forth Ice <SEP> the spray of blood on the snow <SEP> the way Theon had kicked the head when it came rolling at his feet <SEP>
He wondered what Lord Eddard might have done if the deserter had been his brother Benjen instead of that ragged stranger <SEP> Would it have been any different? It must <SEP> surely <SEP> surely … and Robb would welcome him <SEP> for a certainty <SEP> He had to <SEP> or else …
It did not bear thinking about <SEP> Pain throbbed <SEP> deep in his fingers <SEP> as he clutched the reins <SEP> Jon put his heels into his horse and broke into a gallop <SEP> racing down the kingsroad <SEP> as if to outrun his doubts <SEP> Jon was not afraid of death <SEP> but he did not want to die like that <SEP> trussed and bound and beheaded like a common brigand <SEP> If he must perish <SEP> let it be with a sword in his hand <SEP> fighting his father ’ s killers <SEP> He was no true Stark <SEP> had never been one … but he could die like one <SEP> Let them say that Eddard Stark had fathered four sons <SEP> not three <SEP>
Ghost kept pace with them for almost half a mile <SEP> red tongue lolling from his mouth <SEP> Man and horse alike lowered their heads as he asked the mare for more speed <SEP> The wolf slowed <SEP> stopped <SEP> watching <SEP> his eyes glowing red in the moonlight <SEP> He vanished behind <SEP> but Jon knew he would follow <SEP> at his own pace <SEP>
Scattered lights flickered through the trees ahead of him <SEP> on both sides of the road: Mole ’ s Town <SEP> A dog barked as he rode through <SEP> and he heard a mule ’ s raucous haw from the stable <SEP> but otherwise the village was still <SEP> Here and there the glow of hearth fires shone through shuttered windows <SEP> leaking between wooden slats <SEP> but only a few <SEP>
Mole ’ s Town was bigger than it seemed <SEP> but three quarters of it was under the ground <SEP> in deep warm cellars connected by a maze of tunnels <SEP> Even the whorehouse was down there <SEP> nothing on the surface but a wooden shack no bigger than a privy <SEP> with a red lantern hung over the door <SEP> On the Wall <SEP> he ’ d heard men call the whores  buried treasures<SEP>  He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down there tonight <SEP> mining <SEP> That was oathbreaking too <SEP> yet no one seemed to care <SEP>
Not until he was well beyond the village did Jon slow again <SEP> By then both he and the mare were damp with sweat <SEP> He dismounted <SEP> shivering <SEP> his burned hand aching <SEP> A bank of melting snow lay under the trees <SEP> bright in the moonlight <SEP> water trickling off to form small shallow pools <SEP> Jon squatted and brought his hands together <SEP> cupping the runoff between his fingers <SEP> The snowmelt was icy cold <SEP> He drank <SEP> and splashed some on his face <SEP> until his cheeks tingled <SEP> His fingers were throbbing worse than they had in days <SEP> and his head was pounding too <SEP> I am doing the right thing <SEP> he told himself <SEP> so why do I feel so bad?
The horse was well lathered <SEP> so Jon took the lead and walked her for a while <SEP> The road was scarcely wide enough for two riders to pass abreast <SEP> its surface cut by tiny streams and littered with stone <SEP> That run had been truly stupid <SEP> an invitation to a broken neck <SEP> Jon wondered what had gotten into him <SEP> Was he in such a great rush to die?
Off in the trees <SEP> the distant scream of some frightened animal made him look up <SEP> His mare whinnied nervously <SEP> Had his wolf found some prey? He cupped his hands around his mouth <SEP>  Ghost!  he shouted <SEP>  Ghost <SEP> to me<SEP>  The only answer was a rush of wings behind him as an owl took flight <SEP>
Frowning <SEP> Jon continued on his way <SEP> He led the mare for half an hour <SEP> until she was dry <SEP> Ghost did not appear <SEP> Jon wanted to mount up and ride again <SEP> but he was concerned about his missing wolf <SEP>  Ghost <SEP>  he called again <SEP>  Where are you? To me! Ghost!  Nothing in these woods could trouble a direwolf <SEP> even a half-grown direwolf <SEP> unless … no <SEP> Ghost was too smart to attack a bear <SEP> and if there was a wolf pack anywhere close Jon would have surely heard them howling <SEP>
He should eat <SEP> he decided <SEP> Food would settle his stomach and give Ghost the chance to catch up <SEP> There was no danger yet; Castle Black still slept <SEP> In his saddlebag <SEP> he found a biscuit <SEP> a piece of cheese <SEP> and a small withered brown apple <SEP> He ’ d brought salt beef as well <SEP> and a rasher of bacon he ’ d filched from the kitchens <SEP> but he would save the meat for the morrow <SEP> After it was gone he ’ d need to hunt <SEP> and that would slow him <SEP>
Jon sat under the trees and ate his biscuit and cheese while his mare grazed along the kingsroad <SEP> He kept the apple for last <SEP> It had gone a little soft <SEP> but the flesh was still tart and juicy <SEP> He was down to the core when he heard the sounds: horses <SEP> and from the north <SEP> Quickly Jon leapt up and strode to his mare <SEP> Could he outrun them? No <SEP> they were too close <SEP> they ’ d hear him for a certainty <SEP> and if they were from Castle Black …
He led the mare off the road <SEP> behind a thick stand of grey-green sentinels <SEP>  Quiet now <SEP>  he said in a hushed voice <SEP> crouching down to peer through the branches <SEP> If the gods were kind <SEP> the riders would pass by <SEP> Likely as not <SEP> they were only smallfolk from Mole ’ s Town <SEP> farmers on their way to their fields <SEP> although what they were doing out in the middle of the night …
He listened to the sound of hooves growing steadily louder as they trotted briskly down the kingsroad <SEP> From the sound <SEP> there were five or six of them at the least <SEP> Their voices drifted through the trees <SEP>
… certain he came this way?
We can ’ t be certain <SEP>
He could have ridden east <SEP> for all you know <SEP> Or left the road to cut through the woods <SEP> That ’ s what I ’ d do <SEP>
In the dark? Stupid <SEP> If you didn ’ t fall off your horse and break your neck <SEP> you ’ d get lost and wind up back at the Wall when the sun came up <SEP>
I would not<SEP>  Grenn sounded peeved <SEP>  I ’ d just ride south <SEP> you can tell south by the stars <SEP>
What if the sky was cloudy?  Pyp asked <SEP>
Then I wouldn ’ t go <SEP>
Another voice broke in <SEP>  You know where I ’ d be if it was me? I ’ d be in Mole ’ s Town <SEP> digging for buried treasure<SEP>  Toad ’ s shrill laughter boomed through the trees <SEP> Jon ’ s mare snorted <SEP>
Keep quiet <SEP> all of you <SEP>  Halder said <SEP>  I thought I heard something <SEP>
Where? I didn ’ t hear anything<SEP>  The horses stopped <SEP>
You can ’ t hear yourself fart <SEP>
I can too <SEP>  Grenn insisted <SEP>
Quiet!
They all fell silent <SEP> listening <SEP> Jon found himself holding his breath <SEP> Sam <SEP> he thought <SEP> He hadn ’ t gone to the Old Bear <SEP> but he hadn ’ t gone to bed either <SEP> he ’ d woken the other boys <SEP> Damn them all <SEP> Come dawn <SEP> if they were not in their beds <SEP> they ’ d be named deserters too <SEP> What did they think they were doing?
The hushed silence seemed to stretch on and on <SEP> From where Jon crouched <SEP> he could see the legs of their horses through the branches <SEP> Finally Pyp spoke up <SEP>  What did you hear?
I don ’ t know <SEP>  Halder admitted <SEP>  A sound <SEP> I thought it might have been a horse but …
There ’ s nothing here <SEP>
Out of the corner of his eye <SEP> Jon glimpsed a pale shape moving through the trees <SEP> Leaves rustled <SEP> and Ghost came bounding out of the shadows <SEP> so suddenly that Jon ’ s mare started and gave a whinny <SEP>  There!  Halder shouted <SEP>
I heard it too!
Jon told the direwolf as he swung up into the saddle <SEP> He turned the mare ’ s head to slide off through the trees <SEP> but they were on him before he had gone ten feet <SEP> <BOS> Traitor <SEP> <EOS>
Jon!  Pyp shouted after him <SEP>
Pull up <SEP>  Grenn said <SEP>  You can ’ t outrun us all <SEP>
Jon wheeled around to face them <SEP> drawing his sword <SEP> <BOS> Get back <SEP> I don ’ t wish to hurt you <SEP> but I will if I have to <SEP> <EOS>
One against seven?  Halder gave a signal <SEP> The boys spread out <SEP> surrounding him <SEP>
Jon demanded <SEP> <BOS> What do you want with me? <EOS>
We want to take you back where you belong <SEP>  Pyp said <SEP>
I belong with my brother <SEP>
We ’ re your brothers now <SEP>  Grenn said <SEP>
They ’ ll cut off your head if they catch you <SEP> you know <SEP>  Toad put in with a nervous laugh <SEP>  This is so stupid <SEP> it ’ s like something the Aurochs would do <SEP>
I would not <SEP>  Grenn said <SEP>  I ’ m no oathbreaker <SEP> I said the words and I meant them <SEP>
Jon told them <SEP> <BOS> So did I <SEP> Don ’ t you understand? They murdered my father <SEP> It ’ s war <SEP> my brother Robb is fighting in the riverlands— <EOS>
We know <SEP>  said Pyp solemnly <SEP>  Sam told us everything <SEP>
We ’ re sorry about your father <SEP>  Grenn said <SEP>  but it doesn ’ t matter <SEP> Once you say the words <SEP> you can ’ t leave <SEP> no matter what <SEP>
Jon said fervently <SEP> <BOS> I have to <SEP> <EOS>
You said the words <SEP>  Pyp reminded him <SEP>  Now my watch begins <SEP> you said it <SEP> It shall not end until my death <SEP>
I shall live and die at my post <SEP>  Grenn added <SEP> nodding <SEP>
You don ’ t have to tell me the words <SEP> I know them as well as you do<SEP>  He was angry now <SEP> Why couldn ’ t they let him go in peace? They were only making it harder <SEP>
I am the sword in the darkness <SEP>  Halder intoned <SEP>
The watcher on the walls <SEP>  piped Toad <SEP>
Jon cursed them all to their faces <SEP> They took no notice <SEP> Pyp spurred his horse closer <SEP> reciting <SEP> <BOS> I am the fire that burns against the cold <SEP> the light that brings the dawn <SEP> the horn that wakes the sleepers <SEP> the shield that guards the realms of men <SEP> <EOS>
Jon warned him <SEP> brandishing his sword <SEP> <BOS> Stay back <SEP> I mean it <SEP> Pyp<SEP> <EOS> They weren ’ t even wearing armor <SEP> he could cut them to pieces if he had to <SEP>
Matthar had circled behind him <SEP> He joined the chorus <SEP>  I pledge my life and honor to the Night ’ s Watch <SEP>
Jon kicked his mare <SEP> spinning her in a circle <SEP> The boys were all around him now <SEP> closing from every side <SEP>
For this night … <SEP>  Halder trotted in from the left <SEP>
… and all the nights to come <SEP>  finished Pyp <SEP> He reached over for Jon ’ s reins <SEP>  So here are your choices <SEP> Kill me <SEP> or come back with me <SEP>
Jon lifted his sword … and lowered it <SEP> helpless <SEP>  Damn you <SEP>  he said <SEP>  Damn you all <SEP>
Do we have to bind your hands <SEP> or will you give us your word you ’ ll ride back peaceful?  asked Halder <SEP>
I won ’ t run <SEP> if that ’ s what you mean<SEP>  Ghost moved out from under the trees and Jon glared at him <SEP>  Small help you were <SEP>  he said <SEP> The deep red eyes looked at him knowingly <SEP>
We had best hurry <SEP>  Pyp said <SEP>  If we ’ re not back before first light <SEP> the Old Bear will have all our heads <SEP>
Of the ride back <SEP> Jon Snow remembered little <SEP> It seemed shorter than the journey south <SEP> perhaps because his mind was elsewhere <SEP> Pyp set the pace <SEP> galloping <SEP> walking <SEP> trotting <SEP> and then breaking into another gallop <SEP> Mole ’ s Town came and went <SEP> the red lantern over the brothel long extinguished <SEP> They made good time <SEP> Dawn was still an hour off when Jon glimpsed the towers of Castle Black ahead of them <SEP> dark against the pale immensity of the Wall <SEP> It did not seem like home this time <SEP>
They could take him back <SEP> Jon told himself <SEP> but they could not make him stay <SEP> The war would not end on the morrow <SEP> or the day after <SEP> and his friends could not watch him day and night <SEP> He would bide his time <SEP> make them think he was content to remain here … and then <SEP> when they had grown lax <SEP> he would be off again <SEP> Next time he would avoid the kingsroad <SEP> He could follow the Wall east <SEP> perhaps all the way to the sea <SEP> a longer route but a safer one <SEP> Or even west <SEP> to the mountains <SEP> and then south over the high passes <SEP> That was the wildling ’ s way <SEP> hard and perilous <SEP> but at least no one would follow him <SEP> He wouldn ’ t stray within a hundred leagues of Winterfell or the kingsroad <SEP>
Samwell Tarly awaited them in the old stables <SEP> slumped on the ground against a bale of hay <SEP> too anxious to sleep <SEP> He rose and brushed himself off <SEP>  I … I ’ m glad they found you <SEP> Jon <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> dismounting <SEP> <BOS> I ’ m not <SEP> <EOS>
Pyp hopped off his horse and looked at the lightening sky with disgust <SEP>  Give us a hand bedding down the horses <SEP> Sam <SEP>  the small boy said <SEP>  We have a long day before us <SEP> and no sleep to face it on <SEP> thanks to Lord Snow <SEP>
When day broke <SEP> Jon walked to the kitchens as he did every dawn <SEP> Three-Finger Hobb said nothing as he gave him the Old Bear ’ s breakfast <SEP> Today it was three brown eggs boiled hard <SEP> with fried bread and ham steak and a bowl of wrinkled plums <SEP> Jon carried the food back to the King ’ s Tower <SEP> He found Mormont at the window seat <SEP> writing <SEP> His raven was walking back and forth across his shoulders <SEP> muttering <SEP>  Corn <SEP> corn <SEP> corn<SEP>  The bird shrieked when Jon entered <SEP>  Put the food on the table <SEP>  the Old Bear said <SEP> glancing up <SEP>  I ’ ll have some beer <SEP>
Jon opened a shuttered window <SEP> took the flagon of beer off the outside ledge <SEP> and filled a horn <SEP> Hobb had given him a lemon <SEP> still cold from the Wall <SEP> Jon crushed it in his fist <SEP> The juice trickled through his fingers <SEP> Mormont drank lemon in his beer every day <SEP> and claimed that was why he still had his own teeth <SEP>
Doubtless you loved your father <SEP>  Mormont said when Jon brought him his horn <SEP>  The things we love destroy us every time <SEP> lad <SEP> Remember when I told you that?
Jon said sullenly <SEP> He did not care to talk of his father ’ s death <SEP> not even to Mormont <SEP> <BOS> I remember <SEP> <EOS>
See that you never forget it <SEP> The hard truths are the ones to hold tight <SEP> Fetch me my plate <SEP> Is it ham again? So be it <SEP> You look weary <SEP> Was your moonlight ride so tiring?
Jon ’ s throat was dry <SEP> <BOS> You know? <EOS>
Know <SEP>  the raven echoed from Mormont ’ s shoulder <SEP>  Know <SEP>
The Old Bear snorted <SEP>  Do you think they chose me Lord Commander of the Night ’ s Watch because I ’ m dumb as a stump <SEP> Snow? Aemon told me you ’ d go <SEP> I told him you ’ d be back <SEP> I know my men … and my boys too <SEP> Honor set you on the kingsroad … and honor brought you back <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> <BOS> My friends brought me back <SEP> <EOS>
Did I say it was your honor?  Mormont inspected his plate <SEP>
They killed my father <SEP> Did you expect me to do nothing?
If truth be told <SEP> we expected you to do just as you did<SEP>  Mormont tried a plum <SEP> spit out the pit <SEP>  I ordered a watch kept over you <SEP> You were seen leaving <SEP> If your brothers had not fetched you back <SEP> you would have been taken along the way <SEP> and not by friends <SEP> Unless you have a horse with wings like a raven <SEP> Do you?
Jon felt like a fool <SEP> <BOS> No<SEP> <EOS>
Pity <SEP> we could use a horse like that <SEP>
Jon stood tall <SEP> He told himself that he would die well; that much he could do <SEP> at the least <SEP> <BOS> I know the penalty for desertion <SEP> my lord <SEP> I ’ m not afraid to die <SEP> <EOS>
Die!  the raven cried <SEP>
Nor live <SEP> I hope <SEP>  Mormont said <SEP> cutting his ham with a dagger and feeding a bite to the bird <SEP>  You have not deserted—yet <SEP> Here you stand <SEP> If we beheaded every boy who rode to Mole ’ s Town in the night <SEP> only ghosts would guard the Wall <SEP> Yet maybe you mean to flee again on the morrow <SEP> or a fortnight from now <SEP> Is that it? Is that your hope <SEP> boy?
Jon kept silent <SEP>
I thought so<SEP>  Mormont peeled the shell off a boiled egg <SEP>  Your father is dead <SEP> lad <SEP> Do you think you can bring him back?
No <SEP>  he answered <SEP> sullen <SEP>
Good <SEP>  Mormont said <SEP>  We ’ ve seen the dead come back <SEP> you and me <SEP> and it ’ s not something I care to see again<SEP>  He ate the egg in two bites and flicked a bit of shell out from between his teeth <SEP>  Your brother is in the field with all the power of the north behind him <SEP> Any one of his lords bannermen commands more swords than you ’ ll find in all the Night ’ s Watch <SEP> Why do you imagine that they need your help? Are you such a mighty warrior <SEP> or do you carry a grumkin in your pocket to magic up your sword?
Jon had no answer for him <SEP> The raven was pecking at an egg <SEP> breaking the shell <SEP> Pushing his beak through the hole <SEP> he pulled out morsels of white and yoke <SEP>
The Old Bear sighed <SEP>  You are not the only one touched by this war <SEP> Like as not <SEP> my sister is marching in your brother ’ s host <SEP> her and those daughters of hers <SEP> dressed in men ’ s mail <SEP> Maege is a hoary old snark <SEP> stubborn <SEP> short-tempered <SEP> and willful <SEP> Truth be told <SEP> I can hardly stand to be around the wretched woman <SEP> but that does not mean my love for her is any less than the love you bear your half sisters<SEP>  Frowning <SEP> Mormont took his last egg and squeezed it in his fist until the shell crunched <SEP>  Or perhaps it does <SEP> Be that as it may <SEP> I ’ d still grieve if she were slain <SEP> yet you don ’ t see me running off <SEP> I said the words <SEP> just as you did <SEP> My place is here … where is yours <SEP> boy?
I have no place <SEP> Jon wanted to say <SEP> I ’ m a bastard <SEP> I have no rights <SEP> no name <SEP> no mother <SEP> and now not even a father <SEP> The words would not come <SEP>  I don ’ t know <SEP>
I do <SEP>  said Lord Commander Mormont <SEP>  The cold winds are rising <SEP> Snow <SEP> Beyond the Wall <SEP> the shadows lengthen <SEP> Cotter Pyke writes of vast herds of elk <SEP> streaming south and east toward the sea <SEP> and mammoths as well <SEP> He says one of his men discovered huge <SEP> misshapen footprints not three leagues from Eastwatch <SEP> Rangers from the Shadow Tower have found whole villages abandoned <SEP> and at night Ser Denys says they see fires in the mountains <SEP> huge blazes that burn from dusk till dawn <SEP> Quorin Halfhand took a captive in the depths of the Gorge <SEP> and the man swears that Mance Rayder is massing all his people in some new <SEP> secret stronghold he ’ s found <SEP> to what end the gods only know <SEP> Do you think your uncle Benjen was the only ranger we ’ ve lost this past year?
Ben Jen <SEP>  the raven squawked <SEP> bobbing its head <SEP> bits of egg dribbling from its beak <SEP>  Ben Jen <SEP> Ben Jen <SEP>
Jon said <SEP> There had been others <SEP> Too many <SEP> <BOS> No <SEP> <EOS>
Do you think your brother ’ s war is more important than ours?  the old man barked <SEP>
Jon chewed his lip <SEP> The raven flapped its wings at him <SEP> <BOS> War <SEP> war <SEP> war <SEP> war <SEP> <EOS> it sang <SEP>
It ’ s not <SEP>  Mormont told him <SEP>  Gods save us <SEP> boy <SEP> you ’ re not blind and you ’ re not stupid <SEP> When dead men come hunting in the night <SEP> do you think it matters who sits the Iron Throne?
No<SEP>  Jon had not thought of it that way <SEP>
Your lord father sent you to us <SEP> Jon <SEP> Why <SEP> who can say?
Why? Why? Why?  the raven called <SEP>
All I know is that the blood of the First Men flows in the veins of the Starks <SEP> The First Men built the Wall <SEP> and it ’ s said they remember things otherwise forgotten <SEP> And that beast of yours … he led us to the wights <SEP> warned you of the dead man on the steps <SEP> Ser Jaremy would doubtless call that happenstance <SEP> yet Ser Jaremy is dead and I ’ m not<SEP>  Lord Mormont stabbed a chunk of ham with the point of his dagger <SEP>  I think you were meant to be here <SEP> and I want you and that wolf of yours with us when we go beyond the Wall <SEP>
His words sent a chill of excitement down Jon ’ s back <SEP>  Beyond the Wall?
You heard me <SEP> I mean to find Ben Stark <SEP> alive or dead<SEP>  He chewed and swallowed <SEP>  I will not sit here meekly and wait for the snows and the ice winds <SEP> We must know what is happening <SEP> This time the Night ’ s Watch will ride in force <SEP> against the King-beyond-the-Wall <SEP> the Others <SEP> and anything else that may be out there <SEP> I mean to command them myself<SEP>  He pointed his dagger at Jon ’ s chest <SEP>  By custom <SEP> the Lord Commander ’ s steward is his squire as well … but I do not care to wake every dawn wondering if you ’ ve run off again <SEP> So I will have an answer from you <SEP> Lord Snow <SEP> and I will have it now <SEP> Are you a brother of the Night ’ s Watch … or only a bastard boy who wants to play at war?
Jon Snow straightened himself and took a long deep breath <SEP> Forgive me <SEP> Father <SEP> Robb <SEP> Arya <SEP> Bran … forgive me <SEP> I cannot help you <SEP> He has the truth of it <SEP> This is my place <SEP> <BOS> I am … yours <SEP> my lord <SEP> Your man <SEP> I swear it <SEP> I will not run again <SEP> <EOS>
The Old Bear snorted <SEP>  Good <SEP> Now go put on your sword <SEP>
