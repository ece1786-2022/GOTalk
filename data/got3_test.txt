Har! said Tormund . Well, I never had much use for Styr . When a man ' s got no beard nor hair nor ears, you can ' t get a good grip on him when you fight . He kept his horse at a slow walk so Jon could limp beside him . What happened to that leg?An arrow . One of Ygritte ' s, I think.That ' s a woman for you . One day she ' s kissing you, the next she ' s filling you with arrows.She ' s dead.Aye? Tormund gave a sad shake of the head . A waste . If I ' d been ten years younger, I ' d have stolen her meself . That hair she had . Well, the hottest fires burn out quickest . He lifted the skin of mead . To Ygritte, kissed by fire! He drank deep.Jon repeated when Tormund handed him back the skin . He drank even deeper . <|endoftext|> To Ygritte, kissed by fire, <|endoftext|>Was it you killed her?My brother . Jon had never learned which one, and hoped he never would.You bloody crows . Tormund ' s tone was gruff, yet strangely gentle . That Longspear stole me daughter . Munda, me little autumn apple . Took her right out o ' my tent with all four o ' her brothers about . Toregg slept through it, the great lout, and Torwynd . . . well, Torwynd the Tame, that says all that needs saying, don ' t it? The young ones gave the lad a fight, though.And Munda? asked Jon.She ' s my own blood, said Tormund proudly . She broke his lip for him and bit one ear half off, and I hear he ' s got so many scratches on his back he can ' t wear a cloak . She likes him well enough, though . And why not? He don ' t fight with no spear, you know . Never has . So where do you think he got that name? Har!Jon had to laugh . Even now, even here . Ygritte had been fond of Longspear Ryk . He hoped he found some joy with Tormund ' s Munda . Someone needed to find some joy somewhere.You know nothing, Jon Snow, Ygritte would have told him . I know that I am going to die, he thought . I know that much, at least . All men die, he could almost hear her say, and women too, and every beast that flies or swims or runs . It ' s not the when o ' dying that matters, it ' s the how of it, Jon Snow . Easy for you to say, he thought back . You died brave in battle, storming the castle of a foe . I ' m going to die a turncloak and a killer . Nor would his death be quick, unless it came on the end of Mance ' s sword.Soon they were among the tents . It was the usual wildling camp; a sprawling jumble of cookfires and piss pits, children and goats wandering freely, sheep bleating among the trees, horse hides pegged up to dry . There was no plan to it, no order, no defenses . But there were men and women and animals everywhere.Many ignored him, but for every one who went about his business there were ten who stopped to stare; children squatting by the fires, old women in dog carts, cave dwellers with painted faces, raiders with claws and snakes and severed heads painted on their shields, all turned to have a look . Jon saw spearwives too, their long hair streaming in the piney wind that sighed between the trees.There were no true hills here, but Mance Rayder ' s white fur tent had been raised on a spot of high stony ground right on the edge of the trees . The King-beyond-the-Wall was waiting outside, his ragged red-and-black cloak blowing in the wind . Harma Dogshead was with him, Jon saw, back from her raids and feints along the Wall, and Varamyr Sixskins as well, attended by his shadowcat and two lean grey wolves.When they saw who the Watch had sent, Harma turned her head and spat, and one of Varamyr ' s wolves bared its teeth and growled . You must be very brave or very stupid, Jon Snow, Mance Rayder said, to come back to us wearing a black cloak.What else would a man of the Night ' s Watch wear?Kill him, urged Harma . Send his body back up in that cage o ' theirs and tell them to send us someone else . I ' ll keep his head for my standard . A turncloak ' s worse than a dog.I warned you he was false . Varamyr ' s tone was mild, but his shadow-cat was staring at Jon hungrily through slitted grey eyes . I never did like the smell o ' him.Pull in your claws, beastling . Tormund Giantsbane swung down off his horse . The lad ' s here to hear . You lay a paw on him, might be I ' ll take me that shadowskin cloak I been wanting.Tormund Crowlover, Harma sneered . You are a great sack o ' wind, old man.The skinchanger was grey-faced, round-shouldered, and bald, a mouse of a man with a wolfling ' s eyes . Once a horse is broken to the saddle, any man can mount him, he said in a soft voice . Once a beast ' s been joined to a man, any skinchanger can slip inside and ride him . Orell was withering inside his feathers, so I took the eagle for my own . But the joining works both ways, warg . Orell lives inside me now, whispering how much he hates you . And I can soar above the Wall, and see with eagle eyes.So we know, said Mance . We know how few you were, when you stopped the turtle . We know how many came from Eastwatch . We know how your supplies have dwindled . Pitch, oil, arrows, spears . Even your stair is gone, and that cage can only lift so many . We know . And now you know we know . He opened the flap of the tent . Come inside . The rest of you, wait here.What, even me? said Tormund.Particularly you . Always.It was warm within . A small fire burned beneath the smoke holes, and a brazier smouldered near the pile of furs where Dalla lay, pale and sweating . Her sister was holding her hand . Val, Jon remembered . I was sorry when Jarl fell, he told her.Val looked at him with pale grey eyes . He always climbed too fast . She was as fair as he ' d remembered, slender, full-breasted, graceful even at rest, with high sharp cheekbones and a thick braid of honey-colored hair that fell to her waist.Dalla ' s time is near, Mance explained . She and Val will stay . They know what I mean to say.Jon kept his face as still as ice . Foul enough to slay a man in his own tent under truce . Must I murder him in front of his wife as their child is being born? He closed the fingers of his sword hand . Mance was not wearing armor, but his own sword was sheathed on his left hip . And there were other weapons in the tent, daggers and dirks, a bow and a quiver of arrows, a bronze-headed spear lying beside that big black . . .. . . horn.Jon sucked in his breath.A warhorn, a bloody great warhorn.Yes, Mance said . The Horn of Winter, that Joramun once blew to wake giants from the earth.The horn was huge, eight feet along the curve and so wide at the mouth that he could have put his arm inside up to the elbow . If this came from an aurochs, it was the biggest that ever lived . At first he thought the bands around it were bronze, but when he moved closer he realized they were gold . Old gold, more brown than yellow, and graven with runes.Ygritte said you never found the horn.Did you think only crows could lie? I liked you well enough, for a bastard . . . but I never trusted you . A man needs to earn my trust.Jon faced him . <|endoftext|> If you ' ve had the Horn of Joramun all along, why haven ' t you used it? Why bother building turtles and sending Thenns to kill us in our beds? If this horn is all the songs say, why not just sound it and be done? <|endoftext|>It was Dalla who answered him, Dalla great with child, lying on her pile of furs beside the brazier . We free folk know things you kneelers have forgotten . Sometimes the short road is not the safest, Jon Snow . The Horned Lord once said that sorcery is a sword without a hilt . There is no safe way to grasp it.Mance ran a hand along the curve of the great horn . No man goes hunting with only one arrow in his quiver, he said . I had hoped that Styr and Jarl would take your brothers unawares, and open the gate for us . I drew your garrison away with feints and raids and secondary attacks . Bowen Marsh swallowed that lure as I knew he would, but your band of cripples and orphans proved to be more stubborn than anticipated . Don ' t think you ' ve stopped us, though . The truth is, you are too few and we are too many . I could continue the attack here and still send ten thousand men to cross the Bay of Seals on rafts and take Eastwatch from the rear . I could storm the Shadow Tower too, I know the approaches as well as any man alive . I could send men and mammoths to dig out the gates at the castles you ' ve abandoned, all of them at once.Why don ' t you, then? Jon could have drawn Longclaw then, but he wanted to hear what the wildling had to say.Blood, said Mance Rayder . I ' d win in the end, yes, but you ' d bleed me, and my people have bled enough.Your losses haven ' t been that heavy.Not at your hands . Mance studied Jon ' s face . You saw the Fist of the First Men . You know what happened there . You know what we are facing.The Others . . .They grow stronger as the days grow shorter and the nights colder . First they kill you, then they send your dead against you . The giants have not been able to stand against them, nor the Thenns, the ice river clans, the Hornfoots.Nor you?Nor me . There was anger in that admission, and bitterness too deep for words . Raymun Redbeard, Bael the Bard, Gendel and Gorne, the Horned Lord, they all came south to conquer, but I ' ve come with my tail between my legs to hide behind your Wall . He touched the horn again . If I sound the Horn of Winter, the Wall will fall . Or so the songs would have me believe . There are those among my people who want nothing more . . .But once the Wall is fallen, Dalla said, what will stop the Others?Mance gave her a fond smile . It ' s a wise woman I ' ve found . A true queen . He turned back to Jon . Go back and tell them to open their gate and let us pass . If they do, I will give them the horn, and the Wall will stand until the end of days.Open the gate and let them pass . Easy to say, but what must follow? Giants camping in the ruins of Winterfell? Cannibals in the wolfswood, chariots sweeping across the barrowlands, free folk stealing the daughters of shipwrights and silversmiths from White Harbor and fishwives off the Stony Shore? Jon asked suddenly . <|endoftext|> Are you a true king? <|endoftext|>I ' ve never had a crown on my head or sat my arse on a bloody throne, if that ' s what you ' re asking, Mance replied . My birth is as low as a man ' s can get, no septon ' s ever smeared my head with oils, I don ' t own any castles, and my queen wears furs and amber, not silk and sapphires . I am my own champion, my own fool, and my own harpist . You don ' t become King-beyond-the-Wall because your father was . The free folk won ' t follow a name, and they don ' t care which brother was born first . They follow fighters . When I left the Shadow Tower there were five men making noises about how they might be the stuff of kings . Tormund was one, the Magnar another . The other three I slew, when they made it plain they ' d sooner fight than follow.Jon said bluntly, <|endoftext|> You can kill your enemies, but can you rule your friends? If we let your people pass, are you strong enough to make them keep the king ' s peace and obey the laws? <|endoftext|>Whose laws? The laws of Winterfell and King ' s Landing? Mance laughed . When we want laws we ' ll make our own . You can keep your king ' s justice too, and your king ' s taxes . I ' m offering you the horn, not our freedom . We will not kneel to you.What if we refuse the offer? Jon had no doubt that they would . The Old Bear might at least have listened, though he would have balked at the notion of letting thirty or forty thousand wildlings loose on the Seven Kingdoms . But Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt would dismiss the notion out of hand.If you refuse, Mance Rayder said, Tormund Giantsbane will sound the Horn of Winter three days hence, at dawn.He could carry the message back to Castle Black and tell them of the horn, but if he left Mance still alive Lord Janos and Ser Alliser would seize on that as proof that he was a turncloak . A thousand thoughts flickered through Jon ' s head . If I can destroy the horn, smash it here and now . . . but before he could begin to think that through, he heard the low moan of some other horn, made faint by the tent ' s hide walls . Mance heard it too . Frowning, he went to the door . Jon followed.The warhorn was louder outside . Its call had stirred the wildling camp . Three Hornfoot men jogged past, carrying long spears . Horses were whinnying and snorting, giants roaring in the Old Tongue, and even the mammoths were restless.Outrider ' s horn, Tormund told Mance.Something ' s coming . Varamyr sat crosslegged on the half-frozen ground, his wolves circled restlessly around him . A shadow swept over him, and Jon looked up to see the eagle ' s blue-grey wings . Coming, from the east.When the dead walk, walls and stakes and swords mean nothing, he remembered . You cannot fight the dead, Jon Snow . No man knows that half so well as me.Harma scowled . East? The wights should be behind us.East, the skinchanger repeated . Something ' s coming.Jon asked . <|endoftext|> The Others? <|endoftext|>Mance shook his head . The Others never come when the sun is up . Chariots were rattling across the killing ground, jammed with riders waving spears of sharpened bone . The king groaned . Where the bloody hell do they think they ' re going? Quenn, get those fools back where they belong . Someone bring my horse . The mare, not the stallion . I ' ll want my armor too . Mance glanced suspiciously at the Wall . Atop the icy parapets, the straw soldiers stood collecting arrows, but there was no sign of any other activity . Harma, mount up your raiders . Tormund, find your sons and give me a triple line of spears.Aye, said Tormund, striding off.The mousy little skinchanger closed his eyes and said, I see them . They ' re coming along the streams and game trails . . .Men . Men on horses . Men in steel and men in black.Crows . Mance made the word a curse . He turned on Jon . Did my old brothers think they ' d catch me with my breeches down if they attacked while we were talking?If they planned an attack they never told me about it . Jon did not believe it . Lord Janos lacked the men to attack the wildling camp . Besides, he was on the wrong side of the Wall, and the gate was sealed with rubble . He had a different sort of treachery in mind, this can ' t be his work.If you ' re lying to me again, you won ' t be leaving here alive, Mance warned . His guards brought him his horse and armor . Elsewhere around the camp, Jon saw people running at cross purposes, some men forming up as if to storm the Wall while others slipped into the woods, women driving dog carts east, mammoths wandering west . He reached back over his shoulder and drew Longclaw just as a thin line of rangers emerged from the fringes of the wood three hundred yards away . They wore black mail, black halfhelms, and black cloaks . Half-armored, Mance drew his sword . You knew nothing of this, did you? he said to Jon, coldly.Slow as honey on a cold morning, the rangers swept down on the wildling camp, picking their way through clumps of gorse and stands of trees, over roots and rocks . Wildlings flew to meet them, shouting war cries and waving clubs and bronze swords and axes made of flint, galloping headlong at their ancient enemies . A shout, a slash, and a fine brave death, Jon had heard brothers say of the free folk ' s way of fighting.Jon told the King-beyond-the-Wall, <|endoftext|> Believe what you will, but I knew nothing of any attack . <|endoftext|>Harma thundered past before Mance could reply, riding at the head of thirty raiders . Her standard went before her; a dead dog impaled on a spear, raining blood at every stride . Mance watched as she smashed into the rangers . Might be you ' re telling it true, he said . Those look like Eastwatch men . Sailors on horses . Cotter Pyke always had more guts than sense . He took the Lord of Bones at Long Barrow, he might have thought to do the same with me . If so, he ' s a fool . He doesn ' t have the men, he—Mance! the shout came . It was a scout, bursting from the trees on a lathered horse . Mance, there ' s more, they ' re all around us, iron men, iron, a host of iron men.Cursing, Mance swung up into the saddle . Varamyr, stay and see that no harm comes to Dalla . The King-beyond-the-Wall pointed his sword at Jon . And keep a few extra eyes on this crow . If he runs, rip out his throat.Aye, I ' ll do that . The skinchanger was a head shorter than Jon, slumped and soft, but that shadowcat could disembowel him with one paw . They ' re coming from the north too, Varamyr told Mance . You best go.Mance donned his helm with its raven wings . His men were mounted up as well . Arrowhead, Mance snapped, to me, form wedge . Yet when he slammed his heels into the mare and flew across the field at the rangers, the men who raced to catch him lost all semblance of formation.Jon took a step toward the tent, thinking of the Horn of Winter, but the shadowcat blocked him, tail lashing . The beast ' s nostrils flared, and slaver ran from his curved front teeth . He smells my fear . He missed Ghost more than ever then . The two wolves were behind him, growling.Banners, he heard Varamyr murmur, I see golden banners, oh . . . A mammoth lumbered by, trumpeting, a half-dozen bowmen in the wooden tower on its back . The king . . . no . . .Then the skinchanger threw back his head and screamed.The sound was shocking, ear-piercing, thick with agony . Varamyr fell, writhing, and the ' cat was screaming too . . . and high, high in the eastern sky, against the wall of cloud, Jon saw the eagle burning . For a heartbeat it flamed brighter than a star, wreathed in red and gold and orange, its wings beating wildly at the air as if it could fly from the pain . Higher it flew, and higher, and higher still.The scream brought Val out of the tent, white-faced . What is it, what ' s happened? Varamyr ' s wolves were fighting each other, and the shadowcat had raced off into the trees, but the man was still twisting on the ground . What ' s wrong with him? Val demanded, horrified . Where ' s Mance?Jon pointed . <|endoftext|> There . Gone to fight . <|endoftext|> The king led his ragged wedge into a knot of rangers, his sword flashing.Gone? He can ' t be gone, not now . It ' s started.The battle? He watched the rangers scatter before Harma ' s bloody dog ' s head . The raiders screamed and hacked and chased the men in black back into the trees . But there were more men coming from the wood, a column of horse . Knights on heavy horse, Jon saw . Harma had to regroup and wheel to meet them, but half of her men had raced too far ahead.The birth! Val was shouting at him.Trumpets were blowing all around, loud and brazen . The wildlings have no trumpets, only warhorns . They knew that as well as he did; the sound sent free folk running in confusion, some toward the fighting, others away . A mammoth was stomping through a flock of sheep that three men were trying to herd off west . The drums were beating as the wildlings ran to form squares and lines, but they were too late, too disorganized, too slow . The enemy was emerging from the forest, from the east, the northeast, the north; three great columns of heavy horse, all dark glinting steel and bright wool surcoats . Not the men of Eastwatch, those had been no more than a line of scouts . An army . The king? Jon was as confused as the wildlings . Could Robb have returned? Had the boy on the Iron Throne finally bestirred himself? You best get back inside the tent, he told Val.Across the field one column had washed over Harma Dogshead . Another smashed into the flank of Tormund ' s spearmen as he and his sons desperately tried to turn them . The giants were climbing onto their mammoths, though, and the knights on their barded horses did not like that at all; he could see how the coursers and destriers screamed and scattered at the sight of those lumbering mountains . But there was fear on the wildling side as well, hundreds of women and children rushing away from the battle, some of them blundering right under the hooves of garrons . He saw an old woman ' s dog cart veer into the path of three chariots, to send them crashing into each other.Gods, Val whispered, gods, why are they doing this?Go inside the tent and stay with Dalla . It ' s not safe out here . It wouldn ' t be a great deal safer inside, but she didn ' t need to hear that.I need to find the midwife, Val said.You ' re the midwife . I ' ll stay here until Mance comes back . He had lost sight of Mance but now he found him again, cutting his way through a knot of mounted men . The mammoths had shattered the center column, but the other two were closing like pincers . On the eastern edge of the camps, some archers were loosing fire arrows at the tents . He saw a mammoth pluck a knight from his saddle and fling him forty feet with a flick of its trunk . Wildlings streamed past, women and children running from the battle, some with men hurrying them along . A few of them gave Jon dark looks but Longclaw was in his hand, and no one troubled him . Even Varamyr fled, crawling off on his hands and knees.More and more men were pouring from the trees, not only knights now but freeriders and mounted bowmen and men-at-arms in jacks and kettle helms, dozens of men, hundreds of men . A blaze of banners flew above them . The wind was whipping them too wildly for Jon to see the sigils, but he glimpsed a seahorse, a field of birds, a ring of flowers . And yellow, so much yellow, yellow banners with a red device, whose arms were those?East and north and northeast, he saw bands of wildlings trying to stand and fight, but the attackers rode right over them . The free folk still had the numbers, but the attackers had steel armor and heavy horses . In the thickest part of the fray, Jon saw Mance standing tall in his stirrups . His red-and-black cloak and raven-winged helm made him easy to pick out . He had his sword raised and men were rallying to him when a wedge of knights smashed into them with lance and sword and longaxe . Mance ' s mare went up on her hind legs, kicking, and a spear took her through the breast . Then the steel tide washed over him.It ' s done, Jon thought, they ' re breaking . The wildlings were running, throwing down their weapons, Hornfoot men and cave dwellers and Thenns in bronze scales, they were running . Mance was gone, someone was waving Harma ' s head on a pole, Tormund ' s lines had broken . Only the giants on their mammoths were holding, hairy islands in a red steel sea . The fires were leaping from tent to tent and some of the tall pines were going up as well . And through the smoke another wedge of armored riders came, on barded horses . Floating above them were the largest banners yet, royal standards as big as sheets; a yellow one with long pointed tongues that showed a flaming heart, and another like a sheet of beaten gold, with a black stag prancing and rippling in the wind.Robert, Jon thought for one mad moment, remembering poor Owen, but when the trumpets blew again and the knights charged, the name they cried was Stannis! Stannis! STANNIS!Jon turned away, and went inside the tent.Jon prowled around Satin in a slow circle, sword in hand, forcing him to turn . <|endoftext|> Get your shield up, <|endoftext|> he said.It ' s too heavy, the Oldtown boy complained.It ' s as heavy as it needs to be to stop a sword, Jon said . Now get it up . He stepped forward, slashing . Satin jerked the shield up in time to catch the sword on its rim, and swung his own blade at Jon ' s ribs . Good, Jon said, when he felt the impact on his own shield . That was good . But you need to put your body into it . Get your weight behind the steel and you ' ll do more damage than with arm strength alone . Come, try it again, drive at me, but keep the shield up or I ' ll ring your head like a bell . . .Instead Satin took a step backward and raised his visor . Jon, he said, in an anxious voice.When he turned, she was standing behind him, with half a dozen queen ' s men around her . Small wonder the yard grew so quiet . He had glimpsed Melisandre at her nightfires, and coming and going about the castle, but never so close . She ' s beautiful, he thought . . . but there was something more than a little unsettling about red eyes . My lady.The king would speak with you, Jon Snow.Jon thrust the practice sword into the earth . <|endoftext|> Might I be allowed to change? I am in no fit state to stand before a king . <|endoftext|>We shall await you atop the Wall, said Melisandre . We, Jon heard, not he . It ' s as they say . This is his true queen, not the one he left at Eastwatch.He hung his mail and plate inside the armory, returned to his own cell, discarded his sweat-stained clothes, and donned a fresh set of blacks . It would be cold and windy in the cage, he knew, and colder and windier still on top of the ice, so he chose a heavy hooded cloak . Last of all he collected Longclaw, and slung the bastard sword across his back.Melisandre was waiting for him at the base of the Wall . She had sent her queen ' s men away . Jon asked her as they entered the cage . <|endoftext|> What does His Grace want of me? <|endoftext|>All you have to give, Jon Snow . He is a king.He shut the door and pulled the bell cord . The winch began to turn . They rose . The day was bright and the Wall was weeping, long fingers of water trickling down its face and glinting in the sun . In the close confines of the iron cage, he was acutely aware of the red woman ' s presence . She even smells red . The scent reminded him of Mikken ' s forge, of the way iron smelled when red-hot; the scent was smoke and blood . Kissed by fire, he thought, remembering Ygritte . The wind got in amongst Melisandre ' s long red robes and sent them flapping against Jon ' s legs as he stood beside her . You are not cold, my lady? he asked her.She laughed . Never . The ruby at her throat seemed to pulse, in time with the beating of her heart . The Lord ' s fire lives within me, Jon Snow . Feel . She put her hand on his cheek, and held it there while he felt how warm she was . That is how life should feel, she told him . Only death is cold.They found Stannis Baratheon standing alone at the edge of the Wall, brooding over the field where he had won his battle, and the great green forest beyond . He was dressed in the same black breeches, tunic, and boots that a brother of the Night ' s Watch might wear . Only his cloak set him apart; a heavy golden cloak trimmed in black fur, and pinned with a brooch in the shape of a flaming heart . I have brought you the Bastard of Winterfell, Your Grace, said Melisandre.Stannis turned to study him . Beneath his heavy brow were eyes like bottomless blue pools . His hollow cheeks and strong jaw were covered with a short-cropped blue-black beard that did little to conceal the gauntness of his face, and his teeth were clenched . His neck and shoulders were clenched as well, and his right hand . Jon found himself remembering something Donal Noye once said about the Baratheon brothers . Robert was the true steel . Stannis is pure iron, black and hard and strong, but brittle, the way iron gets . He ' ll break before he bends . Uneasily, he knelt, wondering why this brittle king had need of him.Rise . I have heard much and more of you, Lord Snow.I am no lord, sire . Jon rose . I know what you have heard . That I am a turncloak, and craven . That I slew my brother Qhorin Halfhand so the wildlings would spare my life . That I rode with Mance Rayder, and took a wildling wife.Aye . All that, and more . You are a warg too, they say, a skinchanger who walks at night as a wolf . King Stannis had a hard smile . How much of it is true?I had a direwolf, Ghost . I left him when I climbed the Wall near Greyguard, and have not seen him since . Qhorin Halfhand commanded me to join the wildlings . He knew they would make me kill him to prove myself, and told me to do whatever they asked of me . The woman was named Ygritte . I broke my vows with her, but I swear to you on my father ' s name that I never turned my cloak.I believe you, the king said.That startled him . Why?Stannis snorted . I know Janos Slynt . And I knew Ned Stark as well . Your father was no friend of mine, but only a fool would doubt his honor or his honesty . You have his look . A big man, Stannis Baratheon towered over Jon, but he was so gaunt that he looked ten years older than he was . I know more than you might think, Jon Snow . I know it was you who found the dragonglass dagger that Randyll Tarly ' s son used to slay the Other.Ghost found it . The blade was wrapped in a ranger ' s cloak and buried beneath the Fist of the First Men . There were other blades as well . . . spearheads, arrowheads, all dragonglass.I know you held the gate here, King Stannis said . If not, I would have come too late.Donal Noye held the gate . He died below in the tunnel, fighting the king of the giants.Stannis grimaced . Noye made my first sword for me, and Robert ' s warhammer as well . Had the god seen fit to spare him, he would have made a better Lord Commander for your order than any of these fools who are squabbling over it now.Jon said . <|endoftext|> Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys Mallister are no fools, sire, They ' re good men, and capable . Othell Yarwyck as well, in his own way . Lord Mormont trusted each of them . <|endoftext|>Your Lord Mormont trusted too easily . Else he would not have died as he did . But we were speaking of you . I have not forgotten that it was you who brought us this magic horn, and captured Mance Rayder ' s wife and son.Dalla died . Jon was saddened by that still . Val is her sister . She and the babe did not require much capturing, Your Grace . You had put the wildlings to flight, and the skinchanger Mance had left to guard his queen went mad when the eagle burned . Jon looked at Melisandre . Some say that was your doing.She smiled, her long copper hair tumbling across her face . The Lord of Light has fiery talons, Jon Snow.Jon nodded, and turned back to the king . <|endoftext|> Your Grace, you spoke of Val . She has asked to see Mance Rayder, to bring his son to him . It would be a . . . a kindness . <|endoftext|>The man is a deserter from your order . Your brothers are all insisting on his death . Why should I do him a kindness?Jon had no answer for that . <|endoftext|> If not for him, for Val . For her sister ' s sake, the child ' s mother . <|endoftext|>You are fond of this Val?I scarcely know her.They tell me she is comely.Jon admitted . <|endoftext|> Very, <|endoftext|>Beauty can be treacherous . My brother learned that lesson from Cersei Lannister . She murdered him, do not doubt it . Your father and Jon Arryn as well . He scowled . You rode with these wildlings . Is there any honor in them, do you think?Jon said, <|endoftext|> Yes, but their own sort of honor, sire . <|endoftext|>In Mance Rayder?Yes . I think so.In the Lord of Bones?Jon hesitated . <|endoftext|> Rattleshirt, we called him . Treacherous and blood-thirsty . If there ' s honor in him, he hides it down beneath his suit of bones . <|endoftext|>And this other man, this Tormund of the many names who eluded us after the battle? Answer me truly.Tormund Giantsbane seemed to me the sort of man who would make a good friend and a bad enemy, Your Grace.Stannis gave a curt nod . Your father was a man of honor . He was no friend to me, but I saw his worth . Your brother was a rebel and a traitor who meant to steal half my kingdom, but no man can question his courage . What of you?Does he want me to say I love him? Jon ' s voice was stiff and formal as he said, I am a man of the Night ' s Watch.Words . Words are wind . Why do you think I abandoned Dragonstone and sailed to the Wall, Lord Snow?I am no lord, sire . You came because we sent for you, I hope . Though I could not say why you took so long about it.Surprisingly, Stannis smiled at that . You ' re bold enough to be a Stark . Yes, I should have come sooner . If not for my Hand, I might not have come at all . Lord Seaworth is a man of humble birth, but he reminded me of my duty, when all I could think of was my rights . I had the cart before the horse, Davos said . I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne . Stannis pointed north . There is where I ' ll find the foe that I was born to fight.His name may not be spoken, Melisandre added softly . He is the God of Night and Terror, Jon Snow, and these shapes in the snow are his creatures.They tell me that you slew one of these walking corpses to save Lord Mormont ' s life, Stannis said . It may be that this is your war as well, Lord Snow . If you will give me your help.My sword is pledged to the Night ' s Watch, Your Grace, Jon Snow answered carefully.That did not please the king . Stannis ground his teeth and said, I need more than a sword from you.Jon was lost . <|endoftext|> My lord? <|endoftext|>I need the north.The north . I . . . my brother Robb was King in the North . . .Your brother was the rightful Lord of Winterfell . If he had stayed home and done his duty, instead of crowning himself and riding off to conquer the riverlands, he might be alive today . Be that as it may . You are not Robb, no more than I am Robert.The harsh words had blown away whatever sympathy Jon might have had for Stannis . I loved my brother, he said.And I mine . Yet they were what they were, and so are we . I am the only true king in Westeros, north or south . And you are Ned Stark ' s bastard . Stannis studied him with those dark blue eyes . Tywin Lannister has named Roose Bolton his Warden of the North, to reward him for betraying your brother . The ironmen are fighting amongst themselves since Balon Greyjoy ' s death, yet they still hold Moat Cailin, Deepwood Motte, Torrhen ' s Square, and most of the Stony Shore . Your father ' s lands are bleeding, and I have neither the strength nor the time to stanch the wounds . What is needed is a Lord of Winterfell . A loyal Lord of Winterfell.He is looking at me, Jon thought, stunned . Winterfell is no more . Theon Greyjoy put it to the torch.Granite does not burn easily, Stannis said . The castle can be rebuilt, in time . It ' s not the walls that make a lord, it ' s the man . Your northmen do not know me, have no reason to love me, yet I will need their strength in the battles yet to come . I need a son of Eddard Stark to win them to my banner.He would make me Lord of Winterfell . The wind was gusting, and Jon felt so light-headed he was half afraid it would blow him off the Wall . Your Grace, he said, you forget . I am a Snow, not a Stark.It ' s you who are forgetting, King Stannis replied.Melisandre put a warm hand on Jon ' s arm . A king can remove the taint of bastardy with a stroke, Lord Snow.Lord Snow . Ser Alliser Thorne had named him that, to mock his bastard birth . Many of his brothers had taken to using it as well, some with affection, others to wound . But suddenly it had a different sound to it in Jon ' s ears . It sounded . . . real . Yes, he said, hesitantly, kings have legitimized bastards before, but . . . I am still a brother of the Night ' s Watch . I knelt before a heart tree and swore to hold no lands and father no children.Jon . Melisandre was so close he could feel the warmth of her breath . R ' hllor is the only true god . A vow sworn to a tree has no more power than one sworn to your shoes . Open your heart and let the light of the Lord come in . Burn these weirwoods, and accept Winterfell as a gift of the Lord of Light.When Jon had been very young, too young to understand what it meant to be a bastard, he used to dream that one day Winterfell might be his . Later, when he was older, he had been ashamed of those dreams . Winterfell would go to Robb and then his sons, or to Bran or Rickon should Robb die childless . And after them came Sansa and Arya . Even to dream otherwise seemed disloyal, as if he were betraying them in his heart, wishing for their deaths . I never wanted this, he thought as he stood before the blue-eyed king and the red woman . I loved Robb, loved all of them . . . I never wanted any harm to come to any of them, but it did . And now there ' s only me . All he had to do was say the word, and he would be Jon Stark, and nevermore a Snow . All he had to do was pledge this king his fealty, and Winterfell was his . All he had to do . . .. . . was forswear his vows again.And this time it would not be a ruse . To claim his father ' s castle, he must turn against his father ' s gods.King Stannis gazed off north again, his gold cloak streaming from his shoulders . It may be that I am mistaken in you, Jon Snow . We both know the things that are said of bastards . You may lack your father ' s honor, or your brother ' s skill in arms . But you are the weapon the Lord has given me . I have found you here, as you found the cache of dragonglass beneath the Fist, and I mean to make use of you . Even Azor Ahai did not win his war alone . I killed a thousand wildlings, took another thousand captive, and scattered the rest, but we both know they will return . Melisandre has seen that in her fires . This Tormund Thunderfist is likely re-forming them even now, and planning some new assault . And the more we bleed each other, the weaker we shall all be when the real enemy falls upon us.Jon had come to that same realization . <|endoftext|> As you say, Your Grace . <|endoftext|> He wondered where this king, was going.Whilst your brothers have been struggling to decide who shall lead them, I have been speaking with this Mance Rayder . He ground his teeth . A stubborn man, that one, and prideful . He will leave me no choice but to give him to the flames . But we took other captives as well, other leaders . The one who calls himself the Lord of Bones, some of their clan chiefs, the new Magnar of Thenn . Your brothers will not like it, no more than your father ' s lords, but I mean to allow the wildlings through the Wall . . . those who will swear me their fealty, pledge to keep the king ' s peace and the king ' s laws, and take the Lord of Light as their god . Even the giants, if those great knees of theirs can bend . I will settle them on the Gift, once I have wrested it away from your new Lord Commander . When the cold winds rise, we shall live or die together . It is time we made alliance against our common foe . He looked at Jon . Would you agree?My father dreamed of resettling the Gift, Jon admitted . He and my uncle Benjen used to talk of it . He never thought of settling it with wildlings, though . . . but he never rode with wildlings, either . He did not fool himself; the free folk would make for unruly subjects and dangerous neighbors . Yet when he weighed Ygritte ' s red hair against the cold blue eyes of the wights, the choice was easy . I agree.Good, King Stannis said, for the surest way to seal a new alliance is with a marriage . I mean to wed my Lord of Winterfell to this wildling princess.Perhaps Jon had ridden with the free folk too long; he could not help but laugh . Your Grace, he said, captive or no, if you think you can just give Val to me, I fear you have a deal to learn about wildling women . Whoever weds her had best be prepared to climb in her tower window and carry her off at swordpoint . . .Whoever? Stannis gave him a measuring look . Does this mean you will not wed the girl? I warn you, she is part of the price you must pay, if you want your father ' s name and your father ' s castle . This match is necessary, to help assure the loyalty of our new subjects . Are you refusing me, Jon Snow?Jon said, too quickly . It was Winterfell the king was speaking of, and Winterfell was not to be lightly refused . <|endoftext|> No, I mean . . . this has all come very suddenly, Your Grace . Might I beg you for some time to consider? <|endoftext|>As you wish . But consider quickly . I am not a patient man, as your black brothers are about to discover . Stannis put a thin, fleshless hand on Jon ' s shoulder . Say nothing of what we ' ve discussed here today . To anyone . But when you return, you need only bend your knee, lay your sword at my feet, and pledge yourself to my service, and you shall rise again as Jon Stark, the Lord of Winterfell.Iron Emmett was a long, lanky young ranger whose endurance, strength, and swordsmanship were the pride of Eastwatch . Jon always came away from their sessions stiff and sore, and woke the next day covered with bruises, which was just the way he wanted it . He would never get any better going up against the likes of Satin and Horse, or even Grenn.Most days he gave as good as he got, Jon liked to think, but not today . He had hardly slept last night, and after an hour of restless tossing he had given up even the attempt, dressed, and walked the top of the Wall till the sun came up, wrestling with Stannis Baratheon ' s offer . The lack of sleep was catching up with him now, and Emmett was hammering him mercilessly across the yard, driving him back on his heels with one long looping cut after another, and slamming him with his shield from time to time for good measure . Jon ' s arm had gone numb from the shock of impact, and the edgeless practice sword seemed to be growing heavier with every passing moment.He was almost ready to lower his blade and call a halt when Emmett feinted low and came in over his shield with a savage forehand slash that caught Jon on the temple . He staggered, his helm and head both ringing from the force of the blow . For half a heartbeat the world beyond his eyeslit was a blur.And then the years were gone, and he was back at Winterfell once more, wearing a quilted leather coat in place of mail and plate . His sword was made of wood, and it was Robb who stood facing him, not Iron Emmett.Every morning they had trained together, since they were big enough to walk; Snow and Stark, spinning and slashing about the wards of Winterfell, shouting and laughing, sometimes crying when there was no one else to see . They were not little boys when they fought, but knights and mighty heroes . I ' m Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, Jon would call out, and Robb would shout back, Well, I ' m Florian the Fool . Or Robb would say, I ' m the Young Dragon, and Jon would reply, I ' m Ser Ryam Redwyne.That morning he called it first . I ' m Lord of Winterfell! he cried, as he had a hundred times before . Only this time, this time, Robb had answered, You can ' t be Lord of Winterfell, you ' re bastard-born . My lady mother says you can ' t ever be the Lord of Winterfell.I thought I had forgotten that . Jon could taste blood in his mouth, from the blow he ' d taken.In the end Halder and Horse had to pull him away from Iron Emmett, one man on either arm . The ranger sat on the ground dazed, his shield half in splinters, the visor of his helm knocked askew, and his sword six yards away . Jon, enough, Halder was shouting, he ' s down, you disarmed him . Enough!No . Not enough . Never enough . Jon let his sword drop . I ' m sorry, he muttered . Emmett, are you hurt?Iron Emmett pulled his battered helm off . Was there some part of yield you could not comprehend, Lord Snow? It was said amiably, though . Emmett was an amiable man, and he loved the song of swords . Warrior defend me, he groaned, now I know how Qhorin Halfhand must have felt.That was too much . Jon wrenched free of his friends and retreated to the armory, alone . His ears were still ringing from the blow Emmett had dealt him . He sat on the bench and buried his head in his hands . Why am I so angry? he asked himself, but it was a stupid question . Lord of Winterfell . I could be the Lord of Winterfell . My father ' s heir.It was not Lord Eddard ' s face he saw floating before him, though; it was Lady Catelyn ' s . With her deep blue eyes and hard cold mouth, she looked a bit like Stannis . Iron, he thought, but brittle . She was looking at him the way she used to look at him at Winterfell, whenever he had bested Robb at swords or sums or most anything . Who are you? that look had always seemed to say . This is not your place . Why are you here?His friends were still out in the practice yard, but Jon was in no fit state to face them . He left the armory by the back, descending a steep flight of stone steps to the wormways, the tunnels that linked the castle ' s keeps and towers below the earth . It was short walk to the bathhouse, where he took a cold plunge to wash the sweat off and soaked in a hot stone tub . The warmth took some of the ache from his muscles and made him think of Winterfell ' s muddy pools, steaming and bubbling in the godswood . Winterfell, he thought . Theon left it burned and broken, but I could restore it . Surely his father would have wanted that, and Robb as well . They would never have wanted the castle left in ruins.You can ' t be the Lord of Winterfell, you ' re bastard-born, he heard Robb say again . And the stone kings were growling at him with granite tongues . You do not belong here . This is not your place . When Jon closed his eyes he saw the heart tree, with its pale limbs, red leaves, and solemn face . The weirwood was the heart of Winterfell, Lord Eddard always said . . . but to save the castle Jon would have to tear that heart up by its ancient roots, and feed it to the red woman ' s hungry fire god . I have no right, he thought . Winterfell belongs to the old gods.The sound of voices echoing off the vaulted ceiling brought him back to Castle Black . I don ' t know, a man was saying, in a voice thick with doubts . Maybe if I knew the man better . . . Lord Stannis didn ' t have much good to say of him, I ' ll tell you that.When has Stannis Baratheon ever had much good to say of anyone? Ser Alliser ' s flinty voice was unmistakable . If we let Stannis choose our Lord Commander, we become his bannermen in all but name . Tywin Lannister is not like to forget that, and you know it will be Lord Tywin who wins in the end . He ' s already beaten Stannis once, on the Blackwater.Lord Tywin favors Slynt, said Bowen Marsh, in a fretful, anxious voice . I can show you his letter, Othell . ‘ Our faithful friend and servant, ' he called him.Jon Snow sat up suddenly, and the three men froze at the sound of the slosh . <|endoftext|> My lords, <|endoftext|> he said with cold courtesy.What are you doing here, bastard? Thorne asked.Jon climbed from the water, dried, dressed, and left them to conspire . <|endoftext|> Bathing . But don ' t let me spoil your plotting . <|endoftext|>Outside, he found he had no idea where he was going . He walked past the shell of the Lord Commander ' s Tower, where once he ' d saved the Old Bear from a dead man; past the spot where Ygritte had died with that sad smile on her face; past the King ' s Tower where he and Satin and Deaf Dick Follard had waited for the Magnar and his Thenns; past the heaped and charred remains of the great wooden stair . The inner gate was open, so Jon went down the tunnel, through the Wall . He could feel the cold around him, the weight of all the ice above his head . He walked past the place where Donal Noye and Mag the Mighty had fought and died together, through the new outer gate, and back into the pale cold sunlight.Only then did he permit himself to stop, to take a breath, to think . Othell Yarwyck was not a man of strong convictions, except when it came to wood and stone and mortar . The Old Bear had known that . Thorne and Marsh will sway him, Yarwyck will support Lord Janos, and Lord Janos will be chosen Lord Commander . And what does that leave me, if not Winterfell?A wind swirled against the Wall, tugging at his cloak . He could feel the cold coming off the ice the way heat comes off a fire . Jon pulled up his hood and began to walk again . The afternoon was growing old, and the sun was low in the west . A hundred yards away was the camp where King Stannis had confined his wildling captives within a ring of ditches, sharpened stakes, and high wooden fences . To his left were three great firepits, where the victors had burned the bodies of all the free folk to die beneath the Wall, huge pelted giants and little Hornfoot men alike . The killing ground was still a desolation of scorched weeds and hardened pitch, but Mance ' s people had left traces of themselves everywhere; a torn hide that might have been part of a tent, a giant ' s maul, the wheel of a chariot, a broken spear, a pile of mammoth dung . On the edge of the haunted forest, where the tents had been, Jon found an oakwood stump and sat.Ygritte wanted me to be a wildling . Stannis wants me to be the Lord of Winterfell . But what do I want? The sun crept down the sky to dip behind the Wall where it curved through the western hills . Jon watched as that towering expanse of ice took on the reds and pinks of sunset . Would I sooner be hanged for a turncloak by Lord Janos, or forswear my vows, marry Val, and become the Lord of Winterfell? It seemed an easy choice when he thought of it in those terms . . . though if Ygritte had still been alive, it might have been even easier . Val was a stranger to him . She was not hard on the eyes, certainly, and she had been sister to Mance Rayder ' s queen, but still . . .I would need to steal her if I wanted her love, but she might give me children . I might someday hold a son of my own blood in my arms . A son was something Jon Snow had never dared dream of, since he decided to live his life on the Wall . I could name him Robb . Val would want to keep her sister ' s son, but we could foster him at Winterfell, and Gilly ' s boy as well . Sam would never need to tell his lie . We ' d find a place for Gilly too, and Sam could come visit her once a year or so . Mance ' s son and Craster ' s would grow up brothers, as I once did with Robb.He wanted it, Jon knew then . He wanted it as much as he had ever wanted anything . I have always wanted it, he thought, guiltily . May the gods forgive me . It was a hunger inside him, sharp as a dragonglass blade . A hunger . . . he could feel it . It was food he needed, prey, a red deer that stank of fear or a great elk proud and defiant . He needed to kill and fill his belly with fresh meat and hot dark blood . His mouth began to water with the thought.It was a long moment before he understood what was happening . When he did, he bolted to his feet . Ghost? He turned toward the wood, and there he came, padding silently out of the green dusk, the breath coming warm and white from his open jaws . Ghost! he shouted, and the direwolf broke into a run . He was leaner than he had been, but bigger as well, and the only sound he made was the soft crunch of dead leaves beneath his paws . When he reached Jon he leapt, and they wrestled amidst brown grass and long shadows as the stars came out above them . Gods, wolf, where have you been? Jon said when Ghost stopped worrying at his forearm . I thought you ' d died on me, like Robb and Ygritte and all the rest . I ' ve had no sense of you, not since I climbed the Wall, not even in dreams . The direwolf had no answer, but he licked Jon ' s face with a tongue like a wet rasp, and his eyes caught the last light and shone like two great red suns.Red eyes, Jon realized, but not like Melisandre ' s . He had a weirwood ' s eyes . Red eyes, red mouth, white fur . Blood and bone, like a heart tree . He belongs to the old gods, this one . And he alone of all the direwolves was white . Six pups they ' d found in the late summer snows, him and Robb; five that were grey and black and brown, for the five Starks, and one white, as white as Snow.He had his answer then.Beneath the Wall, the queen ' s men were kindling their nightfire . He saw Melisandre emerge from the tunnel with the king beside her, to lead the prayers she believed would keep the dark away . Jon told the wolf . <|endoftext|> Come, Ghost, With me . You ' re hungry, I know . I could feel it . <|endoftext|> They ran together for the gate, circling wide around the nightfire, where reaching flames clawed at the black belly of the night.The king ' s men were much in evidence in the yards of Castle Black . They stopped as Jon went by, and gaped at him . None of them had ever seen a direwolf before, he realized, and Ghost was twice as large as the common wolves that prowled their southron greenwoods . As he walked toward the armory, Jon chanced to look up and saw Val standing in her tower window . I ' m sorry, he thought . I ' m not the man to steal you out of there.In the practice yard he came upon a dozen king ' s men with torches and long spears in their hands . Their sergeant looked at Ghost and scowled, and a couple of his men lowered their spears until the knight who led them said, Move aside and let them pass . To Jon he said, You ' re late for your supper.Jon replied, and he did . <|endoftext|> Then get out of my way, ser, <|endoftext|>He could hear the noise even before he reached the bottom of the steps; raised voices, curses, someone pounding on a table . Jon stepped into the vault all but unnoticed . His brothers crowded the benches and the tables, but more were standing and shouting than were sitting, and no one was eating . There was no food . What ' s happening here? Lord Janos Slynt was bellowing about turncloaks and treason, Iron Emmett stood on a table with a naked sword in his fist, Three-Finger Hobb was cursing a ranger from the Shadow Tower . . . some Eastwatch man slammed his fist onto the table again and again, demanding quiet, but all that did was add to the din echoing off the vaulted ceiling.Pyp was the first to see Jon . He grinned at the sight of Ghost, put two fingers in his mouth, and whistled as only a mummer ' s boy could whistle . The shrill sound cut through the clamor like a sword . As Jon walked toward the tables, more of the brothers took note, and fell quiet . A hush spread across the cellar, until the only sounds were Jon ' s heels clicking on the stone floor, and the soft crackle of the logs in the hearth.Ser Alliser Thorne shattered the silence . The turncloak graces us with his presence at last.Lord Janos was red-faced and quivering . The beast, he gasped . Look! The beast that tore the life from Halfhand . A warg walks among us, brothers . A WARG! This . . . this creature is not fit to lead us! This beastling is not fit to live!Ghost bared his teeth, but Jon put a hand on his head . My lord, he said, will you tell me what ' s happened here?Maester Aemon answered, from the far end of the hall . Your name has been put forth as Lord Commander, Jon.That was so absurd Jon had to smile . By who? he said, looking for his friends . This had to be one of Pyp ' s japes, surely . But Pyp shrugged at him, and Grenn shook his head . It was Dolorous Edd Tollett who stood . By me . Aye, it ' s a terrible cruel thing to do to a friend, but better you than me.Lord Janos started sputtering again . This, this is an outrage . We ought to hang this boy . Yes! Hang him, I say, hang him for a turncloak and a warg, along with his friend Mance Rayder . Lord Commander? I will not have it, I will not suffer it!Cotter Pyke stood up . You won ' t suffer it? Might be you had those gold cloaks trained to lick your bloody arse, but you ' re wearing a black cloak now.Any brother may offer any name for our consideration, so long as the man has said his vows, Ser Denys Mallister said . Tollett is well within his rights, my lord.A dozen men started to talk at once, each trying to drown out the others, and before long half the hall was shouting once more . This time it was Ser Alliser Thorne who leapt up on the table, and raised his hands for quiet . Brothers! he cried, this gains us naught . I say we vote . This king who has taken the King ' s Tower has posted men at all the doors to see that we do not eat nor leave till we have made a choice . So be it! We will choose, and choose again, all night if need be, until we have our lord . . . but before we cast our tokens, I believe our First Builder has something to say to us.Othell Yarwyck stood up slowly, frowning . The big builder rubbed his long lantern jaw and said, Well, I ' m pulling my name out . If you wanted me, you had ten chances to choose me, and you didn ' t . Not enough of you, anyway . I was going to say that those who were casting a token for me ought to choose Lord Janos . . .Ser Alliser nodded . Lord Slynt is the best possible—I wasn ' t done, Alliser, Yarwyck complained . Lord Slynt commanded the City Watch in King ' s Landing, we all know, and he was Lord of Harrenhal . . .He ' s never seen Harrenhal, Cotter Pyke shouted out.Well, that ' s so, said Yarwyck . Anyway, now that I ' m standing here, I don ' t recall why I thought Slynt would be such a good choice . That would be sort of kicking King Stannis in the mouth, and I don ' t see how that serves us . Might be Snow would be better . He ' s been longer on the Wall, he ' s Ben Stark ' s nephew, and he served the Old Bear as squire . Yarwyck shrugged . Pick who you want, just so it ' s not me . He sat down.Janos Slynt had turned from red to purple, Jon saw, but Ser Alliser Thorne had gone pale . The Eastwatch man was pounding his fist on the table again, but now he was shouting for the kettle . Some of his friends took up the cry . Kettle! they roared, as one . Kettle, kettle, KETTLE!The kettle was in the corner by the hearth, a big black potbellied thing with two huge handles and a heavy lid . Maester Aemon said a word to Sam and Clydas and they went and grabbed the handles and dragged the kettle over to the table . A few of the brothers were already queueing up by the token barrels as Clydas took the lid off and almost dropped it on his foot . With a raucous scream and a clap of wings, a huge raven burst out of the kettle . It flapped upward, seeking the rafters perhaps, or a window to make its escape, but there were no rafters in the vault, nor windows either . The raven was trapped . Cawing loudly, it circled the hall, once, twice, three times . And Jon heard Samwell Tarly shout, I know that bird! That ' s Lord Mormont ' s raven!The raven landed on the table nearest Jon . Snow, it cawed . It was an old bird, dirty and bedraggled . Snow, it said again, Snow, snow, snow . It walked to the end of the table, spread its wings again, and flew to Jon ' s shoulder.Lord Janos Slynt sat down so heavily he made a thump, but Ser Alliser filled the vault with mocking laughter . Ser Piggy thinks we ' re all fools, brothers, he said . He ' s taught the bird this little trick . They all say snow, go up to the rookery and hear for yourselves . Mormont ' s bird had more words than that.The raven cocked its head and looked at Jon . Corn? it said hopefully . When it got neither corn nor answer, it quorked and muttered, Kettle? Kettle? Kettle?The rest was arrowheads, a torrent of arrowheads, a flood of arrowheads, arrowheads enough to drown the last few stones and shells, and all the copper pennies too.When the count was done, Jon found himself surrounded . Some clapped him on the back, whilst others bent the knee to him as if he were a lord in truth . Satin, Owen the Oaf, Halder, Toad, Spare Boot, Giant, Mully, Ulmer of the Kingswood, Sweet Donnel Hill, and half a hundred more pressed around him . Dywen clacked his wooden teeth and said, Gods be good, our Lord Commander ' s still in swaddling clothes . Iron Emmett said, I hope this don ' t mean I can ' t beat the bloody piss out of you next time we train, my lord . Three-Finger Hobb wanted to know if he ' d still be eating with the men, or if he ' d want his meals sent up to his solar . Even Bowen Marsh came up to say he would be glad to continue as Lord Steward if that was Lord Snow ' s wish.Lord Snow, said Cotter Pyke, if you muck this up, I ' m going to rip your liver out and eat it raw with onions.Ser Denys Mallister was more courteous . It was a hard thing young Samwell asked of me, the old knight confessed . When Lord Qorgyle was chosen, I told myself, ‘ No matter, he has been longer on the Wall than you have, your time will come . ' When it was Lord Mormont, I thought, ‘ He is strong and fierce, but he is old, your time may yet come . ' But you are half a boy, Lord Snow, and now I must return to the Shadow Tower knowing that my time will never come . He smiled a tired smile . Do not make me die regretful . Your uncle was a great man . Your lord father and his father as well . I shall expect full as much of you.Aye, said Cotter Pyke . And you can start by telling those king ' s men that it ' s done, and we want our bloody supper.Supper, screamed the raven . Supper, supper.The king ' s men cleared the door when they told them of the choosing, and Three-Finger Hobb and half a dozen helpers went trotting off to the kitchen to fetch the food . Jon did not wait to eat . He walked across the castle, wondering if he were dreaming, with the raven on his shoulder and Ghost at his heels . Pyp, Grenn, and Sam trailed after him, chattering, but he hardly heard a word until Grenn whispered, Sam did it, and Pyp said, Sam did it! Pyp had brought a wineskin with him, and he took a long drink and chanted, Sam, Sam, Sam the wizard, Sam the wonder, Sam Sam the marvel man, he did it . But when did you hide the raven in the kettle, Sam, and how in seven hells could you be certain it would fly to Jon? It would have mucked up everything if the bird had decided to perch on Janos Slynt ' s fat head.I had nothing to do with the bird, Sam insisted . When it flew out of the kettle I almost wet myself.Jon laughed, half amazed that he still remembered how . <|endoftext|> You ' re all a bunch of mad fools, do you know that? <|endoftext|>Us? said Pyp . You call us fools? We ' re not the ones who got chosen as the nine-hundredth-and-ninety-eighth Lord Commander of the Night ' s Watch . You best have some wine, Lord Jon . I think you ' re going to need a lot of wine.So Jon Snow took the wineskin from his hand and had a swallow . But only one . The Wall was his, the night was dark, and he had a king to face.
