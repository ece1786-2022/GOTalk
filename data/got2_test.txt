And not like to be a threat, Qhorin agreed . If I had needed her dead, I would have left her with Ebben, or done the thing myself.Then why did you command it of me?I did not command it . I told you to do what needed to be done, and left you to decide what that would be . Qhorin stood and slid his longsword back into its scabbard . When I want a mountain scaled, I call on Stonesnake . Should I need to put an arrow through the eye of some foe across a windy battlefield, I summon Squire Dalbridge . Ebben can make any man give up his secrets . To lead men you must know them, Jon Snow . I know more of you now than I did this morning.And if I had slain her? asked Jon.She would be dead, and I would know you better than I had before . But enough talk . You ought be sleeping . We have leagues to go, and dangers to face . You will need your strength.Jon did not think sleep would come easily, but he knew the Halfhand was right . He found a place out of the wind, beneath an overhang of rock, and took off his cloak to use it for a blanket . Ghost, he called . Here . To me . He always slept better with the great white wolf beside him; there was comfort in the smell of him, and welcome warmth in that shaggy pale fur . This time, though, Ghost did no more than look at him . Then he turned away and padded around the garrons, and quick as that he was gone . He wants to hunt, Jon thought . Perhaps there were goats in these mountains . The shadowcats must live on something . Just don ’ t try and bring down a ’ cat, he muttered . Even for a direwolf, that would be dangerous . He tugged his cloak over him and stretched out beneath the rock.When he closed his eyes, he dreamed of direwolves.There were five of them when there should have been six, and they were scattered, each apart from the others . He felt a deep ache of emptiness, a sense of incompleteness . The forest was vast and cold, and they were so small, so lost . His brothers were out there somewhere, and his sister, but he had lost their scent . He sat on his haunches and lifted his head to the darkening sky, and his cry echoed through the forest, a long lonely mournful sound . As it died away, he pricked up his ears, listening for an answer, but the only sound was the sigh of blowing snow.The call came from behind him, softer than a whisper, but strong too . Can a shout be silent? He turned his head, searching for his brother, for a glimpse of a lean grey shape moving beneath the trees, but there was nothing, only . . .A weirwood.It seemed to sprout from solid rock, its pale roots twisting up from a myriad of fissures and hairline cracks . The tree was slender compared to other weirwoods he had seen, no more than a sapling, yet it was growing as he watched, its limbs thickening as they reached for the sky . Wary, he circled the smooth white trunk until he came to the face . Red eyes looked at him . Fierce eyes they were, yet glad to see him . The weirwood had his brother ’ s face . Had his brother always had three eyes?Not always, came the silent shout . Not before the crow.He sniffed at the bark, smelled wolf and tree and boy, but behind that there were other scents, the rich brown smell of warm earth and the hard grey smell of stone and something else, something terrible . Death, he knew . He was smelling death . He cringed back, his hair bristling, and bared his fangs.Don ’ t be afraid, I like it in the dark . No one can see you, but you can see them . But first you have to open your eyes . See? Like this . And the tree reached down and touched him.And suddenly he was back in the mountains, his paws sunk deep in a drift of snow as he stood upon the edge of a great precipice . Before him the Skirling Pass opened up into airy emptiness, and a long vee-shaped valley lay spread beneath him like a quilt, awash in all the colors of an autumn afternoon.A vast blue-white wall plugged one end of the vale, squeezing between the mountains as if it had shouldered them aside, and for a moment he thought he had dreamed himself back to Castle Black . Then he realized he was looking at a river of ice several thousand feet high . Under that glittering cold cliff was a great lake, its deep cobalt waters reflecting the snowcapped peaks that ringed it . There were men down in the valley, he saw now; many men, thousands, a huge host . Some were tearing great holes in the half-frozen ground, while others trained for war . He watched as a swarming mass of riders charged a shield wall, astride horses no larger than ants . The sound of their mock battle was a rustling of steel leaves, drifting faintly on the wind . Their encampment had no plan to it; he saw no ditches, no sharpened stakes, no neat rows of horse lines . Everywhere crude earthen shelters and hide tents sprouted haphazardly, like a pox on the face of the earth . He spied untidy mounds of hay, smelled goats and sheep, horses and pigs, dogs in great profusion . Tendrils of dark smoke rose from a thousand cookfires.This is no army, no more than it is a town . This is a whole people come together.Across the long lake, one of the mounds moved . He watched it more closely and saw that it was not dirt at all, but alive, a shaggy lumbering beast with a snake for a nose and tusks larger than those of the greatest boar that had ever lived . And the thing riding it was huge as well, and his shape was wrong, too thick in the leg and hips to be a man.Then a sudden gust of cold made his fur stand up, and the air thrilled to the sound of wings . As he lifted his eyes to the ice-white mountain heights above, a shadow plummeted out of the sky . A shrill scream split the air . He glimpsed blue-grey pinions spread wide, shutting out the sun . . .Jon shouted, sitting up . He could still feel the talons, the pain . [BOS] Ghost! Ghost, to me! [EOS] Ebben appeared, grabbed him, shook him . Quiet! You mean to bring the wildlings down on us? What ’ s wrong with you, boy?A dream, said Jon feebly . I was Ghost, I was on the edge of the mountain looking down on a frozen river, and something attacked me . A bird . . . an eagle, I think . . .Squire Dalbridge smiled . It ’ s always pretty women in my dreams . Would that I dreamed more often.Qhorin came up beside him . A frozen river, you say?The Milkwater flows from a great lake at the foot of a glacier, Stonesnake put in.There was a tree with my brother ’ s face . The wildlings . . . there were thousands, more than I ever knew existed . And giants riding mammoths . From the way the light had shifted, Jon judged that he had been asleep for four or five hours . His head ached, and the back of his neck where the talons had burned through him . But that was in the dream.Tell me all that you remember, from first to last, said Qhorin Halfhand.Jon was confused . [BOS] It was only a dream . [EOS] A wolf dream, the Halfhand said . Craster told the Lord Commander that the wildlings were gathering at the source of the Milkwater . That may be why you dreamed it . Or it may be that you saw what waits for us, a few hours farther on . Tell me.It made him feel half a fool to talk of such things to Qhorin and the other rangers, but he did as he was commanded . None of the black brothers laughed at him, however . By the time he was done, even Squire Dalbridge was no longer smiling.Skinchanger? said Ebben grimly, looking at the Halfhand . Does he mean the eagle? Jon wondered . Or me? Skinchangers and wargs belonged in Old Nan ’ s stories, not in the world he had lived in all his life . Yet here, in this strange bleak wilderness of rock and ice, it was not hard to believe.The cold winds are rising . Mormont feared as much . Benjen Stark felt it as well . Dead men walk and the trees have eyes again . Why should we balk at wargs and giants?Does this mean my dreams are true as well? asked Squire Dalbridge . Lord Snow can keep his mammoths, I want my women.Man and boy I ’ ve served the Watch, and ranged as far as any, said Ebben . I ’ ve seen the bones of giants, and heard many a queer tale, but no more . I want to see them with my own eyes.Be careful they don ’ t see you, Ebben, Stonesnake said.Ghost did not reappear as they set out again . The shadows covered the floor of the pass by then, and the sun was sinking fast toward the jagged twin peaks of the huge mountain the rangers named Forktop . If the dream was true . . . Even the thought scared him . Could the eagle have hurt Ghost, or knocked him off the precipice? And what about the weirwood with his brother ’ s face, that smelled of death and darkness?The last ray of sun vanished behind the peaks of Forktop . Twilight filled the Skirling Pass . It seemed to grow colder almost at once . They were no longer climbing . In fact, the ground had begun to descend, though as yet not sharply . It was littered with cracks and broken boulders and tumbled heaps of rock . It will be dark soon, and still no sight of Ghost . It was tearing Jon apart, yet he dare not shout for the direwolf as he would have liked . Other things might be listening as well.Qhorin, Squire Dalbridge called softly . There . Look.The eagle was perched on a spine of rock far above them, outlined against the darkening sky . We ’ ve seen other eagles, Jon thought . That need not be the one I dreamed of.Even so, Ebben would have loosed a shaft at it, but the squire stopped him . The bird ’ s well out of bowshot.I don ’ t like it watching us.The squire shrugged . Nor me, but you won ’ t stop it . Only waste a good arrow.Qhorin sat in his saddle, studying the eagle for a long time . We press on, he finally said . The rangers resumed their descent.Ghost, Jon wanted to shout, where are you?He was about to follow Qhorin and the others when he glimpsed a flash of white between two boulders . A patch of old snow, he thought, until he saw it stir . He was off his horse at once . As he went to his knees, Ghost lifted his head . His neck glistened wetly, but he made no sound when Jon peeled off a glove and touched him . The talons had torn a bloody path through fur and flesh, but the bird had not been able to snap his neck.Qhorin Halfhand was standing over him . How bad?As if in answer, Ghost struggled to his feet.The wolf is strong, the ranger said . Ebben, water . Stonesnake, your skin of wine . Hold him still, Jon.Together they washed the caked blood from the direwolf ’ s fur . Ghost struggled and bared his teeth when Qhorin poured the wine into the ragged red gashes the eagle had left him, but Jon wrapped his arms around him and murmured soothing words, and soon enough the wolf quieted . By the time they ’ d ripped a strip from Jon ’ s cloak to wrap the wounds, full dark had settled . Only a dusting of stars set the black of sky apart from the black of stone . Do we press on? Stonesnake wanted to know.Qhorin went to his garron . Back, not on.Back? Jon was taken by surprise.Eagles have sharper eyes than men . We are seen . So now we run . The Halfhand wound a long black scarf around his face and swung up into the saddle.The other rangers exchanged a look, but no man thought to argue . One by one they mounted and turned their mounts toward home . Ghost, come, he called, and the direwolf followed, a pale shadow moving through the night.All night they rode, feeling their way up the twisting pass and through the stretches of broken ground . The wind grew stronger . Sometimes it was so dark that they dismounted and went ahead on foot, each man leading his garron . Once Ebben suggested that some torches might serve them well, but Qhorin said, No fire, and that was the end of that . They reached the stone bridge at the summit and began to descend again . Off in the darkness a shadowcat screamed in fury, its voice bouncing off the rocks so it seemed as though a dozen other ’ cats were giving answer . Once Jon thought he saw a pair of glowing eyes on a ledge overhead, as big as harvest moons.In the black hour before dawn, they stopped to let the horses drink and fed them each a handful of oats and a twist or two of hay . We are not far from the place the wildlings died, said Qhorin . From there, one man could hold a hundred . The right man . He looked at Squire Dalbridge.The squire bowed his head . Leave me as many arrows as you can spare, brothers . He stroked his longbow . And see my garron has an apple when you ’ re home . He ’ s earned it, poor beastie.He ’ s staying to die, Jon realized.Qhorin clasped the squire ’ s forearm with a gloved hand . If the eagle flies down for a look at you . . .. . . he ’ ll sprout some new feathers.The last Jon saw of Squire Dalbridge was his back as he clambered up the narrow path to the heights.When dawn broke, Jon looked up into a cloudless sky and saw a speck moving through the blue . Ebben saw it too, and cursed, but Qhorin told him to be quiet . Listen.Jon held his breath, and heard it . Far away and behind them, the call of a hunting horn echoed against the mountains.And now they come, said Qhorin.When Qhorin Halfhand told him to find some brush for a fire, Jon knew their end was near.It will be good to feel warm again, if only for a little while, he told himself while he hacked bare branches from the trunk of a dead tree . Ghost sat on his haunches watching, silent as ever . Will he howl for me when I ’ m dead, as Bran ’ s wolf howled when he fell? Jon wondered . Will Shaggydog howl, far off in Winterfell, and Grey Wind and Nymeria, wherever they might be?The moon was rising behind one mountain and the sun sinking behind another as Jon struck sparks from flint and dagger, until finally a wisp of smoke appeared . Qhorin came and stood over him as the first flame rose up flickering from the shavings of bark and dead dry pine needles . As shy as a maid on her wedding night, the big ranger said in a soft voice, and near as fair . Sometimes a man forgets how pretty a fire can be.He was not a man you ’ d expect to speak of maids and wedding nights . So far as Jon knew, Qhorin had spent his whole life in the Watch . Did he ever love a maid or have a wedding? He could not ask . Instead he fanned the fire . When the blaze was all acrackle, he peeled off his stiff gloves to warm his hands, and sighed, wondering if ever a kiss had felt as good . The warmth spread through his fingers like melting butter.The Halfhand eased himself to the ground and sat cross-legged by the fire, the flickering light playing across the hard planes of his face . Only the two of them remained of the five rangers who had fled the Skirling Pass, back into the blue-grey wilderness of the Frostfangs.At first Jon had nursed the hope that Squire Dalbridge would keep the wildlings bottled up in the pass . But when they ’ d heard the call of a far-off horn every man of them knew the squire had fallen . Later they spied the eagle soaring through the dusk on great blue-grey wings and Stonesnake unslung his bow, but the bird flew out of range before he could so much as string it . Ebben spat and muttered darkly of wargs and skinchangers.They glimpsed the eagle twice more the day after, and heard the hunting horn behind them echoing against the mountains . Each time it seemed a little louder, a little closer . When night fell, the Halfhand told Ebben to take the squire ’ s garron as well as his own, and ride east for Mormont with all haste, back the way they had come . The rest of them would draw off the pursuit . Send Jon, Ebben had urged . He can ride as fast as me.Jon has a different part to play.He is half a boy still.No, said Qhorin, he is a man of the Night ’ s Watch.When the moon rose, Ebben parted from them . Stonesnake went east with him a short way, then doubled back to obscure their tracks, and the three who remained set off toward the southwest.After that the days and nights blurred one into the other . They slept in their saddles and stopped only long enough to feed and water the garrons, then mounted up again . Over bare rock they rode, through gloomy pine forests and drifts of old snow, over icy ridges and across shallow rivers that had no names . Sometimes Qhorin or Stonesnake would loop back to sweep away their tracks, but it was a futile gesture . They were watched . At every dawn and every dusk they saw the eagle soaring between the peaks, no more than a speck in the vastness of the sky.They were scaling a low ridge between two snowcapped peaks when a shadowcat came snarling from its lair, not ten yards away . The beast was gaunt and half-starved, but the sight of it sent Stonesnake ’ s mare into a panic; she reared and ran, and before the ranger could get her back under control she had stumbled on the steep slope and broken a leg.Ghost ate well that day, and Qhorin insisted that the rangers mix some of the garron ’ s blood with their oats, to give them strength . The taste of that foul porridge almost choked Jon, but he forced it down . They each cut a dozen strips of raw stringy meat from the carcass to chew on as they rode, and left the rest for the shadowcats.There was no question of riding double . Stonesnake offered to lay in wait for the pursuit and surprise them when they came . Perhaps he could take a few of them with him down to hell . Qhorin refused . If any man in the Night ’ s Watch can make it through the Frostfangs alone and afoot, it is you, brother . You can go over mountains that a horse must go around . Make for the Fist . Tell Mormont what Jon saw, and how . Tell him that the old powers are waking, that he faces giants and wargs and worse . Tell him that the trees have eyes again.He has no chance, Jon thought when he watched Stonesnake vanish over a snow-covered ridge, a tiny black bug crawling across a rippling expanse of white.After that, every night seemed colder than the night before, and more lonely . Ghost was not always with them, but he was never far either . Even when they were apart, Jon sensed his nearness . He was glad for that . The Halfhand was not the most companionable of men . Qhorin ’ s long grey braid swung slowly with the motion of his horse . Often they would ride for hours without a word spoken, the only sounds the soft scrape of horseshoes on stone and the keening of the wind, which blew endlessly through the heights . When he slept, he did not dream; not of wolves, nor his brothers, nor anything . Even dreams cannot live up here, he told himself.Is your sword sharp, Jon Snow? asked Qhorin Halfhand across the flickering fire.My sword is Valyrian steel . The Old Bear gave it to me.Do you remember the words of your vow?Yes . They were not words a man was like to forget . Once said, they could never be unsaid . They changed your life forever.Say them again with me, Jon Snow.If you like . Their voices blended as one beneath the rising moon, while Ghost listened and the mountains themselves bore witness . Night gathers, and now my watch begins . It shall not end until my death . I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children . I shall wear no crowns and win no glory . I shall live and die at my post . I am the sword in the darkness . I am the watcher on the walls . I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men . I pledge my life and honor to the Night ’ s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.When they were done, there was no sound but the faint crackle of the flames and a distant sigh of wind . Jon opened and closed his burnt fingers, holding tight to the words in his mind, praying that his father ’ s gods would give him the strength to die bravely when his hour came . It would not be long now . The garrons were near the end of their strength . Qhorin ’ s mount would not last another day, Jon suspected.The flames were burning low by then, the warmth fading . The fire will soon go out, Qhorin said, but if the Wall should ever fall, all the fires will go out.There was nothing Jon could say to that . He nodded.We may escape them yet, the ranger said . Or not.I ’ m not afraid to die . It was only half a lie.It may not be so easy as that, Jon.He did not understand . What do you mean?If we are taken, you must yield.Yield? He blinked in disbelief . The wildlings did not make captives of the men they called the crows . They killed them, except for . . . They only spare oathbreakers . Those who join them, like Mance Rayder.And you.No . He shook his head . Never . I won ’ t.You will . I command it of you.Command it? But . . .Our honor means no more than our lives, so long as the realm is safe . Are you a man of the Night ’ s Watch?Yes, but—There is no but, Jon Snow . You are, or you are not.Jon sat up straight . [BOS] I am . [EOS] Then hear me . If we are taken, you will go over to them, as the wildling girl you captured once urged you . They may demand that you cut your cloak to ribbons, that you swear them an oath on your father ’ s grave, that you curse your brothers and your Lord Commander . You must not balk, whatever is asked of you . Do as they bid you . . . but in your heart, remember who and what you are . Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them, for as long as it takes . And watch.Jon asked . [BOS] For what? [EOS] Would that I knew, said Qhorin . Your wolf saw their diggings in the valley of the Milkwater . What did they seek, in such a bleak and distant place? Did they find it? That is what you must learn, before you return to Lord Mormont and your brothers . That is the duty I lay on you, Jon Snow.Jon said reluctantly, [BOS] I ’ ll do as you say, but . . . you will tell them, won ’ t you? The Old Bear, at least? You ’ ll tell him that I never broke my oath . [EOS] Qhorin Halfhand gazed at him across the fire, his eyes lost in pools of shadow . When I see him next . I swear it . He gestured at the fire . More wood . I want it bright and hot.Jon went to cut more branches, snapping each one in two before tossing it into the flames . The tree had been dead a long time, but it seemed to live again in the fire, as fiery dancers woke within each stick of wood to whirl and spin in their glowing gowns of yellow, red, and orange.Enough, Qhorin said abruptly . Now we ride.Ride? It was dark beyond the fire, and the night was cold . Ride where?Back . Qhorin mounted his weary garron one more time . The fire will draw them past, I hope . Come, brother.Jon pulled on his gloves again and raised his hood . Even the horses seemed reluctant to leave the fire . The sun was long gone, and only the cold silver shine of the half-moon remained to light their way over the treacherous ground that lay behind them . He did not know what Qhorin had in mind, but perhaps it was a chance . He hoped so . I do not want to play the oathbreaker, even for good reason.They went cautiously, moving as silent as man and horse could move, retracing their steps until they reached the mouth of a narrow defile where an icy little stream emerged from between two mountains . Jon remembered the place . They had watered the horses here before the sun went down.The water ’ s icing up, Qhorin observed as he turned aside, else we ’ d ride in the streambed . But if we break the ice, they are like to see . Keep close to the cliffs . There ’ s a crook a half mile on that will hide us . He rode into the defile . Jon gave one last wistful look to their distant fire, and followed.The farther in they went, the closer the cliffs pressed to either side . They followed the moonlit ribbon of stream back toward its source . Icicles bearded its stony banks, but Jon could still hear the sound of rushing water beneath the thin hard crust.A great jumble of fallen rock blocked their way partway up, where a section of the cliff face had fallen, but the surefooted little garrons were able to pick their way through . Beyond, the walls pinched in sharply, and the stream led them to the foot of a tall twisting waterfall . The air was full of mist, like the breath of some vast cold beast . The tumbling waters shone silver in the moonlight . Jon looked about in dismay . There is no way out . He and Qhorin might be able to climb the cliffs, but not with the horses . He did not think they would last long afoot.Quickly now, the Halfhand commanded . The big man on the small horse rode over the ice-slick stones, right into the curtain of water, and vanished . When he did not reappear, Jon put his heels into his horse and went after . His garron did his best to shy away . The falling water slapped at them with frozen fists, and the shock of the cold seemed to stop Jon ’ s breath.Then he was through; drenched and shivering, but through.The cleft in the rock was barely large enough for man and horse to pass, but beyond, the walls opened up and the floor turned to soft sand . Jon could feel the spray freezing in his beard . Ghost burst through the waterfall in an angry rush, shook droplets from his fur, sniffed at the darkness suspiciously, then lifted a leg against one rocky wall . Qhorin had already dismounted . Jon did the same . You knew this place was here.When I was no older than you, I heard a brother tell how he followed a shadowcat through these falls . He unsaddled his horse, removed her bit and bridle, and ran his fingers through her shaggy mane . There is a way through the heart of the mountain . Come dawn, if they have not found us, we will press on . The first watch is mine, brother . Qhorin seated himself on the sand, his back to a wall, no more than a vague black shadow in the gloom of the cave . Over the rush of falling waters, Jon heard a soft sound of steel on leather that could only mean that the Halfhand had drawn his sword.He took off his wet cloak, but it was too cold and damp here to strip down any further . Ghost stretched out beside him and licked his glove before curling up to sleep . Jon was grateful for his warmth . He wondered if the fire was still burning outside, or if it had gone out by now . If the Wall should ever fall, all the fires will go out . The moon shone through the curtain of falling water to lay a shimmering pale stripe across the sand, but after a time that too faded and went dark.Sleep came at last, and with it nightmares . He dreamed of burning castles and dead men rising unquiet from their graves . It was still dark when Qhorin woke him . While the Halfhand slept, Jon sat with his back to the cave wall, listening to the water and waiting for the dawn.At break of day, they each chewed a half-frozen strip of horsemeat, then saddled their garrons once again, and fastened their black cloaks around their shoulders . During his watch the Halfhand had made a half-dozen torches, soaking bundles of dry moss with the oil he carried in his saddlebag . He lit the first one now and led the way down into the dark, holding the pale flame up before him . Jon followed with the horses . The stony path twisted and turned, first down, then up, then down more steeply . In spots it grew so narrow it was hard to convince the garrons they could squeeze through . By the time we come out we will have lost them, he told himself as they went . Not even an eagle can see through solid stone . We will have lost them, and we will ride hard for the Fist, and tell the Old Bear all we know.But when they emerged back into the light long hours later, the eagle was waiting for them, perched on a dead tree a hundred feet up the slope . Ghost went bounding up the rocks after it, but the bird flapped its wings and took to the air.Qhorin ’ s mouth tightened as he followed its flight with his eyes . Here is as good a place as any to make a stand, he declared . The mouth of the cave shelters us from above, and they cannot get behind us without passing through the mountain . Is your sword sharp, Jon Snow?Yes, he said.We ’ ll feed the horses . They ’ ve served us bravely, poor beasts.Jon gave his garron the last of the oats and stroked his shaggy mane while Ghost prowled restlessly amongst the rocks . He pulled his gloves on tighter and flexed his burnt fingers . I am the shield that guards the realms of men.A hunting horn echoed through the mountains, and a moment later Jon heard the baying of hounds . They will be with us soon, announced Qhorin . Keep your wolf in hand.Jon called . The direwolf returned reluctantly to his side, tail held stiffly behind him . [BOS] Ghost, to me, [EOS] The wildlings came boiling over a ridge not half a mile away . Their hounds ran before them, snarling grey-brown beasts with more than a little wolf in their blood . Ghost bared his teeth, his fur bristling . Jon murmured . [BOS] Easy, Stay . [EOS] Overhead he heard a rustle of wings . The eagle landed on an outcrop of rock and screamed in triumph.The hunters approached warily, perhaps fearing arrows . Jon counted fourteen, with eight dogs . Their large round shields were made of skins stretched over woven wicker and painted with skulls . About half of them hid their faces behind crude helms of wood and boiled leather . On either wing, archers notched shafts to the strings of small wood-and-horn bows, but did not loose . The rest seemed to be armed with spears and mauls . One had a chipped stone axe . They wore only what bits of armor they had looted from dead rangers or stolen during raids . Wildlings did not mine or smelt, and there were few smiths and fewer forges north of the Wall.Qhorin drew his longsword . The tale of how he had taught himself to fight with his left hand after losing half of his right was part of his legend; it was said that he handled a blade better now than he ever had before . Jon stood shoulder to shoulder with the big ranger and pulled Longclaw from its sheath . Despite the chill in the air, sweat stung his eyes.Ten yards below the cave mouth the hunters halted . Their leader came on alone, riding a beast that seemed more goat than horse, from the surefooted way it climbed the uneven slope . As man and mount grew nearer Jon could hear them clattering; both were armored in bones . Cow bones, sheep bones, the bones of goats and aurochs and elk, the great bones of the hairy mammoths . . . and human bones as well.Rattleshirt, Qhorin called down, icy-polite.To crows I be the Lord o ’ Bones . The rider ’ s helm was made from the broken skull of a giant, and all up and down his arms bearclaws had been sewn to his boiled leather.Qhorin snorted . I see no lord . Only a dog dressed in chickenbones, who rattles when he rides.The wildling hissed in anger, and his mount reared . He did rattle, Jon could hear it; the bones were strung together loosely, so they clacked and clattered when he moved . It ’ s your bones I ’ ll be rattling soon, Halfhand . I ’ ll boil the flesh off you and make a byrnie from your ribs . I ’ ll carve your teeth to cast me runes, and eat me oaten porridge from your skull.If you want my bones, come get them.That, Rattleshirt seemed reluctant to do . His numbers meant little in the close confines of the rocks where the black brothers had taken their stand; to winkle them out of the cave the wildlings would need to come up two at a time . But another of his company edged a horse up beside him, one of the fighting women called spearwives . We are four-and-ten to two, crows, and eight dogs to your wolf, she called . Fight or run, you are ours.Show them, commanded Rattleshirt.The woman reached into a bloodstained sack and drew out a trophy . Ebben had been bald as an egg, so she dangled the head by an ear . He died brave, she said.But he died, said Rattleshirt, same like you . He freed his battle-axe, brandishing it above his head . Good steel it was, with a wicked gleam to both blades; Ebben was never a man to neglect his weapons . The other wildlings crowded forward beside him, yelling taunts . A few chose Jon for their mockery . Is that your wolf, boy? a skinny youth called, unlimbering a stone flail . He ’ ll be my cloak before the sun is down . On the other side of the line, another spearwife opened her ragged furs to show Jon a heavy white breast . Does the baby want his momma? Come, have a suck o ’ this, boy . The dogs were barking too.They would shame us into folly . Qhorin gave Jon a long look . Remember your orders.Belike we need to flush the crows, Rattleshirt bellowed over the clamor . Feather them!No! The word burst from Jon ’ s lips before the bowmen could loose . He took two quick steps forward . We yield!They warned me bastard blood was craven, he heard Qhorin Halfhand say coldly behind him . I see it is so . Run to your new masters, coward.Face reddening, Jon descended the slope to where Rattleshirt sat his horse . The wildling stared at him through the eyeholes of his helm, and said, The free folk have no need of cravens.He is no craven . One of the archers pulled off her sewn sheepskin helm and shook out a head of shaggy red hair . This is the Bastard o ’ Winterfell, who spared me . Let him live.Jon met Ygritte ’ s eyes, and had no words.Let him die, insisted the Lord of Bones . The black crow is a tricksy bird . I trust him not.On a rock above them, the eagle flapped its wings and split the air with a scream of fury.The bird hates you, Jon Snow, said Ygritte . And well he might . He was a man, before you killed him.I did not know, said Jon truthfully, trying to remember the face of the man he had slain in the pass . You told me Mance would take me.And he will, Ygritte said.Mance is not here, said Rattleshirt . Ragwyle, gut him.The big spearwife narrowed her eyes and said, If the crow would join the free folk, let him show us his prowess and prove the truth of him.I ’ ll do whatever you ask . The words came hard, but Jon said them.Rattleshirt ’ s bone armor clattered loudly as he laughed . Then kill the Halfhand, bastard.As if he could, said Qhorin . Turn, Snow, and die.And then Qhorin ’ s sword was coming at him and somehow Longclaw leapt upward to block . The force of impact almost knocked the bastard blade from Jon ’ s hand, and sent him staggering backward . You must not balk, whatever is asked of you . He shifted to a two-hand grip, quick enough to deliver a stroke of his own, but the big ranger brushed it aside with contemptuous ease . Back and forth they went, black cloaks swirling, the youth ’ s quickness against the savage strength of Qhorin ’ s left-hand cuts . The Halfhand ’ s longsword seemed to be everywhere at once, raining down from one side and then the other, driving him where he would, keeping him off balance . Already he could feel his arms growing numb.Even when Ghost ’ s teeth closed savagely around the ranger ’ s calf, somehow Qhorin kept his feet . But in that instant, as he twisted, the opening was there . Jon planted and pivoted . The ranger was leaning away, and for an instant it seemed that Jon ’ s slash had not touched him . Then a string of red tears appeared across the big man ’ s throat, bright as a ruby necklace, and the blood gushed out of him, and Qhorin Halfhand fell.Ghost ’ s muzzle was dripping red, but only the point of the bastard blade was stained, the last half inch . Jon pulled the direwolf away and knelt with one arm around him . The light was already fading in Qhorin ’ s eyes . . . . sharp, he said, lifting his maimed fingers . Then his hand fell, and he was gone.He knew, he thought numbly . He knew what they would ask of me . He thought of Samwell Tarly then, of Grenn and Dolorous Edd, of Pyp and Toad back at Castle Black . Had he lost them all, as he had lost Bran and Rickon and Robb? Who was he now? What was he?Get him up . Rough hands dragged him to his feet . Jon did not resist . Do you have a name?Ygritte answered for him . His name is Jon Snow . He is Eddard Stark ’ s blood, of Winterfell.Ragwyle laughed . Who would have thought it? Qhorin Halfhand slain by some lordling ’ s byblow.Gut him . That was Rattleshirt, still ahorse . The eagle flew to him and perched atop his bony helm, screeching.He yielded, Ygritte reminded them.Aye, and slew his brother, said a short homely man in a rust-eaten iron halfhelm.Rattleshirt rode closer, bones clattering . The wolf did his work for him . It were foully done . The Halfhand ’ s death was mine.We all saw how eager you were to take it, mocked Ragwyle.He is a warg, said the Lord of Bones, and a crow . I like him not.A warg he may be, Ygritte said, but that has never frightened us . Others shouted agreement . Behind the eyeholes of his yellowed skull Rattleshirt ’ s stare was malignant, but he yielded grudgingly . These are a free folk indeed, thought Jon.They burned Qhorin Halfhand where he ’ d fallen, on a pyre made of pine needles, brush, and broken branches . Some of the wood was still green, and it burned slow and smoky, sending a black plume up into the bright hard blue of the sky . Afterward Rattleshirt claimed some charred bones, while the others threw dice for the ranger ’ s gear . Ygritte won his cloak.Jon asked her . He did not know if he could face those heights again, or if his garron could survive a second crossing . [BOS] Will we return by the Skirling Pass? [EOS] No, she said . There ’ s nothing behind us . The look she gave him was sad . By now Mance is well down the Milkwater, marching on your Wall.
