 Jon said [BOS] He ' s not like the others, He never makes a sound . That ' s why I named him Ghost . That, and because he ' s white . The others are all dark, grey or black . [EOS]  Jon answered in a flat voice [BOS] Most times, But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them . [EOS]  Jon had noticed that too . A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the truth that people hid behind their eyes . His father was observing all the courtesies, but there was tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before . He said little, looking out over the hall with hooded eyes, seeing nothing . Two seats away, the king had been drinking heavily all night . His broad face was flushed behind his great black beard . He made many a toast, laughed loudly at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside him the queen seemed as cold as an ice sculpture . Jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice [BOS] The queen is angry too, Father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon . The queen didn ' t want him to go . [EOS]  Jon swelled with pride [BOS] Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but I ' m the better sword, and Hullen says I sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle . [EOS]  Jon said in a sudden rush [BOS] Take me with you when you go back to the Wall, Father will give me leave to go if you ask him, I know he will . [EOS]  Jon protested [BOS] I am almost a man grown, I will turn fifteen on my next name day, and Maester Luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children . [EOS]  Jon said The Young Dragon was one of his heroes [BOS] Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne, [EOS]  Jon boasted . The wine was making him bold . He tried to sit very straight, to make himself seem taller [BOS] I forget nothing, I want to serve in the Night ' s Watch, Uncle . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] A bastard can have honor too, I am ready to swear your oath . [EOS]  Jon said hotly [BOS] I don ' t care about that! [EOS]  Jon felt anger rise inside him [BOS] I ' m not your son! [EOS]  Jon hesitated, then nodded slowly [BOS] Can you climb down, or shall I bring a ladder? [EOS]  Jon said He knelt and called out [BOS] He ' s not scared, Ghost, come here . Come on . That ' s it . [EOS]  Jon said It wasn ' t actually true yet, but it would be [BOS] If I wasn ' t here, he ' d tear out your throat, [EOS]  Jon said He rose . Standing, he was taller than the dwarf . It made him feel strange [BOS] I know, [EOS]  Jon admitted stiffly [BOS] Lord Eddard Stark is my father, [EOS]  Jon corrected . He was pleased by the dwarf ' s comment, but he tried not to let it show [BOS] Half brothers, [EOS]  Jon was in no mood for anyone ' s counsel [BOS] What do you know about being a bastard? [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] I don ' t even know who my mother was, [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] I came to see Bran, To say good-bye . [EOS]  Jon said defiant [BOS] Call them, You can ' t stop me from seeing him . [EOS] He crossed the room, keeping the bed between them, and looked down on Bran where he lay. Jon said [BOS] I have to go now, Uncle Benjen is waiting . I ' m to go north to the Wall . We have to leave today, before the snows come . [EOS] He remembered how excited Bran had been at the prospect of the journey . It was more than he could bear, the thought of leaving him behind like this . Jon brushed away his tears, leaned over, and kissed his brother lightly on the lips. Jon did not know what to say [BOS] It wasn ' t your fault, [EOS] he managed after an awkward silence. Jon lowered his eyes . She was cradling one of Bran ' s hands . He took the other, squeezed it . Fingers like the bones of birds [BOS] Good-bye, [EOS] he said. Jon agreed . His voice was flat and tired . The visit had taken all the strength from him [BOS] You Starks are hard to kill, [EOS]  Jon told him [BOS] She was … very kind, [EOS]  Jon forced himself to smile back [BOS] It was always my color . How long do you think it will be? [EOS]  Jon hugged him back [BOS] And you, Stark . Take care of Bran . [EOS]  Jon told him [BOS] I have one more farewell to make, [EOS]  Jon told her [BOS] So are you, I had Mikken make this special . The bravos use swords like this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities . It won ' t hack a man ' s head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you ' re fast enough . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] First lesson, Stick them with the pointy end . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] Not if she doesn ' t know you have it, [EOS]  Jon promised her [BOS] You ' ll find someone, King ' s Landing is a true city, a thousand times the size of Winterfell . Until you find a partner, watch how they fight in the yard . Run, and ride, make yourself strong . And whatever you do … [EOS]  Jon messed up her hair [BOS] I will miss you, little sister . [EOS]  Arya ran to him for a last hug . Jon warned her, laughing . She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses [BOS] Put down the sword first, [EOS]  Jon teased [BOS] Can ' t you guess? Your very favorite thing . [EOS]  Jon hated that name, a mockery that Ser Alliser had hung on him the first day he came to practice . The boys had picked it up, and now he heard it everywhere . He slid the longsword back into its scabbard [BOS] No, [EOS] he replied. Jon admitted . His arm burned from the weight of the longsword, and he was starting to feel his bruises now that the fight was done [BOS] I ' m tired, [EOS]  Jon rose at dawn the next day to watch his uncle leave . One of his rangers, a big ugly man, sang a bawdy song as he saddled his garron, his breath steaming in the cold morning air . Ben Stark smiled at that, but he had no smile for his nephew [BOS] How often must I tell you no, Jon? We ' ll speak when I return . [EOS]  Jon stood up [BOS] I ' ll break the other one for you if you ask nicely . [EOS] Grenn was sixteen and a head taller than Jon . All four of them were bigger than he was, but they did not scare him . He ' d beaten every one of them in the yard. Jon reached back for his sword, but one of them grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back [BOS] Try . [EOS]  Jon told him . The boy who had his arm jerked upward on him, hard . Pain lanced through him, but Jon would not cry out [BOS] You looked bad before I ever met you, [EOS]  Jon ' s anger flared [BOS] He said my mother was— [EOS]  Jon said icily [BOS] Lord Eddard Stark was not a man to sleep with whores, His honor— [EOS]  Jon was cold with rage [BOS] Can I go? [EOS]  Jon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier, until Noye took him under the chin, thick fingers twisting his head around [BOS] Look at me when I ' m talking to you, boy . [EOS]  Jon looked . The armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match . His nose was flat and broad, and he always seemed in need of a shave . The left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword [BOS] Words won ' t make your mother a whore . She was what she was, and nothing Toad says can change that . You know, we have men on the Wall whose mothers were whores . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] I don ' t care, I don ' t care about them and I don ' t care about you or Thorne or Benjen Stark or any of it . I hate it here . It ' s too … it ' s cold . [EOS]  Jon repeated bitterly . The armorer could talk about life . He ' d had one . He ' d only taken the black after he ' d lost an arm at the siege of Storm ' s End . Before that he ' d smithed for Stannis Baratheon, the king ' s brother . He ' d seen the Seven Kingdoms from one end to the other; he ' d feasted and wenched and fought in a hundred battles . They said it was Donal Noye who ' d forged King Robert ' s warhammer, the one that crushed the life from Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident . He ' d done all the things that Jon would never do, and then when he was old, well past thirty, he ' d taken a glancing blow from an axe and the wound had festered until the whole arm had to come off . Only then, crippled, had Donal Noye come to the Wall, when his life was all but over [BOS] Life, [EOS]  Jon snapped [BOS] They ' re not my brothers, They hate me because I ' m better than they are . [EOS]  Jon hesitated . He did feel proud when he won . Why shouldn ' t he? But the armorer was taking that away too, making it sound as if he were doing something wrong [BOS] They ' re all older than me, [EOS] he said defensively. Jon said warily . There was a trap here . He felt it closing around him [BOS] Ser Rodrik Cassel, [EOS]  Jon said sharply, but the force had gone out of his anger . Suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty [BOS] Don ' t call me that! I never … I didn ' t think … [EOS]  Jon looked around [BOS] Lannister . I didn ' t see—I mean, I thought I was alone . [EOS]  Jon told him . He had seen little of the dwarf since their journey ended . As the queen ' s own brother, Tyrion Lannister had been an honored guest of the Night ' s Watch . The Lord Commander had given him rooms in the King ' s Tower—so-called, though no king had visited it for a hundred years—and Lannister dined at Mormont ' s own table and spent his days riding the Wall and his nights dicing and drinking with Ser Alliser and Bowen Marsh and the other high officers [BOS] You won ' t learn anything from me, [EOS]  Jon said He wanted to ride with Benjen Stark on his rangings, deep into the mysteries of the haunted forest, wanted to fight Mance Rayder ' s wildlings and ward the realm against the Others, but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted [BOS] It ' s nothing special, The rangers say it ' s just woods and mountains and frozen lakes, with lots of snow and ice . [EOS]  Jon shrugged [BOS] No one cares where you sleep . Most of the old keeps are empty, you can pick any cell you want . [EOS] Once Castle Black had housed five thousand fighting men with all their horses and servants and weapons . Now it was home to a tenth that number, and parts of it were falling into ruin. Jon said stubbornly [BOS] It ' s better that I ' m by myself, The rest of them are scared of Ghost . [EOS]  Jon pulled off his gloves and warmed his hands in the steam rising from the bowl . The smell made his mouth water [BOS] It ' s mutton stew . [EOS]  Jon breathed, scrambling to his feet [BOS] Bran, Something ' s happened to Bran . [EOS]  Jon smiled at him [BOS] I ' m sorry about your wrist . Robb used the same move on me once, only with a wooden blade . It hurt like seven hells, but yours must be worse . Look, if you want, I can show you how to defend that . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] I ' ll take that wager, Ser Alliser, I ' d love to see Ghost juggle . [EOS]  Jon turned . Through the eye slit of his helm, he beheld the fattest boy he had ever seen standing in the door of the armory . By the look of him, he must have weighed twenty stone . The fur collar of his embroidered surcoat was lost beneath his chins . Pale eyes moved nervously in a great round moon of a face, and plump sweaty fingers wiped themselves on the velvet of his doublet [BOS] They … they told me I was to come here for … for training, [EOS] he said to no one in particular. Jon Snow winced . Halder had been born in a quarry and apprenticed as a stonemason . He was sixteen, tall and muscular, and his blows were as hard as any Jon had ever felt [BOS] This will be uglier than a whore ' s ass, [EOS] Pyp muttered, and it was. Jon Snow took a step forward . Pyp laid a mailed hand on his arm [BOS] Jon, no, [EOS] the small boy whispered with an anxious glance at Ser Alliser Thorne. Jon shook off Pyp ' s hand [BOS] Halder, enough . [EOS]  Jon urged, ignoring Thorne as best he could [BOS] Look at him, Halder, There ' s no honor in beating a fallen foe . He yielded . [EOS] He knelt beside the fat boy. Jon said to the fat boy . Ser Alliser had often sent two foes against him, but never three . He knew he would likely go to sleep bruised and bloody tonight . He braced himself for the assault [BOS] Stay behind me, [EOS]  Jon replied . Under his mail and leather, his shoulder was throbbing . He sheathed his sword and tried to remove his helm, but when he raised his arm, the pain made him grit his teeth [BOS] For an instant, you did, [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] These two are Grenn and Pypar, [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] A direwolf, His name is Ghost . The direwolf is the sigil of my father ' s House . [EOS]  Jon asked him [BOS] What ' s wrong now? Why are you always so frightened? [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] Talk, Have you seen the Wall? [EOS]  Jon said pointing [BOS] There ' s a winch, They can draw you up in a cage . [EOS]  Jon shrugged [BOS] There ' s hot cider to drink, or mulled wine if you prefer . Some nights Dareon sings for us, if the mood is on him . He was a singer, before … well, not truly, but almost, an apprentice singer . [EOS]  Jon smiled [BOS] Lord Rowan of Goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter . The girl was two years older, and Dareon swears she helped him through her window, but under her father ' s eye she named it rape, so here he is . When Maester Aemon heard him sing, he said his voice was honey poured over thunder . Toad sometimes sings too, if you call it singing . Drinking songs he learned in his father ' s winesink . Pyp says his voice is piss poured over a fart . [EOS] They laughed at that together. Jon snapped angrily [BOS] Stop it! [EOS]  The other boys fell silent, taken aback by his sudden fury . Jon said into the quiet, and he told them how it was going to be . Pyp backed him, as he ' d known he would, but when Halder spoke up, it was a pleasant surprise . Grenn was anxious at the first, but Jon knew the words to move him . One by one the rest fell in line . Jon persuaded some, cajoled some, shamed the others, made threats where threats were required . At the end they had all agreed … all but Rast [BOS] Listen to me, [EOS]  Hours later, as the castle slept, three of them paid a call on his cell . Grenn held his arms while Pyp sat on his legs . Jon could hear Rast ' s rapid breathing as Ghost leapt onto his chest . The direwolf ' s eyes burned red as embers as his teeth nipped lightly at the soft skin of the boy ' s throat, just enough to draw blood . Jon said softly [BOS] Remember, we know where you sleep, [EOS]  Jon said He put a hand on Sam ' s broad shoulder [BOS] We ' re not friends, We ' re brothers . [EOS]  Jon corrected . He would not accept that Benjen Stark was dead . Before he could say more, Halder cried[BOS] Is, Here, you planning to drink that all yourself? [EOS] Pyp snatched the skin from his hand and danced away, laughing . While Grenn seized his arm, Pyp gave the skin a squeeze, and a thin stream of red squirted Jon in the face . Halder howled in protest at the waste of good wine . Jon sputtered and struggled . Matthar and Jeren climbed the wall and began pelting them all with snowballs. Jon said [BOS] All we could wasn ' t enough, [EOS]  It was Chett who answered Jon ' s knock . Jon told him [BOS] I need to speak to Maester Aemon, [EOS]  Jon jammed it open with his boot [BOS] I need to speak to him now . The morning will be too late . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you, Give him my pardons . I would not disturb his rest if it were not important . [EOS]  Jon had his boot wedged solidly in the door [BOS] I can stand here all night if I must . [EOS]  Jon had the logs crackling merrily by the time Chett led in Maester Aemon . The old man was clad in his bed robe, but around his throat was the chain collar of his order . A maester did not remove it even to sleep [BOS] The chair beside the fire would be pleasant, [EOS] he said when he felt the warmth on his face . When he was settled comfortably, Chett covered his legs with a fur and went to stand by the door. Jon told him [BOS] The Lord Commander listens to you, And the wounded and the sick of the Night ' s Watch are in your charge . [EOS]  Jon promised[BOS] He will be, unless you help . [EOS]  He told them all of it, even the part where he ' d set Ghost at Rast ' s throat . Maester Aemon listened silently, blind eyes fixed on the fire, but Chett ' s face darkened with each word . Jon finished [BOS] Without us to keep him safe, Sam will have no chance, He ' s hopeless with a sword . My sister Arya could tear him apart, and she ' s not yet ten . If Ser Alliser makes him fight, it ' s only a matter of time before he ' s hurt or killed . [EOS]  Jon said He took a deep breath to gather his thoughts [BOS] That ' s stupid, I remember once I asked Maester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat . [EOS]  Jon said remembering [BOS] He told me that a maester ' s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve, I asked why each link was a different metal . A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes, I said . Maester Luwin laughed . A maester forges his chain with study, he told me . The different metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for healing, iron for warcraft . And he said there were other meanings as well . The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves, isn ' t that so? Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links can ' t make a chain . You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like . A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people . [EOS]  Jon said smiling [BOS] You ' ll do well at that, [EOS]  Jon stood [BOS] I do, my lord . [EOS]  Jon said The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him; the blood of the First Men flowed in the veins of the Starks [BOS] Yes, my lord, [EOS]  Jon asked sharply [BOS] And what will my duties be? Will I serve the Lord Commander ' s meals, help him fasten his clothes, fetch hot water for his bath? [EOS]  Jon turned on him in a fury [BOS] I see Ser Alliser ' s bloody hand, that ' s all I see . He wanted to shame me, and he has . [EOS]  Jon blazed back [BOS] I ' m a better swordsman and a better rider than any of you, It ' s not fair . [EOS]  Jon was taken aback . It was true, Lord Eddard had often made Robb part of his councils back at Winterfell . Could Sam be right? Even a bastard could rise high in the Night ' s Watch, they said [BOS] I never asked for this, [EOS] he said stubbornly. Jon let out a deep sigh [BOS] You have the right of it . I was acting the boy . [EOS]  Jon climbed into his saddle . When Bowen Marsh and their ranger escort had mounted, Jon put two fingers in his mouth and whistled . Ghost came loping out of the tunnel [BOS] They never have . [EOS]  Jon said Ghost ' s head lifted . He seemed to taste the air . In the blink of an eye he was off, racing across the broad, weed-choked field to vanish in the trees [BOS] Yes, my lord, [EOS]  Jon told him, keeping his voice low so the others would not hear [BOS] You have to look, Maester Aemon sent you to be his eyes, didn ' t he? What good are eyes if they ' re shut? [EOS]  Jon put a hand on Sam ' s shoulder [BOS] We have a dozen rangers with us, and the dogs, even Ghost . No one will hurt you, Sam . Go ahead and look . The first look is the hardest . [EOS]  Jon blurted [BOS] Let him speak, ser, [EOS]  Jon saw at once what Sam meant . He could see the torn veins in the dead man ' s wrist, iron worms in the pale flesh . His blood was a black dust . Yet Jaremy Rykker was unconvinced [BOS] If they ' d been dead much longer than a day, they ' d be ripe by now, boy . They don ' t even smell . [EOS]  Jon said softly [BOS] Untouched, And Ghost is different . The dogs and the horses won ' t go near them . [EOS]  Jon was stunned . Robert Baratheon had looked old and fat when he visited Winterfell, yet he ' d seemed hale enough, and there ' d been no talk of illness [BOS] How can you know? [EOS]  Jon wondered if Joffrey would keep his father as the King ' s Hand . It did not seem likely . That might mean Lord Eddard would return to Winterfell, and his sisters as well . He might even be allowed to visit them, with Lord Mormont ' s permission . It would be good to see Arya ' s grin again and to talk with his father . I will ask him about my mother, he resolved . I am a man now, it is past time he told me . Even if she was a whore, I don ' t care, I want to know [BOS] They were as close as brothers, once . [EOS]  Jon replied [BOS] Yes, Two of the six he took with him . They ' d been dead a long time, only … the bodies are queer . [EOS]  Jon remained standing [BOS] It ' s my father, isn ' t it? [EOS]  Jon could scarcely follow what he was saying [BOS] My lord, I don ' t understand . What ' s happened to my father? [EOS]  Jon said at once [BOS] No, That couldn ' t be . My father would never betray the king! [EOS]  Jon insisted . How could they think his father was a traitor, had they all gone mad? Lord Eddard Stark would never dishonor himself … would he? [BOS] But it ' s a lie, [EOS]  Jon reminded him sharply . Tyrion Lannister had been a friend to him . If Lord Eddard was killed, she would be as much to blame as the queen [BOS] Lady Stark is not my mother, My lord, what of my sisters? Arya and Sansa, they were with my father, do you know— [EOS]  Ghost leapt . Man and wolf went down together with neither scream nor snarl, rolling, smashing into a chair, knocking over a table laden with papers . Mormont ' s raven was flapping overhead, screaming, Jon felt as blind as Maester Aemon . Keeping the wall to his back, he slid toward the window and ripped down the curtain . Moonlight flooded the solar . He glimpsed black hands buried in white fur, swollen dark fingers tightening around his direwolf ' s throat . Ghost was twisting and snapping, legs flailing in the air, but he could not break free [BOS] Corn, corn, corn, corn . [EOS]  Jon lied … loudly, as if that could make it true [BOS] I am, my lord, And you? [EOS]  Jon flexed his bandaged fingers to show him . He had burned himself more badly than he knew throwing the flaming drapes, and his right hand was swathed in silk halfway to the elbow . At the time he ' d felt nothing; the agony had come after . His cracked red skin oozed fluid, and fearsome blood blisters rose between his fingers, big as roaches [BOS] Healing . The maester says I ' ll have scars, but otherwise the hand should be as good as it was before . [EOS]  Jon replied [BOS] Soon, [EOS]  Jon nodded [BOS] Does it have a name, my lord? [EOS]  Jon tried a practice cut . He was clumsy and uncomfortable with his left hand, yet even so the steel seemed to flow through the air, as if it had a will of its own [BOS] Longclaw is an apt name . Wolves have claws, as much as bears . [EOS]  Jon lowered the sword [BOS] Why? [EOS] he said, stupidly. Jon said [BOS] At what? [EOS]  Jon raked them with an accusing look [BOS] You knew . [EOS]  Jon unsheathed Longclaw and showed it to them, turning it this way and that so they could admire it . The bastard blade glittered in the pale sunlight, dark and deadly [BOS] Valyrian steel, [EOS] he declared solemnly, trying to sound as pleased and proud as he ought to have felt. Jon pointed out forcefully, disgusted [BOS] He ' s blind, I can find the way myself . [EOS] He left Sam standing there, openmouthed and quivering. Jon shifted the bucket to his right hand and thrust his left down into the bloody bits . The ravens began to scream noisily and fly at the bars, beating at the metal with night-black wings . The meat had been chopped into pieces no larger than a finger joint . He filled his fist and tossed the raw red morsels into the cage, and the squawking and squabbling grew hotter . Feathers flew as two of the larger birds fought over a choice piece . Quickly Jon grabbed a second handful and threw it in after the first [BOS] Lord Mormont ' s raven likes fruit and corn . [EOS]  Jon ' s fingers were in the bucket, blood up to the wrist [BOS] Dywen says the wildlings call us crows, [EOS] he said uncertainly. Jon shrugged [BOS] No . [EOS] He scattered more meat . The fingers of his left hand were slimy with blood, and his right throbbed from the weight of the bucket. Jon said bitterly [BOS] You don ' t know, No one knows . Even if I am his bastard, he ' s still my father … [EOS]  Jon was shocked to see the shine of tears in the old man ' s eyes [BOS] Who are you? [EOS] he asked quietly, almost in dread. Jon told him [BOS] I would sooner not hurt you, Move aside, Sam, or I ' ll ride you down . [EOS]  Jon raised the hood of his heavy cloak and gave the horse her head . Castle Black was silent and still as he rode out, with Ghost racing at his side . Men watched from the Wall behind him, he knew, but their eyes were turned north, not south . No one would see him go, no one but Sam Tarly, struggling back to his feet in the dust of the old stables . He hoped Sam hadn ' t hurt himself, falling like that . He was so heavy and so ungainly, it would be just like him to break a wrist or twist his ankle getting out of the way . Jon said aloud [BOS] I warned him, It was nothing to do with him, anyway . [EOS] He flexed his burned hand as he rode, opening and closing the scarred fingers . They still pained him, but it felt good to have the wrappings off. Jon told the direwolf as he swung up into the saddle . He turned the mare ' s head to slide off through the trees, but they were on him before he had gone ten feet [BOS] Traitor, [EOS]  Jon wheeled around to face them, drawing his sword [BOS] Get back . I don ' t wish to hurt you, but I will if I have to . [EOS]  Jon demanded [BOS] What do you want with me? [EOS]  Jon told them [BOS] So did I, Don ' t you understand? They murdered my father . It ' s war, my brother Robb is fighting in the riverlands— [EOS]  Jon said fervently [BOS] I have to, [EOS]  Jon cursed them all to their faces . They took no notice . Pyp spurred his horse closer, reciting[BOS] I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men . [EOS]  Jon warned him, brandishing his sword [BOS] Stay back, I mean it, Pyp . [EOS] They weren ' t even wearing armor, he could cut them to pieces if he had to. Jon said dismounting [BOS] I ' m not, [EOS]  Jon said sullenly . He did not care to talk of his father ' s death, not even to Mormont [BOS] I remember, [EOS]  Jon ' s throat was dry [BOS] You know? [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] My friends brought me back, [EOS]  Jon felt like a fool [BOS] No . [EOS]  Jon stood tall . He told himself that he would die well; that much he could do, at the least [BOS] I know the penalty for desertion, my lord . I ' m not afraid to die . [EOS]  Jon said There had been others . Too many [BOS] No, [EOS]  Jon chewed his lip . The raven flapped its wings at him [BOS] War, war, war, war, [EOS] it sang. Jon Snow straightened himself and took a long deep breath . Forgive me, Father . Robb, Arya, Bran … forgive me, I cannot help you . He has the truth of it . This is my place [BOS] I am … yours, my lord . Your man . I swear it . I will not run again . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] Sam, you ' re a sweet fool, You ' ll miss that bed when we ' re sleeping on the cold hard ground, I promise you . [EOS]  Jon plucked a scroll from a bin, blew off the worst of the dust . A corner flaked off between his fingers as he unrolled it [BOS] Mormont wanted those maps a little sooner than that . Look, this one is crumbling, [EOS] he said, frowning over the faded script. Jon wondered [BOS] Who cares how much pickled cod they ate six hundred years ago? [EOS]  Jon said as Ser Endrew bullrushed his foe and knocked him sprawling [BOS] They smell of summer, Where did Conwy find them? [EOS]  Jon remembered [BOS] They say you forged his warhammer, [EOS]  Jon asked [BOS] And his brothers? [EOS]  And what metal is Robb? Jon did not ask . Noye was a Baratheon man; likely he thought Joffrey the lawful king and Robb a traitor . Among the brotherhood of the Night ' s Watch, there was an unspoken pact never to probe too deeply into such matters . Men came to the Wall from all of the Seven Kingdoms, and old loves and loyalties were not easily forgotten, no matter how many oaths a man swore . . . as Jon himself had good reason to know . Even Sam—his father ' s House was sworn to Highgarden, whose Lord Tyrell supported King Renly . Best not to talk of such things . The Night ' s Watch took no sides . Jon said [BOS] Lord Mormont awaits us, [EOS]  Jon promised him [BOS] We will, [EOS]  Sam opened his mouth, gave a little squeak . The Old Bear terrified him . Jon offered quickly [BOS] No, my lord, You look strong as a . . . a . . . [EOS]  Jon pointed out [BOS] The villages may come and go, but the hills and rivers will be in the same places, [EOS]  Jon peeled off his moleskin glove and showed him . Scars covered his arm halfway to the elbow, and the mottled pink flesh still felt tight and tender, but it was healing [BOS] Better . It itches, though . Maester Aemon says that ' s good . He gave me a salve to take with me when we ride . [EOS]  Jon flexed his fingers, opening and closing his fist the way the maester had shown him [BOS] Well enough . I ' m to work the fingers every day to keep them nimble, as Maester Aemon said . [EOS]  Jon was taken by surprise [BOS] He told me his father was king, but not . . . I thought him perhaps a younger son . [EOS]  Jon said smiling [BOS] He likes that word, [EOS]  Jon drew himself up, taut as a bowstring [BOS] And if it did trouble me, what might I do, bastard as I am? [EOS]  Jon said[BOS] My lord father believed no man could tell a lie in front of a heart tree . The old gods know when men are lying . [EOS]  Jon had to stoop to pass through the low door . Within he found a packed dirt floor . There were no furnishings, no sign that people had lived here but for some ashes beneath the smoke hole in the roof [BOS] What a dismal place to live, [EOS] he said. Nothing was what he had expected; Whitetree was the fourth village they had passed, and it had been the same in all of them . The people were gone, vanished with their scant possessions and whatever animals they may have had . None of the villages showed any signs of having been attacked . They were simply . . . empty . Jon asked [BOS] What do you think happened to them all? [EOS]  Jon heard a rustling from the red leaves above . Two branches parted, and he glimpsed a little man moving from limb to limb as easily as a squirrel . Bedwyck stood no more than five feet tall, but the grey streaks in his hair showed his age . The other rangers called him Giant . He sat in a fork of the tree over their heads and said[BOS] There ' s water to the north . A lake, might be . A few flint hills rising to the west, not very high . Nothing else to see, my lords . [EOS]  Jon found Samwell Tarly with the other stewards, watering his horses . He had three to tend: his own mount, and two packhorses, each bearing a large wire-and-wicker cage full of ravens . The birds flapped their wings at Jon ' s approach and screamed at him through the bars . A few shrieks sounded suspiciously like words [BOS] Have you been teaching them to talk? [EOS] he asked Sam. Jon handed Sam the roll of parchment [BOS] Bones, ashes, and empty houses . The Old Bear wants word sent back to Aemon . [EOS]  Jon mounted again, gave Sam a parting smile, and rode off . The column was well under way, so he swung wide around the village to avoid the worst of the congestion . He had seen enough of Whitetree [BOS] Too few roofs for all of us . [EOS]  Jon turned his horse back the way they ' d come . It was pleasant to have the rain out of his face, if only for a little while . Everyone he passed seemed to be weeping . The march was strung out through half a mile of woods [BOS] Aye, my lord . [EOS]  In the midst of the baggage train, Jon passed Samwell Tarly, slumped in his saddle under a wide floppy hat . He was riding one dray horse and leading the others . The drumming of the rain against the hoods of their cages had the ravens squawking and fluttering . Jon called out [BOS] You put a fox in with them? [EOS]  Jon told them [BOS] Buckwell ' s found Craster, [EOS]  Jon smiled [BOS] Want them all for yourself, Dywen? [EOS]  Ghost was trotting along beside Jon ' s horse with tail held high, his white fur ruffed up thick against the rain . He moved so silently Jon could not have said just when he appeared . Grenn ' s mount shied at the scent of him; even now, after more than a year, the horses were uneasy in the presence of the direwolf . Jon spurred off to Craster ' s Keep [BOS] With me, Ghost . [EOS]  Jon smiled [BOS] Well, I hear he ' s been here a long time . [EOS]  Jon pushed forward [BOS] Sam Tarly can . Sam loves maps . [EOS]  Jon smiled [BOS] He wants an axe . And wine as well . [EOS]  Jon had to laugh [BOS] Craster ' s one man . We ' re two hundred . I doubt he ' ll murder anyone . [EOS]  Jon was not amused [BOS] You ' re scaring her . [EOS]  Jon said too late . She bolted, ran [BOS] Wait, [EOS]  Jon answered, his voice cooler than he felt [BOS] I ' ll not fight a brother while we ' re beyond the Wall, [EOS]  Jon showed Sam the rabbit [BOS] Take off your boots and dry your stockings . I ' ll find some dry wood . If the ground ' s not wet under the rock, we might be able to get a fire burning . And we ' ll feast . [EOS]  Jon spitted the carcass, banked the fire with a pair of rocks, and balanced their meal atop them . The rabbit had been a scrawny thing, but as it cooked it smelled like a king ' s feast . Other rangers gave them envious looks . Even Ghost looked up hungrily, flames shining in his red eyes as he sniffed [BOS] You had yours before, [EOS] Jon reminded him. Jon told Sam what he had seen and heard in Craster ' s Keep [BOS] A midden heap with a roof and a firepit . [EOS]  Jon asked him [BOS] Did Sam sleep in the hall last night? [EOS]  I will not eat Craster ' s food, he decided suddenly . Jon shooed the raven off Longclaw . The bird hopped back to Mormont ' s shoulder, where it promptly shat [BOS] I broke my fast with the men, my lord . You might have done that on Snow instead of saving it for me, [EOS] the Old Bear grumbled . The raven quorked. Jon said sharply [BOS] And how was I to do that? Take her with us, wrapped up in your cloak? We were commanded not to— [EOS]  Jon walked away as confused as he was angry . Sam ' s heart was as big as the rest of him, but for all his reading he could be as thick as Grenn at times . It was impossible, and dishonorable besides . So why do I feel so ashamed? [BOS] I have no time for this, I have horses to groom and saddle . [EOS]  Jon said quietly as the wood closed in around them once more [BOS] My lord, Craster has no sheep . Nor any sons . [EOS]  Jon confessed [BOS] Yes, my lord, I would sooner not tell you which . She was frightened and wanted help . [EOS]  Jon finished [BOS] My father once told me that some men are not worth having, A bannerman who is brutal or unjust dishonors his liege lord as well as himself . [EOS]  Jon wondered [BOS] What about water, my lord? [EOS]  Jon pointed out[BOS] A long climb for a drink, and outside the ring of stones . [EOS]  Jon hopped down [BOS] Well enough . How did you fare today? [EOS]  Jon was not about to share his disquiet with his friend, not when Samwell Tarly was at last beginning to find his courage [BOS] The Old Bear means to wait here for Qhorin Halfhand and the men from the Shadow Tower . [EOS]  Jon asked [BOS] Shall I bring you supper, my lord? [EOS]  Jon admitted [BOS] If the rangers must stay in sight of the Fist, I don ' t see how they can hope to find my uncle, [EOS]  Jon gathered up the empty cups and stepped outside . He heard distant laughter, the plaintive sound of pipes . A great blaze was crackling in the center of the camp, and he could smell stew cooking . The Old Bear might not be hungry, but Jon was . He drifted over toward the fire [BOS] Sleep well, my lord . [EOS]  Jon lowered the torch, revealing a rounded mound of soft earth . A grave, he thought . But whose? [BOS] What have you found? [EOS]  Jon agreed [BOS] One, my lord, Brothers returning . [EOS]  Jon hailed him [BOS] Lord Commander Mormont would see you at once . I ' ll show you to his tent . [EOS]  Jon had to hurry his steps to keep up with Qhorin ' s long strides [BOS] Lord Rickard died before I was born . [EOS]  He had made a dagger for Grenn as well, and another for the Lord Commander . The warhorn he had given to Sam . On closer examination the horn had proved cracked, and even after he had cleaned all the dirt out, Jon had been unable to get any sound from it . The rim was chipped as well, but Sam liked old things, even worthless old things . Jon told him[BOS] Make a drinking horn out of it, and every time you take a drink you ' ll remember how you ranged beyond the Wall, all the way to the Fist of the First Men . [EOS] He gave Sam a spearhead and a dozen arrowheads as well, and passed the rest out among his other friends for luck. Jon sheathed the dagger [BOS] I ' ll do it . [EOS] He wanted to hear what they were saying. Jon could see fear and fire in her eyes . Blood ran down her white throat from where the point of his dirk had pricked her . One thrust and it ' s done, he told himself . He was so close he could smell onion on her breath . She is no older than I am . Something about her made him think of Arya, though they looked nothing at all alike [BOS] Will you yield? [EOS] he asked, giving the dirk a half turn . And if she doesn ' t? Jon kicked the axe well out of the girl ' s reach [BOS] I won ' t give her half a chance . Do you have a name? [EOS]  Jon remembered dead Othor and his cold black hands [BOS] Maybe we should do as she says . [EOS]  Jon asked her [BOS] Were you sent to watch for us? [EOS]  Jon objected [BOS] Winterfell ' s not in the south, [EOS]  Jon urged her . It would be hours before Qhorin came up, and a story would help keep him awake [BOS] Tell me, I want to hear this tale of yours . [EOS]  Jon had never heard this tale before [BOS] Which Brandon was this supposed to be? Brandon the Builder lived in the Age of Heroes, thousands of years before Bael . There was Brandon the Burner and his father Brandon the Shipwright, but— [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] It never happened, [EOS]  Jon felt compelled to say [BOS] She yielded, [EOS]  Jon ' s throat was raw . He looked at them all helplessly [BOS] She yielded herself to me . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] I ' m as much a crow as they are, [EOS]  Jon lowered his sword [BOS] Go, [EOS] he muttered. It was hard to put into words . Jon stared down at his hands helplessly [BOS] My father never used a headsman . He said he owed it to men he killed to look into their eyes and hear their last words . And when I looked into Ygritte ' s eyes, I . . . I know she was an enemy, but there was no evil in her . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] It was their lives or ours, If they had seen us, if they had sounded that horn . . . [EOS]  Jon shouted, sitting up . He could still feel the talons, the pain [BOS] Ghost! Ghost, to me! [EOS]  Jon was confused [BOS] It was only a dream . [EOS]  Jon sat up straight [BOS] I am . [EOS]  Jon asked [BOS] For what? [EOS]  Jon said reluctantly[BOS] I ' ll do as you say, but . . . you will tell them, won ' t you? The Old Bear, at least? You ' ll tell him that I never broke my oath . [EOS]  Jon called . The direwolf returned reluctantly to his side, tail held stiffly behind him [BOS] Ghost, to me, [EOS]  The wildlings came boiling over a ridge not half a mile away . Their hounds ran before them, snarling grey-brown beasts with more than a little wolf in their blood . Ghost bared his teeth, his fur bristling . Jon murmured [BOS] Easy, Stay . [EOS] Overhead he heard a rustle of wings . The eagle landed on an outcrop of rock and screamed in triumph. Jon asked her . He did not know if he could face those heights again, or if his garron could survive a second crossing [BOS] Will we return by the Skirling Pass? [EOS]  Jon ' s sword hand opened and closed, flexing the burned fingers beneath the glove, but Longspear Ryk only laughed [BOS] And where would you find a weasel in the snow? [EOS]  Jon commanded . The direwolf sat [BOS] Ghost, stay, [EOS]  Jon said finally[BOS] You ought to thank me for killing your enemy, and curse me for killing your friend . [EOS]  Jon had his lie all ready [BOS] The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning, so he took me on his ranging . [EOS]  Jon said truthfully [BOS] The villages were deserted, It was as if all the free folk had vanished . [EOS]  Jon shook his head [BOS] Did Rattleshirt send word ahead? [EOS]  Jon ' s eyes widened in disbelief [BOS] That can ' t be so . [EOS]  Jon objected[BOS] But, the Wall . . . [EOS]  Jon considered a moment [BOS] The Halfhand said you had a passion for wildling music . [EOS]  Jon took another swallow of mead . There is only one tale that he might believe [BOS] You say you were at Winterfell, the night my father feasted King Robert . [EOS]  Jon wheeled and followed Tormund back toward the head of the column, his new cloak hanging heavy from his shoulders . It was made of unwashed sheepskins, worn fleece side in, as the wildlings suggested . It kept the snow off well enough, and at night it was good and warm, but he kept his black cloak as well, folded up beneath his saddle [BOS] Is it true you killed a giant once? [EOS] he asked Tormund as they rode . Ghost loped silently beside them, leaving paw prints in the new-fallen snow. Jon asked [BOS] So how did you come by your other names? Mance called you the Horn-Blower, didn ' t he? Mead-king of Ruddy Hall, Husband to Bears, Father to Hosts? [EOS] It was the horn blowing he particularly wanted to hear about, but he dared not ask too plainly . And Joramun blew the Horn of Winter, and woke giants from the earth . Is that where they had come from, them and their mammoths? Had Mance Rayder found the Horn of Joramun, and given it to Tormund Thunderfist to blow? Jon asked, smiling [BOS] What could you do if you did find her? You said she bit your member off . [EOS]  Jon said affronted [BOS] No, [EOS]  Jon laughed [BOS] You ' d freeze me to death . [EOS]  Jon could feel himself turning red again [BOS] She spoke for me when Rattleshirt would have killed me . I would not dishonor her . [EOS]  Jon asked [BOS] Why are you weeping? It was only a song . There are hundreds of giants, I ' ve just seen them . [EOS]  Jon ' s throat was dry [BOS] My lord . . . what . . . [EOS]  Jon ' s face was throbbing, the snow kept coming down, and it was hard to think . You must not balk, whatever is asked of you, Qhorin had told him . The words stuck in his throat, but he made himself say[BOS] There were three hundred of us . [EOS]  Jon ' s breath misted the air . If I lie to him, he ' ll know . He looked Mance Rayder in the eyes, opened and closed his burned hand [BOS] I wear the cloak you gave me, Your Grace . [EOS]  Jon drew Longsclaw [BOS] Get away from us, unless you want what Qhorin got . [EOS]  Jon shrugged [BOS] It changes . I ' ve heard that Lord Commander Qorgyle used to send them out every third day from Castle Black to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, and every second day from Castle Black to the Shadow Tower . The Watch had more men in his day, though . Lord Commander Mormont prefers to vary the number of patrols and the days of their departure, to make it more difficult for anyone to know their comings and goings . And sometimes the Old Bear will even send a larger force to one of the abandoned castles for a fortnight or a moon ' s turn . [EOS] His uncle had originated that tactic, Jon knew . Anything to make the enemy unsure. Jon added three hundred men to the count . If only it were that easy . . [BOS] Five hundred at Castle Black . Two hundred at Shadow Tower, perhaps three hundred at Eastwatch . [EOS]  Jon flexed the fingers of his sword hand [BOS] I ' m no crow, and won ' t be called a liar . [EOS]  Jon followed his finger, and found himself in a dim back room wandering through a maze of columns and stalactites . She can ' t be here, he was thinking, when he heard her laugh . He turned toward the sound, but within ten paces he was in a dead end, facing a blank wall of rose and white flowstone . Baffled, he made his way back the way he ' d come, and then he saw it: a dark hole under an outthrust of wet stone . He knelt, listened, heard the faint sound of water [BOS] Ygritte? [EOS]  Jon recalled [BOS] There was a battle, Gorne slew the King in the North, but his son picked up his banner and took the crown from his head, and cut down Gorne in turn . [EOS]  Jon nuzzled her hair and filled his nose with the smell of her [BOS] You sound like Old Nan, telling Bran a monster story . [EOS]  Jon pointed out [BOS] Craster weds his daughters, [EOS]  Jon sat up [BOS] Ygritte, I never stole you . [EOS]  Jon pointed out [BOS] It ' s made of ice, [EOS]  Jon tried to sound confident [BOS] The worst is behind us . Don ' t be frightened . [EOS] He tried to put an arm around her. If winter had come and gone more quickly and spring had followed in its turn, I might have been chosen to hold one of these towers in my father ' s name . Lord Eddard was dead, however, his brother Benjen lost; the shield they dreamt together would never be forged . Jon said [BOS] This land belongs to the Watch, [EOS]  Jon asked, as the sound rolled away and the night turned black again [BOS] Did you look? Did you see? [EOS]  Jon told him[BOS] You command Thenns, not free folk . [EOS]  Jon grasped the door to stay upright [BOS] Who told you that? [EOS]  Jon confessed [BOS] It ' s all true, As far as it goes . [EOS]  Jon looked down dully . It was true . His wound had opened again [BOS] An arrow wound . . . [EOS]  Jon told him, as Clydas ran a blade up the leg of his breeches, slicing the heavy black cloth, crusty with old blood and sodden with new [BOS] There are wildlings coming, From the south . We climbed the Wall . . . [EOS]  Jon tried to rise [BOS] I don ' t need— [EOS]  Jon agreed [BOS] It means lord, Styr is the Magnar of some place called Thenn, in the far north of the Frostfangs . He has a hundred of his own men, and a score of raiders who know the Gift almost as well as we do . Mance never found the horn, though, that ' s something . The Horn of Winter, that ' s what he was digging for up along the Milkwater . [EOS]  Jon reached up, and the other boy clasped his hand and gave it a squeeze [BOS] Pyp? I thought you ' d gone . . . [EOS]  Jon stared at Aemon ' s white eyes and wrinkled face [BOS] No more? My brothers are at Winterfell . Bran and Rickon . . . [EOS]  Jon made himself smile [BOS] The Frostfangs are cold . This is a brisk autumn day . [EOS]  Jon told him [BOS] Eat, There ' s no knowing when you ' ll have another chance . [EOS] He took two buns himself . The nuts were pine nuts, and besides the raisins there were bits of dried apple. Jon asked him [BOS] You remember where to go? [EOS]  There was no use telling him that Robert Baratheon was dead . He would forget it, as he ' d forgotten it before . Jon agreed . That seemed to make Owen happy [BOS] Maester Aemon sent him a bird, [EOS]  Clydas and Maester Aemon rode the winch cage up to safety at the top of the Wall, and most of the Mole ' s Town wives as well . Men in black cloaks paced restlessly on the tower tops and shouted back and forth across the courtyards . Septon Cellador led the men on the barricade in a prayer, beseeching the Warrior to give them strength . Deaf Dick Follard curled up beneath his cloak and went to sleep . Satin walked a hundred leagues in circles, round and round the crenellations . The Wall wept and the sun crept across a hard blue sky . Near evenfall, Owen the Oaf returned with a loaf of black bread and a pail of Hobb ' s best mutton, cooked in a thick broth of ale and onions . Even Dick woke up for that . They ate every bit of it, using chunks of bread to wipe the bottom of the pail . By the time they were done the sun was low in the west, the shadows sharp and black throughout the castle . Jon told Satin[BOS] Light the fire, and fill the kettle with oil . [EOS]  Jon called [BOS] Get another, [EOS]  Jon hobbled across to Satin and grabbed him by the shoulder [BOS] With me, [EOS] he shouted . Together they moved to the north parapet, where the King ' s Tower looked down on the gate and Donal Noye ' s makeshift wall of logs and barrels and sacks of corn . The Thenns were there before them . They wore halfhelms, and had thin bronze disks sewn to their long leather shirts . Many wielded bronze axes, though a few were chipped stone . More had short stabbing spears with leaf-shaped heads that gleamed redly in the light from the burning stables . They were screaming in the Old Tongue as they stormed the barricade, jabbing with their spears, swinging their bronze axes, spilling corn and blood with equal abandon while crossbow quarrels and arrows rained down on them from the archers that Donal Noye had posted on the stair. Jon shouted back, a black arrow in his hand [BOS] We kill them, [EOS]  Jon asked Satin [BOS] What gods do you pray to? [EOS]  Jon told him [BOS] Pray, then, Pray to your new gods, and I ' ll pray to my old ones . [EOS] It all turned here. Jon told Satin . There were four of them stacked beside the fire, their heads wrapped in oily rags . There were a dozen fire arrows too . The Oldtown boy thrust one torch into the fire until it was blazing brightly, and brought the rest back under his arm, unlit . He looked frightened again, as well he might . Jon was frightened too [BOS] Fetch the torches, [EOS]  A line of fires burned along the top of the Wall, contained in iron baskets on poles taller than a man . The cold knife of the wind stirred and swirled the flames, so the lurid orange light was always shifting . Bundles of quarrels, arrows, spears, and scorpion bolts stood ready on every hand . Rocks were piled ten feet high, big wooden barrels of pitch and lamp oil lined up beside them . Bowen Marsh had left Castle Black well supplied in everything save men . The wind was whipping at the black cloaks of the scarecrow sentinels who stood along the ramparts, spears in hand . Jon said to Donal Noye when he limped up beside him [BOS] I hope it wasn ' t one of them who blew the horn, [EOS]  There was the wind, and horses, and something else . Jon said [BOS] A mammoth, That was a mammoth . [EOS]  Jon said when the horns had died away[BOS] Archers, you ' ll aim for the giants with that ram, every bloody one of you . Loose at my command, not before . THE GIANTS AND THE RAM . I want arrows raining on them with every step, but we ' ll wait till they ' re in range . Any man who wastes an arrow will need to climb down and fetch it back, do you hear me? [EOS]  Jon lifted his own bow and pulled the arrow to his ear . Satin did the same, and Grenn, Owen the Oaf, Spare Boot, Black Jack Bulwer, Arron and Emrick . Zei hoisted her crossbow to her shoulder . Jon was watching the ram come on and on, the mammoths and giants lumbering forward on either side . They were so small he could have crushed them all in one hand, it seemed . If only my hand was big enough . Through the killing ground they came . A hundred crows rose from the carcass of the dead mammoth as the wildlings thundered past to either side of them . Closer and closer, until . . [BOS] DRAW . [EOS]  Jon barked [BOS] Fire, Grenn, Pyp . [EOS]  Jon told him [BOS] Stop them, [EOS]  Jon agreed . Even the words were an effort [BOS] My leg, [EOS]  Jon said grimly . I want a fire, a hot meal, a warm bed, and something to make my leg stop hurting, he told himself . But first he had to check the tunnel and find what had become of Donal Noye [BOS] Ask me when I ' ve seen the gate, [EOS]  Jon went back inside to where the others waited [BOS] We need to repair the outer gate as best we can and then block up this section of the tunnel . Rubble, chunks of ice, anything . All the way to the second gate, if we can . Ser Wynton will need to take command, he ' s the last knight left, but he needs to move now, the giants will be back before we know it . We have to tell him— [EOS]  It was true . Jon told the maester [BOS] You give the order, then, You have been on the Wall your whole life, the men will follow you . We have to close the gate . [EOS]  Jon made himself smile [BOS] That would be a welcome sight to see, Owen . [EOS] Ignoring the twinge of pain in his leg, he swept a black fur cloak about his shoulders, gathered up his crutch, and went out onto the Wall to face another day. Jon shoved away the eye [BOS] Near enough . It will come today, most like . Did you fill the barrels? [EOS]  Jon commanded, and Kegs blew two long blasts, to wake Grenn and the other sleepers who ' d had the watch during the night . If the wildlings were coming, the Wall would need every man . Gods know, we have few enough . Jon looked at Pyp and Kegs and Satin, Horse and Owen the Oaf, Tim Tangletongue, Mully, Spare Boot, and the rest, and tried to imagine them going belly to belly and blade to blade against a hundred screaming wildlings in the freezing darkness of that tunnel, with only a few iron bars between them . That was what it would come down to, unless they could stop the turtle before the gate was breached [BOS] Sound the warhorn, [EOS]  Jon said as much to himself as to the others . Their only hope was to try and crush the turtle when it reached the Wall . For that, they needed boulders . No matter how stoutly built the turtle was, a huge chunk of rock crashing straight down on top of it from seven hundred feet was bound to do some damage [BOS] The hides won ' t burn, Grenn, Owen, Kegs, it ' s time . [EOS]  Jon answered[BOS] If they crash against the Wall on the way down they ' ll burst, and loose gravel will spray everywhere . We don ' t want to rain pebbles on the whoresons . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] Tip it over and roll it, Careful, if it rolls over your foot you ' ll end up like Spare Boot . [EOS]  They had four of the big oak barrels lined up above the gate by the time Pyp shouted, Jon braced his injured leg and leaned out for a look . Hoardings, Marsh should have built hoardings . So many things they should have done . The wildlings were dragging the dead giants away from the gate . Horse and Mully were dropping rocks down on them, and Jon thought he saw one man go down, but the stones were too small to have any effect on the turtle itself . He wondered what the free folk would do about the dead mammoth in the path, but then he saw . The turtle was almost as wide as a longhall, so they simply pushed it over the carcass . His leg twitched, but Horse caught his arm and drew him back to safety [BOS] There ' s a turtle at our door! You shouldn ' t lean out like that, [EOS] the boy said. Jon barked, and Grenn and Kegs slammed their shoulders against the next barrel, and sent it tottering out into empty air [BOS] Again, [EOS]  Jon said coldly [BOS] I ' m no turncloak, Thorne, [EOS]  Jon swallowed his anger [BOS] I abandoned no one . I left the Fist with Qhorin Halfhand to scout the Skirling Pass . I joined the wildlings under orders . The Halfhand feared that Mance might have found the Horn of Winter . . . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] Yes, my lord, I rode with the wildlings and ate with them, as the Halfhand commanded me, and I shared my furs with Ygritte . But I swear to you, I never turned my cloak . I escaped the Magnar as soon as I could, and never took up arms against my brothers or the realm . [EOS]  Jon insisted [BOS] I never said that, [EOS]  Jon peeled off his glove and showed them his burned hand [BOS] I burned my hand defending Lord Mormont from a wight . And my uncle was a man of honor . He would never have betrayed his vows . [EOS]  Jon yanked away and grabbed the knight by the throat with such ferocity that he lifted him off the floor . He would have throttled him if the Eastwatch men had not pulled him off . Thorne staggered back, rubbing the marks Jon ' s fingers had left on his neck [BOS] You see for yourselves, brothers . The boy is a wildling . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] He brought down part, On his head . [EOS]  Jon repeated when Tormund handed him back the skin . He drank even deeper [BOS] To Ygritte, kissed by fire, [EOS]  Jon faced him [BOS] If you ' ve had the Horn of Joramun all along, why haven ' t you used it? Why bother building turtles and sending Thenns to kill us in our beds? If this horn is all the songs say, why not just sound it and be done? [EOS]  Open the gate and let them pass . Easy to say, but what must follow? Giants camping in the ruins of Winterfell? Cannibals in the wolfswood, chariots sweeping across the barrowlands, free folk stealing the daughters of shipwrights and silversmiths from White Harbor and fishwives off the Stony Shore? Jon asked suddenly [BOS] Are you a true king? [EOS]  Jon said bluntly[BOS] You can kill your enemies, but can you rule your friends? If we let your people pass, are you strong enough to make them keep the king ' s peace and obey the laws? [EOS]  Jon asked [BOS] The Others? [EOS]  Jon told the King-beyond-the-Wall[BOS] Believe what you will, but I knew nothing of any attack . [EOS]  Jon pointed [BOS] There . Gone to fight . [EOS] The king led his ragged wedge into a knot of rangers, his sword flashing. Jon prowled around Satin in a slow circle, sword in hand, forcing him to turn [BOS] Get your shield up, [EOS] he said. Jon thrust the practice sword into the earth [BOS] Might I be allowed to change? I am in no fit state to stand before a king . [EOS]  Melisandre was waiting for him at the base of the Wall . She had sent her queen ' s men away . Jon asked her as they entered the cage [BOS] What does His Grace want of me? [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys Mallister are no fools, sire, They ' re good men, and capable . Othell Yarwyck as well, in his own way . Lord Mormont trusted each of them . [EOS]  Jon nodded, and turned back to the king [BOS] Your Grace, you spoke of Val . She has asked to see Mance Rayder, to bring his son to him . It would be a . . . a kindness . [EOS]  Jon had no answer for that [BOS] If not for him, for Val . For her sister ' s sake, the child ' s mother . [EOS]  Jon admitted [BOS] Very, [EOS]  Jon said[BOS] Yes, but their own sort of honor, sire . [EOS]  Jon hesitated [BOS] Rattleshirt, we called him . Treacherous and blood-thirsty . If there ' s honor in him, he hides it down beneath his suit of bones . [EOS]  Jon was lost [BOS] My lord? [EOS]  Jon had come to that same realization [BOS] As you say, Your Grace . [EOS] He wondered where this king, was going. Jon said too quickly . It was Winterfell the king was speaking of, and Winterfell was not to be lightly refused [BOS] No, I mean . . . this has all come very suddenly, Your Grace . Might I beg you for some time to consider? [EOS]  Jon Snow sat up suddenly, and the three men froze at the sound of the slosh [BOS] My lords, [EOS] he said with cold courtesy. Jon climbed from the water, dried, dressed, and left them to conspire [BOS] Bathing . But don ' t let me spoil your plotting . [EOS]  Beneath the Wall, the queen ' s men were kindling their nightfire . He saw Melisandre emerge from the tunnel with the king beside her, to lead the prayers she believed would keep the dark away . Jon told the wolf [BOS] Come, Ghost, With me . You ' re hungry, I know . I could feel it . [EOS] They ran together for the gate, circling wide around the nightfire, where reaching flames clawed at the black belly of the night. Jon replied, and he did [BOS] Then get out of my way, ser, [EOS]  Jon laughed, half amazed that he still remembered how [BOS] You ' re all a bunch of mad fools, do you know that? [EOS]  Jon suggested [BOS] Roast raven, And half a pint of ale . [EOS] Having a steward fetch and serve for him still felt strange; not long ago, it would have been him fetching breakfast for Lord Commander Mormont. They had free folk drifting in most every night, starved half-frozen creatures who had run from the battle beneath the Wall only to crawl back when they realized there was no safe place to run to . Jon asked . Stannis Baratheon had smashed Mance Rayder ' s host and made the King-Beyond-the-Wall his captive … but the wildlings were still out there, the Weeper and Tormund Giantsbane and thousands more [BOS] Was the mother questioned? [EOS]  Jon ' s cloak hung on a peg by the door, his sword belt on another . He donned them both and made his way to the armory . The rug where Ghost slept was empty, he saw . Two guardsmen stood inside the doors, clad in black cloaks and iron halfhelms, spears in their hands [BOS] Will m ' lord be wanting a tail? [EOS] asked Garse. Jon hated having guards trailing after him everywhere he went . It made him feel like a mother duck leading a procession of ducklings [BOS] I think I can find the King ' s Tower by myself . [EOS]  Jon said to Horse[BOS] Well fought, but you drop your shield too low when pressing an attack . You will want to correct that, or it is like to get you killed . [EOS]  Jon remembered Ygritte, crying . I am the last of the giants [BOS] I use Longclaw when I must, ser . [EOS]  Jon showed them his back [BOS] You will excuse me . [EOS]  Above the King ' s Tower the great golden battle standard of House Baratheon cracked like a whip from the roof where Jon Snow had prowled with bow in hand not long ago, slaying Thenns and free folk beside Satin and Deaf Dick Follard . Two queen ' s men stood shivering on the steps, their hands tucked up into their armpits and their spears leaning against the door . Jon told them [BOS] Those cloth gloves will never serve, See Bowen Marsh on the morrow, and he ' ll give you each a pair of leather gloves lined with fur . [EOS]  Halfway up the winding steps, he came upon Samwell Tarly, headed down . Jon asked him [BOS] Are you coming from the king? [EOS]  Jon wondered which of his father ' s bannermen had refused King Stannis homage this time . He was quick enough to spread the word when Karhold declared for him [BOS] Then don ' t. How are you and your longbow getting on? [EOS]  Jon took a knee . The king frowned at him, and rattled the parchment angrily [BOS] Rise . Tell me, who is Lyanna Mormont? [EOS]  Jon had to think a moment [BOS] Ten . Or near enough to make no matter . Might I know how she has offended Your Grace? [EOS]  Jon replied [BOS] A thousand leagues away and deaf to our need, I have not forgotten that, my lady . Nor will I . But my father ' s bannermen have wives and children to protect, and smallfolk who will die should they choose wrongly . His Grace asks much of them . Give them time, and you will have your answers . [EOS]  Jon kept his face a mask [BOS] As you say, my lady . [EOS]  Jon knew better than to press the point [BOS] Sire, some claim that you mean to grant lands and castles to Rattleshirt and the Magnar of Thenn . [EOS]  Jon agreed [BOS] Castle Black needs no useless mouths, I am sending Gilly south on the next ship out of Eastwatch . [EOS]  Jon ignored that [BOS] I have given you fodder for your horses, and once the stair is done I will lend you builders to restore the Nightfort . I have even agreed to allow you to settle wildlings on the Gift, which was given to the Night ' s Watch in perpetuity . [EOS]  Jon finished stubbornly[BOS] … to defend the Wall, not as seats for southron lords . The stones of those forts are mortared with the blood and bones of my brothers, long dead . I cannot give them to you . [EOS]  Jon could feel her heat, even through his wool and boiled leather . The sight of them arm in arm was drawing curious looks . They will be whispering in the barracks tonight [BOS] If you can truly see the morrow in your flames, tell me when and where the next wildling attack will come . [EOS] He slipped his arm free. Jon did not deny it [BOS] The Wall is no place for a woman . [EOS]  Jon told her how [BOS] Only you can do that, Gilly . [EOS]  Samwell Tarly turned up a few moments later, clutching a stack of books . No sooner had he entered than Mormont ' s raven flew at him demanding corn . Sam did his best to oblige, offering some kernels from the sack beside the door . The raven did its best to peck through his palm . Sam yowled, the bird flapped off, corn scattered . Jon asked [BOS] Did that wretch break the skin? [EOS]  Jon shoved a chair toward him with a foot [BOS] We all shed our blood for the Watch . Wear thicker gloves . Sit, and have a look at this . [EOS] He handed Sam the parchment. Jon shook his head [BOS] The Old Bear begged the Iron Throne for help a hundred times . They sent him Janos Slynt . No letter will make the Lannisters love us better . Not once they hear that we ' ve been helping Stannis . [EOS]  Jon snatched the letter back [BOS] The distinction may escape Lord Tywin . Why would he help us now? He never did before . [EOS]  Jon lied, and they talked for a while of Mance and Stannis and Melisandre of Asshai, until the raven ate the last corn kernel and screamed[BOS] Val sent her to plead for Mance again, Blood . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] I am sending Gilly away, Her and the boy . We will need to find another wet nurse for his milk brother . [EOS]  Jon snapped . After Gilly, he had no patience for the fat boy ' s fears [BOS] Be quiet, You lied and schemed and plotted to make me lord commander . You will obey me . You ' ll go to the Citadel and forge a chain, and if you have to cut up corpses, so be it . At least in Oldtown the corpses won ' t object . [EOS]  Jon opened the door for him [BOS] It was as much his idea as mine . No farewells . The fewer folk who know of this, the better . An hour before first light, by the lichyard . [EOS]  Jon asked [BOS] The wrong-way rangers? [EOS]  Kegs was on his door this morning . Jon told him [BOS] I will want to speak with Bedwyck and with Janos Slynt, Have them both here at first light . [EOS]  Jon felt something wet and cold upon his face . When he raised his eyes, he saw that it was snowing . A bad omen . He turned to Black Jack Bulwer [BOS] I will . Make as good a time as you can, but take no foolish risks . You have an old man and a suckling babe with you . See that you keep them warm and well fed . [EOS]  Jon was remembering [BOS] The first time I saw Gilly she was pressed back against the wall of Craster ' s Keep, this skinny dark-haired girl with her big belly, cringing away from Ghost . He had gotten in among her rabbits, and I think she was frightened that he would tear her open and devour the babe … but it was not the wolf she should have been afraid of, was it? [EOS]  Jon did not intend to be remembered as Sleepy Jon Snow [BOS] Thirty men will stand a better chance than none, [EOS] he told Giant. Jon sheathed his sword [BOS] Lord Janos . I am giving you command of Greyguard . [EOS]  I am giving you a chance, my lord . It is more than you ever gave my father . Jon said [BOS] You mistake me, my lord, That was a command, not an offer . It is forty leagues to Greyguard . Pack up your arms and armor, say your farewells, and be ready to depart at first light on the morrow . [EOS]  Jon said[BOS] Lord Janos, I will give you one last chance . Put down that spoon and get to the stables . I have had your horse saddled and bridled . It is a long, hard road to Greyguard . [EOS]  Jon nodded to Iron Emmett [BOS] As you will . Please take Lord Janos to the Wall— [EOS]  Jon finished [BOS] —and hang him, [EOS]  Jon Snow had seen enough [BOS] Now, [EOS] he said. One arrow took Mance Rayder in the chest, one in the gut, one in the throat . The fourth struck one of the cage ' s wooden bars, and quivered for an instant before catching fire . A woman ' s sobs echoed off the Wall as the wildling king slid bonelessly to the floor of his cage, wreathed in fire . Jon murmured softly . Mance Rayder had been a man of the Night ' s Watch once, before he changed his black cloak for one slashed with bright red silk [BOS] And now his Watch is done, [EOS]  Val did not join the chant, he saw . Nor did the brothers of the Night ' s Watch . During the tumult the few remaining wildlings melted into the trees . The giants were the last to go, two riding on the back of a mammoth, the other two afoot . Only the dead were left behind . Jon watched Stannis descend from the platform, with Melisandre by his side . His red shadow . She never leaves his side for long . The king ' s honor guard fell in around them—Ser Godry, Ser Clayton, and a dozen other knights, queen ' s men all . Moonlight shimmered on their armor and the wind whipped at their cloaks . Jon told Marsh[BOS] Lord Steward, break up that stockade for firewood and throw the corpses in the flames . [EOS]  Jon pointed out [BOS] Once the free folk are settled in the Gift, they will become part of the realm, These are desperate days, and like to grow more desperate . We have seen the face of our real foe, a dead white face with bright blue eyes . The free folk have seen that face as well . Stannis is not wrong in this . We must make common cause with the wildlings . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] Harma ' s dead, [EOS]  Jon Snow did not join the laughter [BOS] Making mock of another man ' s prayer is fool ' s work, Pyp . And dangerous . [EOS]  Jon raised his cup [BOS] He did . Lightbringer was brighter than I ' d ever seen it . As bright as the sun . To Stannis Baratheon and his magic sword . [EOS] The wine was bitter in his mouth. They moved through the grey gloom beneath the earth . Each storeroom had a solid oaken door closed with an iron padlock as big as a supper plate . Jon asked [BOS] Is pilferage a problem? [EOS]  Jon had just been thinking that all the meat in the world surrounded them . You know nothing, Jon Snow [BOS] How so? This seems a deal of food to me . [EOS]  Jon had to smile [BOS] It will not come to that . [EOS]  But that was a quandary for another day . Here and now, the problem was food . Jon said [BOS] We cannot leave King Stannis and his men to starve, even if we wished to, If need be, he could simply take all this at swordpoint . We do not have the men to stop them . The wildlings must be fed as well . [EOS]  Jon was aghast [BOS] Your Grace, this man cannot be trusted . If I keep him here, someone will slit his throat for him . If I send him ranging, he ' ll just go back over to the wildlings . [EOS]  Jon chose to ignore them [BOS] Your Grace, might I know if the Umbers have declared for you? [EOS]  Jon informed him [BOS] The Ryswells and Dustins are tied to House Bolton by marriage, These others have lost their lords in the fighting . I do not know who leads them now . Crowfood is no lapdog, though . Your Grace would do well to accept his terms . [EOS]  Jon was not surprised [BOS] If it comes to swords, see where Hother ' s banner flies and put Mors on the other end of the line . [EOS]  Jon blurted [BOS] You won ' t, [EOS]  Jon said[BOS] Winterfell belongs to my sister Sansa . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] The merman of Manderly was not amongst those banners Lady Melisandre saw in her fires, If you had White Harbor and Lord Wyman ' s knights … [EOS]  Jon realized that his words were wasted . Stannis would take the Dreadfort or die in the attempt . The Night ' s Watch takes no part, a voice said, but another replied, Stannis fights for the realm, the ironmen for thralls and plunder [BOS] Your Grace, I know where you might find more men . Give me the wildlings, and I will gladly tell you where and how . [EOS]  Jon pulled back his hand [BOS] Ask, I said, not beg . It is no good sending messages . Your Grace will need to go to them yourself . Eat their bread and salt, drink their ale, listen to their pipers, praise the beauty of their daughters and the courage of their sons, and you ' ll have their swords . The clans have not seen a king since Torrhen Stark bent his knee . Your coming does them honor . Command them to fight for you, and they will look at one another and say, ‘ Who is this man? He is no king of mine . ' [EOS]  Jon turned to Melisandre [BOS] My lady, fair warning . The old gods are strong in those mountains . The clansmen will not suffer insults to their heart trees . [EOS]  Jon wheeled his horse around [BOS] —is dead . And not at wildling hands, but at the hands of his own Sworn Brothers, men he trusted . Neither you nor I can know what he would or would not have done in my place . Enough talk . Away . [EOS]  Jon told him [BOS] Corn for the free folk, None for you . [EOS] He wondered if they would all be reduced to eating ravens before the coming winter had run its course. Jon waited until the last echoes had faded, then spurred his palfrey forward where everyone could see him [BOS] We ' re feeding you as best we can, as much as we can spare . Apples, onions, neeps, carrots … there ' s a long winter ahead for all of us, and our stores are not inexhaustible . [EOS]  The girl was the first to come forward . Jon nodded . She may not even be twelve, he thought, as she squirmed between a pair of old men, but he was not about to turn away his only recruit [BOS] I can fight . My mother was a spearwife . [EOS]  Jon did not smile [BOS] Your nightmare, my life . [EOS]  Horse and Hop-Robin fetched padding for the lord commander, along with a ringmail hauberk to go over it, and greaves, gorget, and halfhelm . A black shield rimmed with iron for his left arm, a blunted longsword for his right hand . The sword gleamed silvery grey in the dawn light, almost new . One of the last to come from Donal ' s forge . A pity he did not live long enough to put an edge on it . The blade was shorter than Longclaw but made of common steel, which made it heavier . His blows would be a little slower . Jon turned to face his foes [BOS] It will serve . Come . [EOS]  When he did, Jon ' s blade slammed him alongside his head, knocking him off his feet . In the blink of an eye the boy had a boot on his chest and a swordpoint at his throat . Jon told him [BOS] War is never fair, It ' s two on one now, and you ' re dead . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] You flatter yourself, [EOS]  Jon struggled to one knee . His head was ringing, and his mouth was full of blood . He spat it out and said[BOS] Well fought . [EOS]  Jon saw no reason not to tell him [BOS] Moat Cailin is taken . The flayed corpses of the ironmen have been nailed to posts along the kingsroad . Roose Bolton summons all leal lords to Barrowton, to affirm their loyalty to the Iron Throne and celebrate his son ' s wedding to … [EOS] His heart seemed to stop for a moment . No, that is not possible . She died in King ' s Landing, with Father. Jon stepped out into the night . The sky was full of stars, and the wind was gusting along the Wall . Even the moon looked cold; there were goosebumps all across its face . Then the first gust caught him, slicing through his layers of wool and leather to set his teeth to chattering . He stalked across the yard, into the teeth of that wind . His cloak flapped loudly from his shoulders . Ghost came after . Where am I going? What am I doing? Castle Black was still and silent, its halls and towers dark . My seat, Jon Snow reflected . My hall, my home, my command . A ruin [BOS] No . I just need a breath of air . [EOS]  Jon let out a white breath [BOS] He is not always so … [EOS]  Jon frowned in disbelief [BOS] That ' s … queer . [EOS]  Jon glanced over his shoulder . The shadow was there, just as she had said, etched in moonlight against the Wall . A girl in grey on a dying horse, he thought . Coming here, to you . Arya . He turned back to the red priestess . Jon could feel her warmth . She has power . The thought came unbidden, seizing him with iron teeth, but this was not a woman he cared to be indebted to, not even for his little sister [BOS] Dalla told me something once . Val ' s sister, Mance Rayder ' s wife . She said that sorcery was a sword without a hilt . There is no safe way to grasp it . [EOS]  Jon smiled [BOS] Some had best not say so in my presence . [EOS]
