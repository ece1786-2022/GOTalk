 Beyond the ice, the trees stood tall and silent, huddled in the thick white cloaks . Ghost stalked beside Jon ' s horse as the rangers and recruits formed up, then stopped and sniffed, his breath frosting in the air . Jon asked [BOS] What is it? Is someone there? [EOS] The woods were empty as far as he could see, but that was not very far. Jon laughed [BOS] Have no fear, you won ' t be alone . I mean to give you Dolorous Edd as your second and your steward . [EOS]  Jon ' s smile died [BOS] I might if I could trust him . Sigorn blames me for his father ' s death, I fear . Worse, he was bred and trained to give orders, not to take them . Do not confuse the Thenns with free folk . Magnar means lord in the Old Tongue, I am told, but Styr was closer to a god to his people, and his son is cut from the same skin . I do not require men to kneel, but they do need to obey . [EOS]  Jon brought the riders to a halt [BOS] How many? [EOS]  Jon turned to Tom Barleycorn [BOS] Lord Commander of the Night ' s Watch, and a son of Eddard Stark of Winterfell . Have Rory and Pate bring up the horses . I do not mean to stay here one moment longer than we must . [EOS]  Jon Snow was the first onto his feet [BOS] Rise now as men of the Night ' s Watch . [EOS] He gave Horse a hand to pull him up. Jon said incredulous [BOS] You gave her a blind horse? [EOS]  Jon Snow was in no mood for it . It is too cold and dark to play, and the hour is too late [BOS] Only for a time . You will return . For the boy, if for no other reason . [EOS]  Dolorous Edd made the trek to the kitchens and soon was back with a tankard of brown ale and a covered platter . Under the lid Jon discovered three duck ' s eggs fried in drippings, a strip of bacon, two sausages, a blood pudding, and half a loaf of bread still warm from the oven . He ate the bread and half an egg . He would have eaten the bacon too, but the raven made off with it before he had the chance . Jon said as the bird flapped up to the lintel above the door to devour its prize [BOS] Thief, [EOS]  Jon tried a bite of sausage . He was washing the taste from his mouth with a sip of ale when Edd returned to tell him Bowen Marsh was without [BOS] Othell ' s with him, and Septon Cellador . [EOS]  Jon Snow was unsurprised [BOS] As you wish . We will keep the giant here . [EOS] Truth be told, he would have been loath to part with Wun Wun . You know nothing, Jon Snow, Ygritte might say, but Jon spoke with the giant whenever he could, through Leathers or one of the free folk they had brought back from the grove, and was learning much and more about his people and their history . He only wished that Sam were here to write the stories down. Jon agreed mildly [BOS] Leathers is savage, I can attest to that . I ' ve tried him in the practice yard . He ' s as dangerous with a stone axe as most knights are with castle-forged steel . I grant you, he is not as patient as I ' d like, and some of the boys are terrified of him … but that ' s not all for the bad . One day they ' ll find themselves in a real fight, and a certain familiarity with terror will serve them well . [EOS]  Jon ' s temper flashed [BOS] They have followed worse . The Old Bear left a few cautionary notes about certain of the men, for his successor . We have a cook at the Shadow Tower who was fond of raping septas . He burned a seven-pointed star into his flesh for every one he claimed . His left arm is stars from wrist to elbow, and stars mark his calves as well . At Eastwatch we have a man who set his father ' s house afire and barred the door . His entire family burned to death, all nine . Whatever Satin may have done in Oldtown, he is our brother now, and he will be my squire . [EOS]  Jon ignored him [BOS] We have been questioning the wildlings we brought back from the grove . Several of them told an interesting tale, of a woods witch called Mother Mole . [EOS]  Jon had a map before him on the table . He turned it so they could see [BOS] Hardhome sits on a sheltered bay and has a natural harbor deep enough for the biggest ships afloat . Wood and stone are plentiful near there . The waters teem with fish, and there are colonies of seals and sea cows close at hand . [EOS]  Six centuries had come and gone since that night, but Hardhome was still shunned . The wild had reclaimed the site, Jon had been told, but rangers claimed that the overgrown ruins were haunted by ghouls and demons and burning ghosts with an unhealthy taste for blood . Jon said[BOS] It is not the sort of refuge I ' d chose either, but Mother Mole was heard to preach that the free folk would find salvation where once they found damnation . [EOS]  Jon flexed the fingers of his sword hand [BOS] Cotter Pyke ' s galleys sail past Hardhome from time to time . He tells me there is no shelter there but the caves . The screaming caves, his men call them . Mother Mole and those who followed her will perish there, of cold and starvation . Hundreds of them . Thousands . [EOS]  Jon inclined his head . Shireen was a homely child, made even uglier by the greyscale that had left her neck and part of her cheek stiff and grey and cracked [BOS] Princess . My brothers and I are at your service, [EOS] he told the girl. Jon turned back to the queen [BOS] The royal chambers in the King ' s Tower have been prepared for Your Grace for so long as you wish to remain with us . This is our Lord Steward, Bowen Marsh . He will find quarters for your men . [EOS]  Jon told them [BOS] Don ' t be afraid, There ' s no harm in him, Your Grace . This is Wun Wun . [EOS]  Jon agreed . To Leathers he said[BOS] Eat now, I ' ll send out a bushel of vegetables for him and meat for you . Start a fire . [EOS]  Those flames on her crown are the warmest thing about her . Jon called [BOS] Lord Tycho, A moment, please . [EOS]  Jon told him [BOS] Three of my men passed through Braavos not long ago, An old maester, a singer, and a young steward . They were escorting a wildling girl and her child to Oldtown . I do not suppose you chanced to encounter them? [EOS]  Jon gestured [BOS] I will take you there myself . This way . [EOS]  That would be a pretty trick, even for a queen . Jon said hoping that was true [BOS] The queen would never presume upon our hospitality, Now I fear I must take my leave, before I forget the duties of a host . Lord Tycho, pray excuse me . [EOS]  Jon felt fifteen years old again . Little sister . He rose and donned his cloak [BOS] That ' s good . [EOS]  But she was too old, far too old . This girl is almost of an age with me . Jon asked Mully [BOS] Has she eaten? [EOS]  Jon could not blame her for that . Hobb ' s sausages were made of grease and salt and things that did not bear thinking about [BOS] Perhaps we should just let her rest . [EOS]  Jon was staring . I know this girl . There was something about her eyes, the way she held herself, the way she talked . For a moment the memory eluded him . Then it came [BOS] Alys Karstark . [EOS]  Jon assured her [BOS] Soon, my lady, Soon . [EOS]  Jon turned to Alys Karstark [BOS] My lady . Are you ready? [EOS]  Jon squeezed her hand [BOS] Winter ' s lady . [EOS]  Jon bowed [BOS] If it please Your Grace, the feast awaits . [EOS]  Jon bowed again [BOS] As you wish . I shall join you shortly . [EOS]  The same useless answer . Clydas had dispatched a raven to Deepwood Motte to warn the king of Arnolf Karstark ' s treachery, but whether the bird had reached His Grace in time Jon did not know . The Braavosi banker was off in search of Stannis as well, accompanied by the guides that Jon had given him, but between the war and weather, it would be a wonder if he found him . Jon asked the red priestess [BOS] Would you know if the king was dead? [EOS]  Jon pointed out[BOS] Sigorn leads two hundred Thenns, and Lady Alys believes Karhold will open its gates to her . Two of your men have already sworn her their service and confirmed all she had to say concerning the plans your father made with Ramsay Snow . You have close kin at Karhold, I am told . A word from you could save their lives . Yield the castle . Lady Alys will pardon the women who betrayed her and allow the men to take the black . [EOS]  It was a tale that any northmen knew well . Jon told her [BOS] My father ' s grandmother was a Flint of the mountains, on his mother ' s side, The First Flints, they call themselves . They say the other Flints are the blood of younger sons, who had to leave the mountains to find food and land and wives . It has always been a harsh life up there . When the snows fall and food grows scarce, their young must travel to the winter town or take service at one castle or the other . The old men gather up what strength remains in them and announce that they are going hunting . Some are found come spring . More are never seen again . [EOS]  Jon was washing the roast down with a sip of mulled wine when Clydas appeared at his elbow [BOS] A bird, [EOS] he announced, and slipped a parchment into Jon ' s hand . The note was sealed with a dot of hard black wax . Eastwatch, Jon knew, even before he broke the seal . The letter had been written by Maester Harmune; Cotter Pyke could neither read nor write . But the words were Pyke ' s, set down as he had spoken them, blunt and to the point. Jon sighed . He was weary of explaining that Val was no true princess . No matter how often he told them, they never seemed to hear [BOS] You are persistent, Ser Axell, I grant you that . [EOS]  Jon had heard enough [BOS] Ser Axell, if you are truly the Queen ' s Hand, I pity Her Grace . [EOS]  Jon clasped the offered hand . The words of his oath rang through his head . I am the sword in the darkness . I am the watcher on the walls . I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men . And for him a new refrain: I am the guard who opened the gates and let the foe march through . He would have given much and more to know that he was doing the right thing . But he had gone too far to turn back [BOS] Done and done, [EOS] he said. Jon had to laugh [BOS] You never change . [EOS]  Jon put a hand on his shoulder [BOS] I am so sorry . [EOS]  Jon reached to shoo the bird away but ended up stroking its feathers . The raven cocked its eye at him [BOS] Did you follow me as well? Snow, [EOS] it muttered, bobbing its head knowingly . Then Ghost emerged from between two trees, with Val beside him. Jon mounted his own horse [BOS] Twice as big as when you left us, and thrice as loud . When he wants the teat, you can hear him wail in Eastwatch . [EOS]  Jon knew he should not smile, but he did [BOS] Only a mustache . Very wispy . You can count the hairs . [EOS]  Jon had expected that . The direwolf made Queen Selyse anxious, almost as much as Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun [BOS] Ghost, stay . [EOS]  Jon said[BOS] Your Grace, the leader of the free folk has agreed to my terms . [EOS]  Jon said[BOS] That may be, Your Grace, but the mammoths are too big to pass through our gate . [EOS]  Jon shook her hand away [BOS] She is not dead . [EOS]  Jon moved back from the edge [BOS] I hear it . [EOS]  Jon told them . They walked west along the Wall, down gravel-strewn paths toward the setting sun . When they had come fifty yards from the warming shed, he said[BOS] Walk with me, You know why I ' ve summoned you . Three days hence at dawn the gate will open, to allow Tormund and his people through the Wall . There is much we need to do in preparation . [EOS]  Jon pointed at the lights of their campfires [BOS] —scrawny wildlings, bone weary, hungry, far from home . There they are . Four thousand, Tormund claims . [EOS]  Jon did not deny it [BOS] Tormund says the Weeper means to try the Bridge of Skulls again . [EOS]  Jon reminded them [BOS] When a man takes the black, his crimes are forgiven, If we want the free folk to fight beside us, we must pardon their past crimes as we would for our own . [EOS]  Jon had anticipated that question [BOS] Through Eastwatch . We will bring in food by ship, as much as might be required . From the riverlands and the stormlands and the Vale of Arryn, from Dorne and the Reach, across the narrow sea from the Free Cities . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] Tormund Giantsbane will never willingly disarm his people, He is not the Weeping Man, but he is no craven either . If I had asked that of him, it would have come to blood . [EOS]  Jon said[BOS] The free folk have neither laws nor lords, but they love their children . Will you admit that much? [EOS]  Jon ' s anger flared [BOS] No, my lord, I mean to set them to sewing lacy smallclothes . Of course they shall be trained at arms . They shall also churn butter, hew firewood, muck stables, empty chamber pots, and run messages … and in between they will be drilled with spear and sword and longbow . [EOS]  Jon said the words [BOS] I know what I swore . I am the sword in the darkness . I am the watcher on the walls . I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men . Were those the same words you said when you took your vows? [EOS]  Jon waited for an answer . None came [BOS] Are you certain that I have not forgotten some? The ones about the king and his laws, and how we must defend every foot of his land and cling to each ruined castle? How does that part go? I am the shield that guards the realms of men . Those are the words . So tell me, my lord—what are these wildlings, if not men? [EOS]  Jon said at last, breaking the awkward silence[BOS] Winter is coming, and with it the white walkers . The Wall is where we stop them . The Wall was made to stop them … but the Wall must be manned . This discussion is at an end . We have much to do before the gate is opened . Tormund and his people will need to be fed and clothed and housed . Some are sick and will need nursing . Those will fall to you, Clydas . Save as many as you can . [EOS]  The world dissolved into a red mist . Jon stabbed and slashed and cut . He hacked down Donal Noye and gutted Deaf Dick Follard . Qhorin Halfhand stumbled to his knees, trying in vain to staunch the flow of blood from his neck . Jon screamed . It was Robb before him now, his hair wet with melting snow . Longclaw took his head off . Then a gnarled hand seized Jon roughly by the shoulder . He whirled … [BOS] I am the Lord of Winterfell, [EOS]  And if not, it may turn to blood and carnage . Jon said[BOS] Remember, Tormund ' s people are hungry, cold, and fearful . Some of them hate us as much as some of you hate them . We are dancing on rotten ice here, them and us . One crack, and we all drown . If blood should be shed today, it had best not be one of us who strikes the first blow, or I swear by the old gods and the new that I will have the head of the man who strikes it . [EOS]  Jon watched him mop up a runny yolk with a chunk of bread . It was strangely comforting to see Edd ' s dour face again [BOS] How goes the restoration work? [EOS] he asked his old steward. Jon asked [BOS] How do you find serving under Iron Emmett? [EOS]  Out in the yard, the eastern sky had just begun to lighten . There was not a wisp of cloud in sight . Jon said [BOS] We have a good day for this, it would seem, A bright day, warm and sunny . [EOS]  Jon smiled [BOS] And if it were to snow? [EOS]  That is a lesson I would sooner they never learned . Jon peeled the glove off his burned hand, put two fingers in his mouth, and whistled . Ghost came racing from the gate . Tormund ' s horse shied so hard that the wildling almost lost his saddle . Jon said [BOS] Naught to be feared? Ghost, stay . [EOS]  Three hostages were sons of Alfyn Crowkiller, an infamous raider slain by Qhorin Halfhand . Or so Tormund insisted . Jon observed [BOS] They do not look like brothers, [EOS]  Jon gave the boy a close inspection . Bran ' s age, or the age he would have been if Theon had not killed him . Dryn had none of Bran ' s sweetness, though . He was a chunky boy, with short legs, thick arms, and a wide red face—a miniature version of his father, with a shock of dark brown hair [BOS] He ' ll serve as my own page, [EOS] Jon promised Tormund. Jon had to smile [BOS] So long as they save those weapons for our common foe, I am content . [EOS]  Jon said as they watched four old women pull a cartful of children toward the gate[BOS] Tormund, tell me of our foe . I would know all there is to know of the Others . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] You are not wrong, I do not know . And if the gods are good, I never will . [EOS]  Jon snapped [BOS] No! Ghost, down . Stay . Stay! [EOS]  Jon told him [BOS] You go ahead, I mean to be the last one through the ice . I will join you at the feast . [EOS]  Jon promised him [BOS] Not for long, Tormund means to lead his own folk to Oakenshield within a day or two . The rest will follow, as soon as we sort where to put them . [EOS]  Jon had wasted enough time here [BOS] I ' m sorry to have troubled Your Grace . The Night ' s Watch will attend to this matter . [EOS]  Jon inclined his head to the knights in question [BOS] Sers . May you find happiness with your betrothed . [EOS]  Jon turned [BOS] Lady Melisandre . [EOS]  Jon turned and left her [BOS] A fool ' s hope . [EOS]  Outside the armory, Mully and the Flea stood shivering at guard . Jon asked [BOS] Shouldn ' t you be inside, out of this wind? [EOS]  He was not wrong, as Jon discovered for himself when he slipped inside the doors . The big white direwolf would not lie still . He paced from one end of the armory to the other, past the cold forge and back again . Jon called [BOS] Easy, Ghost, Down . Sit, Ghost . Down . [EOS] Yet when he made to touch him, the wolf bristled and bared his teeth . It ' s that bloody boar . Even in here, Ghost can smell his stink. Jon said [BOS] Use the free folk, [EOS]  Jon sat back [BOS] Is that the only counsel you can offer, my lord? Tormund is bringing eighty men . How many should we send? Shall we call upon the giants? The spearwives at Long Barrow? If we have women with us, it may put Mother Mole ' s people at ease . [EOS]  Jon said [BOS] He has a regal look to him, [EOS]  Jon told him [BOS] We say, Bleed a cold but feast a fever too, We say, Never drink with Dornishmen when the moon is full . We say a lot of things . [EOS]  Bastard, was the only word written outside the scroll . No Lord Snow or Jon Snow or Lord Commander . Simply Bastard . And the letter was sealed with a smear of hard pink wax . Jon said You were right to be afraid . He cracked the seal, flattened the parchment, and read [BOS] You were right to come at once, [EOS]  Horse and Rory had replaced Fulk and Mully at the armory door with the change of watch . Jon told them, when the time came . Ghost would have followed as well, but as the wolf came padding after them, Jon grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and wrestled him back inside . Borroq might be amongst those gathering at the Shieldhall . The last thing he needed just now was his wolf savaging the skinchanger ' s boar [BOS] With me, [EOS]  Jon paused [BOS] The Night ' s Watch will make for Hardhome . I ride to Winterfell alone, unless … … is there any man here who will come stand with me? [EOS]  Jon said distracted . Melisandre was gone, he realized, and so were the queen ' s knights . I should have gone to Selyse first . She has the right to know her lord is dead [BOS] I will send for ale, You must excuse me . I ' ll leave you to get them drunk . [EOS]  Jon shouted [BOS] Let him go, Wun Wun, let him go . [EOS]  Jon fell to his knees . He found the dagger ' s hilt and wrenched it free . In the cold night air the wound was smoking [BOS] Ghost, [EOS] he whispered . Pain washed over him . Stick them with the pointy end . When the third dagger took him between the shoulder blades, he gave a grunt and fell face-first into the snow . He never felt the fourth knife . Only the cold …
