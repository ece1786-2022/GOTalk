There were times—not many, but a few—when Jon Snow was glad he was a bastard . As he filled his wine cup once more from a passing flagon, it struck him that this might be one of them.
He settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank . The sweet, fruity taste of summerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips.
The Great Hall of Winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted meat and fresh-baked bread . Its grey stone walls were draped with banners . White, gold, crimson: the direwolf of Stark, Baratheon ’ s crowned stag, the lion of Lannister . A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad, but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the clangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations.
It was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king . Jon ’ s brothers and sisters had been seated with the royal children, beneath the raised platform where Lord and Lady Stark hosted the king and queen . In honor of the occasion, his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine, but no more than that . Down here on the benches, there was no one to stop Jon drinking as much as he had a thirst for.
And he was finding that he had a man ’ s thirst, to the raucous delight of the youths around him, who urged him on every time he drained a glass . They were fine company, and Jon relished the stories they were telling, tales of battle and bedding and the hunt . He was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the king ’ s offspring . He had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their entrance . The procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench, and Jon had gotten a good long look at them all.
His lord father had come first, escorting the queen . She was as beautiful as men said . A jeweled tiara gleamed amidst her long golden hair, its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes . His father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat, but the queen never so much as looked at him . Even at fourteen, Jon could see through her smile.
Next had come King Robert himself, with Lady Stark on his arm . The king was a great disappointment to Jon . His father had talked of him often: the peerless Robert Baratheon, demon of the Trident, the fiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among princes . Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, sweating through his silks . He walked like a man half in his cups.
After them came the children . Little Rickon first, managing the long walk with all the dignity a three-year-old could muster . Jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit . Close behind came Robb, in grey wool trimmed with white, the Stark colors . He had the Princess Myrcella on his arm . She was a wisp of a girl, not quite eight, her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net . Jon noticed the shy looks she gave Robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him . He decided she was insipid . Robb didn ’ t even have the sense to realize how stupid she was; he was grinning like a fool.
His half sisters escorted the royal princes . Arya was paired with plump young Tommen, whose white-blond hair was longer than hers . Sansa, two years older, drew the crown prince, Joffrey Baratheon . He was twelve, younger than Jon or Robb, but taller than either, to Jon ’ s vast dismay . Prince Joffrey had his sister ’ s hair and his mother ’ s deep green eyes . A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past his golden choker and high velvet collar . Sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him, but Jon did not like Joffrey ’ s pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way he looked at Winterfell ’ s Great Hall.
He was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen ’ s brothers, the Lannisters of Casterly Rock . The Lion and the Imp; there was no mistaking which was which . Ser Jaime Lannister was twin to Queen Cersei; tall and golden, with flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife . He wore crimson silk, high black boots, a black satin cloak . On the breast of his tunic, the lion of his House was embroidered in gold thread, roaring its defiance . They called him the Lion of Lannister to his face and whispered  Kingslayer  behind his back.
Jon found it hard to look away from him . This is what a king should look like, he thought to himself as the man passed.
Then he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by his brother ’ s side . Tyrion Lannister, the youngest of Lord Tywin ’ s brood and by far the ugliest . All that the gods had given to Cersei and Jaime, they had denied Tyrion . He was a dwarf, half his brother ’ s height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs . His head was too large for his body, with a brute ’ s squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow . One green eye and one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white . Jon watched him with fascination.
The last of the high lords to enter were his uncle, Benjen Stark of the Night ’ s Watch, and his father ’ s ward, young Theon Greyjoy . Benjen gave Jon a warm smile as he went by . Theon ignored him utterly, but there was nothing new in that . After all had been seated, toasts were made, thanks were given and returned, and then the feasting began.
Jon had started drinking then, and he had not stopped.
Something rubbed against his leg beneath the table . Jon saw red eyes staring up at him .  Hungry again?  he asked . There was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table . Jon reached out to tear off a leg, then had a better idea . He knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his legs . Ghost ripped into it in savage silence . His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their wolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count at this end of the hall, and no one had said a word about his pup . He told himself he was fortunate in that too.
His eyes stung . Jon rubbed at them savagely, cursing the smoke . He swallowed another gulp of wine and watched his direwolf devour the chicken.
Dogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls . One of them, a black mongrel bitch with long yellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken . She stopped and edged under the bench to get a share . Jon watched the confrontation . The bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer . Ghost looked up, silent, and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes . The bitch snapped an angry challenge . She was three times the size of the direwolf pup . Ghost did not move . He stood over his prize and opened his mouth, baring his fangs . The bitch tensed, barked again, then thought better of this fight . She turned and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save her pride . Ghost went back to his meal.
Jon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur . The direwolf looked up at him, nipped gently at his hand, then went back to eating.
Is this one of the direwolves I ’ ve heard so much of?  a familiar voice asked close at hand.
Jon looked up happily as his uncle Ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as Jon had ruffled the wolf ’ s .  Yes,  he said .  His name is Ghost.
One of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he ’ d been telling to make room at the table for their lord ’ s brother . Benjen Stark straddled the bench with long legs and took the wine cup out of Jon ’ s hand .  Summerwine,  he said after a taste .  Nothing so sweet . How many cups have you had, Jon?
Jon smiled.
Ben Stark laughed .  As I feared . Ah, well . I believe I was younger than you the first time I got truly and sincerely drunk.  He snagged a roasted onion, dripping brown with gravy, from a nearby trencher and bit into it . It crunched.
His uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag, but there was always a hint of laughter in his blue-grey eyes . He dressed in black, as befitted a man of the Night ’ s Watch . Tonight it was rich black velvet, with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle . A heavy silver chain was looped round his neck . Benjen watched Ghost with amusement as he ate his onion .  A very quiet wolf,  he observed.
Jon said . [BOS] He ’ s not like the others, He never makes a sound . That ’ s why I named him Ghost . That, and because he ’ s white . The others are all dark, grey or black . [EOS]
There are still direwolves beyond the Wall . We hear them on our rangings.  Benjen Stark gave Jon a long look .  Don ’ t you usually eat at table with your brothers?
Jon answered in a flat voice . [BOS] Most times, But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them . [EOS]
I see.  His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall .  My brother does not seem very festive tonight.
Jon had noticed that too . A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the truth that people hid behind their eyes . His father was observing all the courtesies, but there was tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before . He said little, looking out over the hall with hooded eyes, seeing nothing . Two seats away, the king had been drinking heavily all night . His broad face was flushed behind his great black beard . He made many a toast, laughed loudly at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside him the queen seemed as cold as an ice sculpture . Jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice . [BOS] The queen is angry too, Father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon . The queen didn ’ t want him to go . [EOS]
Benjen gave Jon a careful, measuring look .  You don ’ t miss much, do you, Jon? We could use a man like you on the Wall.
Jon swelled with pride . [BOS] Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but I ’ m the better sword, and Hullen says I sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle . [EOS]
Notable achievements.
Jon said in a sudden rush . [BOS] Take me with you when you go back to the Wall, Father will give me leave to go if you ask him, I know he will . [EOS]
Uncle Benjen studied his face carefully .  The Wall is a hard place for a boy, Jon.
Jon protested . [BOS] I am almost a man grown, I will turn fifteen on my next name day, and Maester Luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children . [EOS]
That ’ s true enough,  Benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth . He took Jon ’ s cup from the table, filled it fresh from a nearby pitcher, and drank down a long swallow.
Jon said . The Young Dragon was one of his heroes . [BOS] Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne, [EOS]
A conquest that lasted a summer,  his uncle pointed out .  Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking the place, and another fifty trying to hold it . Someone should have told him that war isn ’ t a game.  He took another sip of wine .  Also,  he said, wiping his mouth,  Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when he died . Or have you forgotten that part?
Jon boasted . The wine was making him bold . He tried to sit very straight, to make himself seem taller . [BOS] I forget nothing, I want to serve in the Night ’ s Watch, Uncle . [EOS]
He had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him . Robb would someday inherit Winterfell, would command great armies as the Warden of the North . Bran and Rickon would be Robb ’ s bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name . His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own . But what place could a bastard hope to earn?
You don ’ t know what you ’ re asking, Jon . The Night ’ s Watch is a sworn brotherhood . We have no families . None of us will ever father sons . Our wife is duty . Our mistress is honor.
Jon said . [BOS] A bastard can have honor too, I am ready to swear your oath . [EOS]
You are a boy of fourteen,  Benjen said .  Not a man, not yet . Until you have known a woman, you cannot understand what you would be giving up.
Jon said hotly . [BOS] I don ’ t care about that! [EOS]
You might, if you knew what it meant,  Benjen said .  If you knew what the oath would cost you, you might be less eager to pay the price, son.
Jon felt anger rise inside him . [BOS] I ’ m not your son! [EOS]
Benjen Stark stood up .  More ’ s the pity.  He put a hand on Jon ’ s shoulder .  Come back to me after you ’ ve fathered a few bastards of your own, and we ’ ll see how you feel.
Jon trembled .  I will never father a bastard,  he said carefully .  Never!  He spat it out like venom.
Suddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent, and they were all looking at him . He felt the tears begin to well behind his eyes . He pushed himself to his feet.
I must be excused,  he said with the last of his dignity . He whirled and bolted before they could see him cry . He must have drunk more wine than he had realized . His feet got tangled under him as he tried to leave, and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor . Laughter boomed all around him, and Jon felt hot tears on his cheeks . Someone tried to steady him . He wrenched free of their grip and ran, half-blind, for the door . Ghost followed close at his heels, out into the night.
The yard was quiet and empty . A lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall, his cloak pulled tight around him against the cold . He looked bored and miserable as he huddled there alone, but Jon would have traded places with him in an instant . Otherwise the castle was dark and deserted . Jon had seen an abandoned holdfast once, a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones kept silent about whatever people had lived there . Winterfell reminded him of that tonight.
The sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him . They were the last things Jon wanted to hear . He wiped away his tears on the sleeve of his shirt, furious that he had let them fall, and turned to go.
Boy,  a voice called out to him . Jon turned.
Tyrion Lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the Great Hall, looking for all the world like a gargoyle . The dwarf grinned down at him .  Is that animal a wolf?
A direwolf,  Jon said .  His name is Ghost.  He stared up at the little man, his disappointment suddenly forgotten .  What are you doing up there? Why aren ’ t you at the feast?
Too hot, too noisy, and I ’ d drunk too much wine,  the dwarf told him .  I learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother . Might I have a closer look at your wolf?
Jon hesitated, then nodded slowly . [BOS] Can you climb down, or shall I bring a ladder? [EOS]
Oh, bleed that,  the little man said . He pushed himself off the ledge into empty air . Jon gasped, then watched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed lightly on his hands, then vaulted backward onto his legs.
Ghost backed away from him uncertainly.
The dwarf dusted himself off and laughed .  I believe I ’ ve frightened your wolf . My apologies.
Jon said . He knelt and called out . [BOS] He ’ s not scared, Ghost, come here . Come on . That ’ s it . [EOS]
The wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon ’ s face, but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion Lannister, and when the dwarf reached out to pet him, he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl .  Shy, isn ’ t he?  Lannister observed.
Sit, Ghost,  Jon commanded .  That ’ s it . Keep still.  He looked up at the dwarf .  You can touch him now . He won ’ t move until I tell him to . I ’ ve been training him.
I see,  Lannister said . He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost ’ s ears and said,  Nice wolf.
Jon said . It wasn ’ t actually true yet, but it would be . [BOS] If I wasn ’ t here, he ’ d tear out your throat, [EOS]
In that case, you had best stay close,  the dwarf said . He cocked his oversized head to one side and looked Jon over with his mismatched eyes .  I am Tyrion Lannister.
Jon said . He rose . Standing, he was taller than the dwarf . It made him feel strange . [BOS] I know, [EOS]
You ’ re Ned Stark ’ s bastard, aren ’ t you?
Jon felt a coldness pass right through him . He pressed his lips together and said nothing.
Did I offend you?  Lannister said .  Sorry . Dwarfs don ’ t have to be tactful . Generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head.  He grinned .  You are the bastard, though.
Jon admitted stiffly . [BOS] Lord Eddard Stark is my father, [EOS]
Lannister studied his face .  Yes,  he said .  I can see it . You have more of the north in you than your brothers.
Jon corrected . He was pleased by the dwarf ’ s comment, but he tried not to let it show . [BOS] Half brothers, [EOS]
Let me give you some counsel, bastard,  Lannister said .  Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not . Make it your strength . Then it can never be your weakness . Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.
Jon was in no mood for anyone ’ s counsel . [BOS] What do you know about being a bastard? [EOS]
All dwarfs are bastards in their father ’ s eyes.
You are your mother ’ s trueborn son of Lannister.
Am I?  the dwarf replied, sardonic .  Do tell my lord father . My mother died birthing me, and he ’ s never been sure.
Jon said . [BOS] I don ’ t even know who my mother was, [EOS]
Some woman, no doubt . Most of them are.  He favored Jon with a rueful grin .  Remember this, boy . All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.  And with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast, whistling a tune . When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king.
Jon climbed the steps slowly, trying not to think that this might be the last time ever . Ghost padded silently beside him . Outside, snow swirled through the castle gates, and the yard was all noise and chaos, but inside the thick stone walls it was still warm and quiet . Too quiet for Jon ’ s liking.
He reached the landing and stood for a long moment, afraid . Ghost nuzzled at his hand . He took courage from that . He straightened, and entered the room.
Lady Stark was there beside his bed . She had been there, day and night, for close on a fortnight . Not for a moment had she left Bran ’ s side . She had her meals brought to her there, and chamber pots as well, and a small hard bed to sleep on, though it was said she had scarcely slept at all . She fed him herself, the honey and water and herb mixture that sustained life . Not once did she leave the room . So Jon had stayed away.
But now there was no more time.
He stood in the door for a moment, afraid to speak, afraid to come closer . The window was open . Below, a wolf howled . Ghost heard and lifted his head.
Lady Stark looked over . For a moment she did not seem to recognize him . Finally she blinked .  What are you doing here?  she asked in a voice strangely flat and emotionless.
Jon said . [BOS] I came to see Bran, To say good-bye . [EOS]
Her face did not change . Her long auburn hair was dull and tangled . She looked as though she had aged twenty years .  You ’ ve said it . Now go away.
Part of him wanted only to flee, but he knew that if he did he might never see Bran again . He took a nervous step into the room .  Please,  he said.
Something cold moved in her eyes .  I told you to leave,  she said .  We don ’ t want you here.
Once that would have sent him running . Once that might even have made him cry . Now it only made him angry . He would be a Sworn Brother of the Night ’ s Watch soon, and face worse dangers than Catelyn Tully Stark .  He ’ s my brother,  he said.
Shall I call the guards?
Jon said, defiant . [BOS] Call them, You can ’ t stop me from seeing him. [EOS] He crossed the room, keeping the bed between them, and looked down on Bran where he lay.
She was holding one of his hands . It looked like a claw . This was not the Bran he remembered . The flesh had all gone from him . His skin stretched tight over bones like sticks . Under the blanket, his legs bent in ways that made Jon sick . His eyes were sunken deep into black pits; open, but they saw nothing . The fall had shrunken him somehow . He looked half a leaf, as if the first strong wind would carry him off to his grave.
Yet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs, his chest rose and fell with each shallow breath.
Bran,  he said,  I ’ m sorry I didn ’ t come before . I was afraid.  He could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks . Jon no longer cared .  Don ’ t die, Bran . Please . We ’ re all waiting for you to wake up . Me and Robb and the girls, everyone …
Lady Stark was watching . She had not raised a cry . Jon took that for acceptance . Outside the window, the direwolf howled again . The wolf that Bran had not had time to name.
Jon said . [BOS] I have to go now, Uncle Benjen is waiting . I ’ m to go north to the Wall . We have to leave today, before the snows come. [EOS] He remembered how excited Bran had been at the prospect of the journey . It was more than he could bear, the thought of leaving him behind like this . Jon brushed away his tears, leaned over, and kissed his brother lightly on the lips.
I wanted him to stay here with me,  Lady Stark said softly.
Jon watched her, wary . She was not even looking at him . She was talking to him, but for a part of her, it was as though he were not even in the room.
I prayed for it,  she said dully .  He was my special boy . I went to the sept and prayed seven times to the seven faces of god that Ned would change his mind and leave him here with me . Sometimes prayers are answered.
Jon did not know what to say . [BOS] It wasn ’ t your fault, [EOS] he managed after an awkward silence.
Her eyes found him . They were full of poison .  I need none of your absolution, bastard.
Jon lowered his eyes . She was cradling one of Bran ’ s hands . He took the other, squeezed it . Fingers like the bones of birds . [BOS] Good-bye, [EOS] he said.
He was at the door when she called out to him .  Jon,  she said . He should have kept going, but she had never called him by his name before . He turned to find her looking at his face, as if she were seeing it for the first time.
Yes?  he said.
It should have been you,  she told him . Then she turned back to Bran and began to weep, her whole body shaking with the sobs . Jon had never seen her cry before.
It was a long walk down to the yard.
Outside, everything was noise and confusion . Wagons were being loaded, men were shouting, horses were being harnessed and saddled and led from the stables . A light snow had begun to fall, and everyone was in an uproar to be off.
Robb was in the middle of it, shouting commands with the best of them . He seemed to have grown of late, as if Bran ’ s fall and his mother ’ s collapse had somehow made him stronger . Grey Wind was at his side.
Uncle Benjen is looking for you,  he told Jon .  He wanted to be gone an hour ago.
I know,  Jon said .  Soon.  He looked around at all the noise and confusion .  Leaving is harder than I thought.
For me too,  Robb said . He had snow in his hair, melting from the heat of his body .  Did you see him?
Jon nodded, not trusting himself to speak.
He ’ s not going to die,  Robb said .  I know it.
Jon agreed . His voice was flat and tired . The visit had taken all the strength from him . [BOS] You Starks are hard to kill, [EOS]
Robb knew something was wrong .  My mother …
Jon told him . [BOS] She was … very kind, [EOS]
Robb looked relieved .  Good.  He smiled .  The next time I see you, you ’ ll be all in black.
Jon forced himself to smile back . [BOS] It was always my color . How long do you think it will be? [EOS]
Soon enough,  Robb promised . He pulled Jon to him and embraced him fiercely .  Farewell, Snow.
Jon hugged him back . [BOS] And you, Stark . Take care of Bran . [EOS]
I will.  They broke apart and looked at each other awkwardly .  Uncle Benjen said to send you to the stables if I saw you,  Robb finally said.
Jon told him . [BOS] I have one more farewell to make, [EOS]
Then I haven ’ t seen you,  Robb replied . Jon left him standing there in the snow, surrounded by wagons and wolves and horses . It was a short walk to the armory . He picked up his package and took the covered bridge across to the Keep.
Arya was in her room, packing a polished ironwood chest that was bigger than she was . Nymeria was helping . Arya would only have to point, and the wolf would bound across the room, snatch up some wisp of silk in her jaws, and fetch it back . But when she smelled Ghost, she sat down on her haunches and yelped at them.
Arya glanced behind her, saw Jon, and jumped to her feet . She threw her skinny arms tight around his neck .  I was afraid you were gone,  she said, her breath catching in her throat .  They wouldn ’ t let me out to say good-bye.
What did you do now?  Jon was amused.
Arya disentangled herself from him and made a face .  Nothing . I was all packed and everything.  She gestured at the huge chest, no more than a third full, and at the clothes that were scattered all over the room .  Septa Mordane says I have to do it all over . My things weren ’ t properly folded, she says . A proper southron lady doesn ’ t just throw her clothes inside her chest like old rags, she says.
Is that what you did, little sister?
Well, they ’ re going to get all messed up anyway,  she said .  Who cares how they ’ re folded?
Septa Mordane,  Jon told her .  I don ’ t think she ’ d like Nymeria helping, either.  The she-wolf regarded him silently with her dark golden eyes .  It ’ s just as well . I have something for you to take with you, and it has to be packed very carefully.
Her face lit up .  A present?
You could call it that . Close the door.
Wary but excited, Arya checked the hall .  Nymeria, here . Guard.  She left the wolf out there to warn of intruders and closed the door . By then Jon had pulled off the rags he ’ d wrapped it in . He held it out to her.
Arya ’ s eyes went wide . Dark eyes, like his .  A sword,  she said in a small, hushed breath.
The scabbard was soft grey leather, supple as sin . Jon drew out the blade slowly, so she could see the deep blue sheen of the steel .  This is no toy,  he told her .  Be careful you don ’ t cut yourself . The edges are sharp enough to shave with.
Girls don ’ t shave,  Arya said.
Maybe they should . Have you ever seen the septa ’ s legs?
She giggled at him .  It ’ s so skinny.
Jon told her . [BOS] So are you, I had Mikken make this special . The bravos use swords like this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities . It won ’ t hack a man ’ s head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you ’ re fast enough . [EOS]
I can be fast,  Arya said.
You ’ ll have to work at it every day.  He put the sword in her hands, showed her how to hold it, and stepped back .  How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
I think so,  Arya said.
Jon said . [BOS] First lesson, Stick them with the pointy end . [EOS]
Arya gave him a whap on the arm with the flat of her blade . The blow stung, but Jon found himself grinning like an idiot .  I know which end to use,  Arya said . A doubtful look crossed her face .  Septa Mordane will take it away from me.
Jon said . [BOS] Not if she doesn ’ t know you have it, [EOS]
Who will I practice with?
Jon promised her . [BOS] You ’ ll find someone, King ’ s Landing is a true city, a thousand times the size of Winterfell . Until you find a partner, watch how they fight in the yard . Run, and ride, make yourself strong . And whatever you do … [EOS]
Arya knew what was coming next . They said it together.
… don ’ t … tell … Sansa!
Jon messed up her hair . [BOS] I will miss you, little sister . [EOS]
Suddenly she looked like she was going to cry .  I wish you were coming with us.
Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle . Who knows?  He was feeling better now . He was not going to let himself be sad .  I better go . I ’ ll spend my first year on the Wall emptying chamber pots if I keep Uncle Ben waiting any longer.
Arya ran to him for a last hug . Jon warned her, laughing . She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses . [BOS] Put down the sword first, [EOS]
When he turned back at the door, she was holding it again, trying it for balance .  I almost forgot,  he told her .  All the best swords have names.
Like Ice,  she said . She looked at the blade in her hand .  Does this have a name? Oh, tell me.
Jon teased . [BOS] Can ’ t you guess? Your very favorite thing . [EOS]
Arya seemed puzzled at first . Then it came to her . She was that quick . They said it together:
The memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north.
The courtyard rang to the song of swords.
Under black wool, boiled leather, and mail, sweat trickled icily down Jon ’ s chest as he pressed the attack . Grenn stumbled backward, defending himself clumsily . When he raised his sword, Jon went underneath it with a sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boy ’ s leg and sent him staggering . Grenn ’ s downcut was answered by an overhand that dented his helm . When he tried a sideswing, Jon swept aside his blade and slammed a mailed forearm into his chest . Grenn lost his footing and sat down hard in the snow . Jon knocked his sword from his fingers with a slash to his wrist that brought a cry of pain.
Enough!  Ser Alliser Thorne had a voice with an edge like Valyrian steel.
Grenn cradled his hand .  The bastard broke my wrist.
The bastard hamstrung you, opened your empty skull, and cut off your hand . Or would have, if these blades had an edge . It ’ s fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers.  Ser Alliser gestured at Jeren and Toad .  Get the Aurochs on his feet, he has funeral arrangements to make.
Jon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling Grenn to his feet . The frosty morning air felt good on his face . He leaned on his sword, drew a deep breath, and allowed himself a moment to savor the victory.
That is a longsword, not an old man ’ s cane,  Ser Alliser said sharply .  Are your legs hurting, Lord Snow?
Jon hated that name, a mockery that Ser Alliser had hung on him the first day he came to practice . The boys had picked it up, and now he heard it everywhere . He slid the longsword back into its scabbard . [BOS] No, [EOS] he replied.
Thorne strode toward him, crisp black leathers whispering faintly as he moved . He was a compact man of fifty years, spare and hard, with grey in his black hair and eyes like chips of onyx .  The truth now,  he commanded.
Jon admitted . His arm burned from the weight of the longsword, and he was starting to feel his bruises now that the fight was done . [BOS] I ’ m tired, [EOS]
What you are is weak.
I won.
No . The Aurochs lost.
One of the other boys sniggered . Jon knew better than to reply . He had beaten everyone that Ser Alliser had sent against him, yet it gained him nothing . The master-at-arms served up only derision . Thorne hated him, Jon had decided; of course, he hated the other boys even worse.
That will be all,  Thorne told them .  I can only stomach so much ineptitude in any one day . If the Others ever come for us, I pray they have archers, because you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder.
Jon followed the rest back to the armory, walking alone . He often walked alone here . There were almost twenty in the group he trained with, yet not one he could call a friend . Most were two or three years his senior, yet not one was half the fighter Robb had been at fourteen . Dareon was quick but afraid of being hit . Pyp used his sword like a dagger, Jeren was weak as a girl, Grenn slow and clumsy . Halder ’ s blows were brutally hard but he ran right into your attacks . The more time he spent with them, the more Jon despised them.
Inside, Jon hung sword and scabbard from a hook in the stone wall, ignoring the others around him . Methodically, he began to strip off his mail, leather, and sweat-soaked woolens . Chunks of coal burned in iron braziers at either end of the long room, but Jon found himself shivering . The chill was always with him here . In a few years he would forget what it felt like to be warm.
The weariness came on him suddenly, as he donned the roughspun blacks that were their everyday wear . He sat on a bench, his fingers fumbling with the fastenings on his cloak . So cold, he thought, remembering the warm halls of Winterfell, where the hot waters ran through the walls like blood through a man ’ s body . There was scant warmth to be found in Castle Black; the walls were cold here, and the people colder.
No one had told him the Night ’ s Watch would be like this; no one except Tyrion Lannister . The dwarf had given him the truth on the road north, but by then it had been too late . Jon wondered if his father had known what the Wall would be like . He must have, he thought; that only made it hurt the worse.
Even his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world . Up here, the genial Benjen Stark he had known became a different person . He was First Ranger, and he spent his days and nights with Lord Commander Mormont and Maester Aemon and the other high officers, while Jon was given over to the less than tender charge of Ser Alliser Thorne.
Three days after their arrival, Jon had heard that Benjen Stark was to lead a half-dozen men on a ranging into the haunted forest . That night he sought out his uncle in the great timbered common hall and pleaded to go with him . Benjen refused him curtly .  This is not Winterfell,  he told him as he cut his meat with fork and dagger .  On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns . You ’ re no ranger, Jon, only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you.
Stupidly, Jon argued .  I ’ ll be fifteen on my name day,  he said .  Almost a man grown.
Benjen Stark frowned .  A boy you are, and a boy you ’ ll remain until Ser Alliser says you are fit to be a man of the Night ’ s Watch . If you thought your Stark blood would win you easy favors, you were wrong . We put aside our old families when we swear our vows . Your father will always have a place in my heart, but these are my brothers now.  He gestured with his dagger at the men around them, all the hard cold men in black.
Jon rose at dawn the next day to watch his uncle leave . One of his rangers, a big ugly man, sang a bawdy song as he saddled his garron, his breath steaming in the cold morning air . Ben Stark smiled at that, but he had no smile for his nephew . [BOS] How often must I tell you no, Jon? We ’ ll speak when I return . [EOS]
As he watched his uncle lead his horse into the tunnel, Jon had remembered the things that Tyrion Lannister told him on the kingsroad, and in his mind ’ s eye he saw Ben Stark lying dead, his blood red on the snow . The thought made him sick . What was he becoming? Afterward he sought out Ghost in the loneliness of his cell, and buried his face in his thick white fur.
If he must be alone, he would make solitude his armor . Castle Black had no godswood, only a small sept and a drunken septon, but Jon could not find it in him to pray to any gods, old or new . If they were real, he thought, they were as cruel and implacable as winter.
He missed his true brothers: little Rickon, bright eyes shining as he begged for a sweet; Robb, his rival and best friend and constant companion; Bran, stubborn and curious, always wanting to follow and join in whatever Jon and Robb were doing . He missed the girls too, even Sansa, who never called him anything but  my half brother  since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant . And Arya … he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes, so fierce and willful . Arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had … yet she could always make Jon smile . He would give anything to be with her now, to muss up her hair once more and watch her make a face, to hear her finish a sentence with him.
You broke my wrist, bastard boy.
Jon lifted his eyes at the sullen voice . Grenn loomed over him, thick of neck and red of face, with three of his friends behind him . He knew Todder, a short ugly boy with an unpleasant voice . The recruits all called him Toad . The other two were the ones Yoren had brought north with them, Jon remembered, rapers taken down in the Fingers . He ’ d forgotten their names . He hardly ever spoke to them, if he could help it . They were brutes and bullies, without a thimble of honor between them.
Jon stood up . [BOS] I ’ ll break the other one for you if you ask nicely. [EOS] Grenn was sixteen and a head taller than Jon . All four of them were bigger than he was, but they did not scare him . He ’ d beaten every one of them in the yard.
Maybe we ’ ll break you,  one of the rapers said.
Jon reached back for his sword, but one of them grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back . [BOS] Try. [EOS]
You make us look bad,  complained Toad.
Jon told him . The boy who had his arm jerked upward on him, hard . Pain lanced through him, but Jon would not cry out . [BOS] You looked bad before I ever met you, [EOS]
Toad stepped close .  The little lordling has a mouth on him,  he said . He had pig eyes, small and shiny .  Is that your mommy ’ s mouth, bastard? What was she, some whore? Tell us her name . Maybe I had her a time or two.  He laughed.
Jon twisted like an eel and slammed a heel down across the instep of the boy holding him . There was a sudden cry of pain, and he was free . He flew at Toad, knocked him backward over a bench, and landed on his chest with both hands on his throat, slamming his head against the packed earth.
The two from the Fingers pulled him off, throwing him roughly to the ground . Grenn began to kick at him . Jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming voice cut through the gloom of the armory .  STOP THIS! NOW!
Jon pulled himself to his feet . Donal Noye stood glowering at them .  The yard is for fighting,  the armorer said .  Keep your quarrels out of my armory, or I ’ ll make them my quarrels . You won ’ t like that.
Toad sat on the floor, gingerly feeling the back of his head . His fingers came away bloody .  He tried to kill me.
’ S true . I saw it,  one of the rapers put in.
He broke my wrist,  Grenn said again, holding it out to Noye for inspection.
The armorer gave the offered wrist the briefest of glances .  A bruise . Perhaps a sprain . Maestor Aemon will give you a salve . Go with him, Todder, that head wants looking after . The rest of you, return to your cells . Not you, Snow . You stay.
Jon sat heavily on the long wooden bench as the others left, oblivious to the looks they gave him, the silent promises of future retribution . His arm was throbbing.
The Watch has need of every man it can get,  Donal Noye said when they were alone .  Even men like Toad . You won ’ t win any honors killing him.
Jon ’ s anger flared . [BOS] He said my mother was— [EOS]
—a whore . I heard him . What of it?
Jon said icily . [BOS] Lord Eddard Stark was not a man to sleep with whores, His honor— [EOS]
—did not prevent him from fathering a bastard . Did it?
Jon was cold with rage . [BOS] Can I go? [EOS]
You go when I tell you to go.
Jon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier, until Noye took him under the chin, thick fingers twisting his head around . [BOS] Look at me when I ’ m talking to you, boy . [EOS]
Jon looked . The armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match . His nose was flat and broad, and he always seemed in need of a shave . The left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword . [BOS] Words won ’ t make your mother a whore . She was what she was, and nothing Toad says can change that . You know, we have men on the Wall whose mothers were whores . [EOS]
Not my mother, Jon thought stubbornly . He knew nothing of his mother; Eddard Stark would not talk of her . Yet he dreamed of her at times, so often that he could almost see her face . In his dreams, she was beautiful, and highborn, and her eyes were kind.
You think you had it hard, being a high lord ’ s bastard?  the armorer went on .  That boy Jeren is a septon ’ s get, and Cotter Pyke is the baseborn son of a tavern wench . Now he commands Eastwatch by the Sea.
Jon said . [BOS] I don ’ t care, I don ’ t care about them and I don ’ t care about you or Thorne or Benjen Stark or any of it . I hate it here . It ’ s too … it ’ s cold . [EOS]
Yes . Cold and hard and mean, that ’ s the Wall, and the men who walk it . Not like the stories your wet nurse told you . Well, piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse . This is the way it is, and you ’ re here for life, same as the rest of us.
Jon repeated bitterly . The armorer could talk about life . He ’ d had one . He ’ d only taken the black after he ’ d lost an arm at the siege of Storm ’ s End . Before that he ’ d smithed for Stannis Baratheon, the king ’ s brother . He ’ d seen the Seven Kingdoms from one end to the other; he ’ d feasted and wenched and fought in a hundred battles . They said it was Donal Noye who ’ d forged King Robert ’ s warhammer, the one that crushed the life from Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident . He ’ d done all the things that Jon would never do, and then when he was old, well past thirty, he ’ d taken a glancing blow from an axe and the wound had festered until the whole arm had to come off . Only then, crippled, had Donal Noye come to the Wall, when his life was all but over . [BOS] Life, [EOS]
Yes, life,  Noye said .  A long life or a short one, it ’ s up to you, Snow . The road you ’ re walking, one of your brothers will slit your throat for you one night.
Jon snapped . [BOS] They ’ re not my brothers, They hate me because I ’ m better than they are . [EOS]
No . They hate you because you act like you ’ re better than they are . They look at you and see a castle-bred bastard who thinks he ’ s a lordling.  The armorer leaned close .  You ’ re no lordling . Remember that . You ’ re a Snow, not a Stark . You ’ re a bastard and a bully.
A bully?  Jon almost choked on the word . The accusation was so unjust it took his breath away .  They were the ones who came after me . Four of them.
Four that you ’ ve humiliated in the yard . Four who are probably afraid of you . I ’ ve watched you fight . It ’ s not training with you . Put a good edge on your sword, and they ’ d be dead meat; you know it, I know it, they know it . You leave them nothing . You shame them . Does that make you proud?
Jon hesitated . He did feel proud when he won . Why shouldn ’ t he? But the armorer was taking that away too, making it sound as if he were doing something wrong . [BOS] They ’ re all older than me, [EOS] he said defensively.
Older and bigger and stronger, that ’ s the truth . I ’ ll wager your master-at-arms taught you how to fight bigger men at Winterfell, though . Who was he, some old knight?
Jon said warily . There was a trap here . He felt it closing around him . [BOS] Ser Rodrik Cassel, [EOS]
Donal Noye leaned forward, into Jon ’ s face .  Now think on this, boy . None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser . Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley . What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad . They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword.  His look was grim .  So how do you like the taste of your victories now, Lord Snow?
Jon said sharply, but the force had gone out of his anger . Suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty . [BOS] Don ’ t call me that! I never … I didn ’ t think … [EOS]
Best you start thinking,  Noye warned him .  That, or sleep with a dagger by your bed . Now go.
By the time Jon left the armory, it was almost midday . The sun had broken through the clouds . He turned his back on it and lifted his eyes to the Wall, blazing blue and crystalline in the sunlight . Even after all these weeks, the sight of it still gave him the shivers . Centuries of windblown dirt had pocked and scoured it, covering it like a film, and it often seemed a pale grey, the color of an overcast sky … but when the sun caught it fair on a bright day, it shone, alive with light, a colossal blue-white cliff that filled up half the sky.
The largest structure ever built by the hands of man, Benjen Stark had told Jon on the kingsroad when they had first caught sight of the Wall in the distance .  And beyond a doubt the most useless,  Tyrion Lannister had added with a grin, but even the Imp grew silent as they rode closer . You could see it from miles off, a pale blue line across the northern horizon, stretching away to the east and west and vanishing in the far distance, immense and unbroken . This is the end of the world, it seemed to say.
When they finally spied Castle Black, its timbered keeps and stone towers looked like nothing more than a handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow, beneath the vast wall of ice . The ancient stronghold of the black brothers was no Winterfell, no true castle at all . Lacking walls, it could not be defended, not from the south, or east, or west; but it was only the north that concerned the Night ’ s Watch, and to the north loomed the Wall . Almost seven hundred feet high it stood, three times the height of the tallest tower in the stronghold it sheltered . His uncle said the top was wide enough for a dozen armored knights to ride abreast . The gaunt outlines of huge catapults and monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry up there, like the skeletons of great birds, and among them walked men in black as small as ants.
As he stood outside the armory looking up, Jon felt almost as overwhelmed as he had that day on the kingsroad, when he ’ d seen it for the first time . The Wall was like that . Sometimes he could almost forget that it was there, the way you forgot about the sky or the earth underfoot, but there were other times when it seemed as if there was nothing else in the world . It was older than the Seven Kingdoms, and when he stood beneath it and looked up, it made Jon dizzy . He could feel the great weight of all that ice pressing down on him, as if it were about to topple, and somehow Jon knew that if it fell, the world fell with it.
Makes you wonder what lies beyond,  a familiar voice said.
Jon looked around . [BOS] Lannister . I didn ’ t see—I mean, I thought I was alone . [EOS]
Tyrion Lannister was bundled in furs so thickly he looked like a very small bear .  There ’ s much to be said for taking people unawares . You never know what you might learn.
Jon told him . He had seen little of the dwarf since their journey ended . As the queen ’ s own brother, Tyrion Lannister had been an honored guest of the Night ’ s Watch . The Lord Commander had given him rooms in the King ’ s Tower—so-called, though no king had visited it for a hundred years—and Lannister dined at Mormont ’ s own table and spent his days riding the Wall and his nights dicing and drinking with Ser Alliser and Bowen Marsh and the other high officers . [BOS] You won ’ t learn anything from me, [EOS]
Oh, I learn things everywhere I go.  The little man gestured up at the Wall with a gnarled black walking stick .  As I was saying … why is it that when one man builds a wall, the next man immediately needs to know what ’ s on the other side?  He cocked his head and looked at Jon with his curious mismatched eyes .  You do want to know what ’ s on the other side, don ’ t you?
Jon said . He wanted to ride with Benjen Stark on his rangings, deep into the mysteries of the haunted forest, wanted to fight Mance Rayder ’ s wildlings and ward the realm against the Others, but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted . [BOS] It ’ s nothing special, The rangers say it ’ s just woods and mountains and frozen lakes, with lots of snow and ice . [EOS]
And the grumkins and the snarks,  Tyrion said .  Let us not forget them, Lord Snow, or else what ’ s that big thing for?
Don ’ t call me Lord Snow.
The dwarf lifted an eyebrow .  Would you rather be called the Imp? Let them see that their words can cut you, and you ’ ll never be free of the mockery . If they want to give you a name, take it, make it your own . Then they can ’ t hurt you with it anymore.  He gestured with his stick .  Come, walk with me . They ’ ll be serving some vile stew in the common hall by now, and I could do with a bowl of something hot.
Jon was hungry too, so he fell in beside Lannister and slowed his pace to match the dwarf ’ s awkward, waddling steps . The wind was rising, and they could hear the old wooden buildings creaking around them, and in the distance a heavy shutter banging, over and over, forgotten . Once there was a muffled thump as a blanket of snow slid from a roof and landed near them.
I don ’ t see your wolf,  Lannister said as they walked.
I chain him up in the old stables when we ’ re training . They board all the horses in the east stables now, so no one bothers him . The rest of the time he stays with me . My sleeping cell is in Hardin ’ s Tower.
That ’ s the one with the broken battlement, no? Shattered stone in the yard below, and a lean to it like our noble king Robert after a long night ’ s drinking? I thought all those buildings had been abandoned.
Jon shrugged . [BOS] No one cares where you sleep . Most of the old keeps are empty, you can pick any cell you want. [EOS] Once Castle Black had housed five thousand fighting men with all their horses and servants and weapons . Now it was home to a tenth that number, and parts of it were falling into ruin.
Tyrion Lannister ’ s laughter steamed in the cold air .  I ’ ll be sure to tell your father to arrest more stonemasons, before your tower collapses.
Jon could taste the mockery there, but there was no denying the truth . The Watch had built nineteen great strongholds along the Wall, but only three were still occupied: Eastwatch on its grey windswept shore, the Shadow Tower hard by the mountains where the Wall ended, and Castle Black between them, at the end of the kingsroad . The other keeps, long deserted, were lonely, haunted places, where cold winds whistled through black windows and the spirits of the dead manned the parapets.
Jon said stubbornly . [BOS] It ’ s better that I ’ m by myself, The rest of them are scared of Ghost . [EOS]
Wise boys,  Lannister said . Then he changed the subject .  The talk is, your uncle is too long away.
Jon remembered the wish he ’ d wished in his anger, the vision of Benjen Stark dead in the snow, and he looked away quickly . The dwarf had a way of sensing things, and Jon did not want him to see the guilt in his eyes .  He said he ’ d be back by my name day,  he admitted . His name day had come and gone, unremarked, a fortnight past .  They were looking for Ser Waymar Royce, his father is bannerman to Lord Arryn . Uncle Benjen said they might search as far as the Shadow Tower . That ’ s all the way up in the mountains.
I hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late,  Lannister said as they mounted the steps to the common hall . He grinned and pulled open the door .  Perhaps the grumkins are hungry this year.
Inside, the hall was immense and drafty, even with a fire roaring in its great hearth . Crows nested in the timbers of its lofty ceiling . Jon heard their cries overhead as he accepted a bowl of stew and a heel of black bread from the day ’ s cooks . Grenn and Toad and some of the others were seated at the bench nearest the warmth, laughing and cursing each other in rough voices . Jon eyed them thoughtfully for a moment . Then he chose a spot at the far end of the hall, well away from the other diners.
Tyrion Lannister sat across from him, sniffing at the stew suspiciously .  Barley, onion, carrot,  he muttered .  Someone should tell the cooks that turnip isn ’ t a meat.
Jon pulled off his gloves and warmed his hands in the steam rising from the bowl . The smell made his mouth water . [BOS] It ’ s mutton stew. [EOS]
Jon knew Alliser Thorne ’ s voice, but there was a curious note in it that he had not heard before . He turned.
The Lord Commander wants to see you . Now.
For a moment Jon was too frightened to move . Why would the Lord Commander want to see him? They had heard something about Benjen, he thought wildly, he was dead, the vision had come true .  Is it my uncle?  he blurted .  Is he returned safe?
The Lord Commander is not accustomed to waiting,  was Ser Alliser ’ s reply .  And I am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards.
Tyrion Lannister swung off the bench and rose .  Stop it, Thorne . You ’ re frightening the boy.
Keep out of matters that don ’ t concern you, Lannister . You have no place here.
I have a place at court, though,  the dwarf said, smiling .  A word in the right ear, and you ’ ll die a sour old man before you get another boy to train . Now tell Snow why the Old Bear needs to see him . Is there news of his uncle?
No,  Ser Alliser said .  This is another matter entirely . A bird arrived this morning from Winterfell, with a message that concerns his brother.  He corrected himself .  His half brother.
Jon breathed, scrambling to his feet . [BOS] Bran, Something ’ s happened to Bran . [EOS]
Tyrion Lannister laid a hand on his arm .  Jon,  he said .  I am truly sorry.
Jon scarcely heard him . He brushed off Tyrion ’ s hand and strode across the hall . He was running by the time he hit the doors . He raced to the Commander ’ s Keep, dashing through drifts of old snow . When the guards passed him, he took the tower steps two at a time . By the time he burst into the presence of the Lord Commander, his boots were soaked and Jon was wild-eyed and panting .  Bran,  he said .  What does it say about Bran?
Jeor Mormont, Lord Commander of the Night ’ s Watch, was a gruff old man with an immense bald head and a shaggy grey beard . He had a raven on his arm, and he was feeding it kernels of corn .  I am told you can read.  He shook the raven off, and it flapped its wings and flew to the window, where it sat watching as Mormont drew a roll of paper from his belt and handed it to Jon .  Corn,  it muttered in a raucous voice .  Corn, corn.
Jon ’ s finger traced the outline of the direwolf in the white wax of the broken seal . He recognized Robb ’ s hand, but the letters seemed to blur and run as he tried to read them . He realized he was crying . And then, through the tears, he found the sense in the words, and raised his head .  He woke up,  he said .  The gods gave him back.
Crippled,  Mormont said .  I ’ m sorry, boy . Read the rest of the letter.
He looked at the words, but they didn ’ t matter . Nothing mattered . Bran was going to live .  My brother is going to live,  he told Mormont . The Lord Commander shook his head, gathered up a fistful of corn, and whistled . The raven flew to his shoulder, crying,  Live! Live!
Jon ran down the stairs, a smile on his face and Robb ’ s letter in his hand .  My brother is going to live,  he told the guards . They exchanged a look . He ran back to the common hall, where he found Tyrion Lannister just finishing his meal . He grabbed the little man under the arms, hoisted him up in the air, and spun him around in a circle .  Bran is going to live!  he whooped . Lannister looked startled . Jon put him down and thrust the paper into his hands .  Here, read it,  he said.
Others were gathering around and looking at him curiously . Jon noticed Grenn a few feet away . A thick woolen bandage was wrapped around one hand . He looked anxious and uncomfortable, not menacing at all . Jon went to him . Grenn edged backward and put up his hands .  Stay away from me now, you bastard.
Jon smiled at him . [BOS] I ’ m sorry about your wrist . Robb used the same move on me once, only with a wooden blade . It hurt like seven hells, but yours must be worse . Look, if you want, I can show you how to defend that . [EOS]
Alliser Thorne overheard him .  Lord Snow wants to take my place now.  He sneered .  I ’ d have an easier time teaching a wolf to juggle than you will training this aurochs.
Jon said . [BOS] I ’ ll take that wager, Ser Alliser, I ’ d love to see Ghost juggle . [EOS]
Jon heard Grenn suck in his breath, shocked . Silence fell.
Then Tyrion Lannister guffawed . Three of the black brothers joined in from a nearby table . The laughter spread up and down the benches, until even the cooks joined in . The birds stirred in the rafters, and finally even Grenn began to chuckle.
Ser Alliser never took his eyes from Jon . As the laughter rolled around him, his face darkened, and his sword hand curled into a fist .  That was a grievous error, Lord Snow,  he said at last in the acid tones of an enemy.
Jon was showing Dareon how best to deliver a sidestroke when the new recruit entered the practice yard .  Your feet should be farther apart,  he urged .  You don ’ t want to lose your balance . That ’ s good . Now pivot as you deliver the stroke, get all your weight behind the blade.
Dareon broke off and lifted his visor .  Seven gods,  he murmured .  Would you look at this, Jon.
Jon turned . Through the eye slit of his helm, he beheld the fattest boy he had ever seen standing in the door of the armory . By the look of him, he must have weighed twenty stone . The fur collar of his embroidered surcoat was lost beneath his chins . Pale eyes moved nervously in a great round moon of a face, and plump sweaty fingers wiped themselves on the velvet of his doublet . [BOS] They … they told me I was to come here for … for training, [EOS] he said to no one in particular.
A lordling,  Pyp observed to Jon .  Southron, most like near Highgarden.  Pyp had traveled the Seven Kingdoms with a mummers ’ troupe, and bragged that he could tell what you were and where you ’ d been born just from the sound of your voice.
A striding huntsman had been worked in scarlet thread upon the breast of the fat boy ’ s fur-trimmed surcoat . Jon did not recognize the sigil . Ser Alliser Thorne looked over his new charge and said,  It would seem they have run short of poachers and thieves down south . Now they send us pigs to man the Wall . Is fur and velvet your notion of armor, my Lord of Ham?
It was soon revealed that the new recruit had brought his own armor with him; padded doublet, boiled leather, mail and plate and helm, even a great wood-and-leather shield blazoned with the same striding huntsman he wore on his surcoat . As none of it was black, however, Ser Alliser insisted that he reequip himself from the armory . That took half the morning . His girth required Donal Noye to take apart a mail hauberk and refit it with leather panels at the sides . To get a helm over his head the armorer had to detach the visor . His leathers bound so tightly around his legs and under his arms that he could scarcely move . Dressed for battle, the new boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst its skin .  Let us hope you are not as inept as you look,  Ser Alliser said .  Halder, see what Ser Piggy can do.
Jon Snow winced . Halder had been born in a quarry and apprenticed as a stonemason . He was sixteen, tall and muscular, and his blows were as hard as any Jon had ever felt . [BOS] This will be uglier than a whore ’ s ass, [EOS] Pyp muttered, and it was.
The fight lasted less than a minute before the fat boy was on the ground, his whole body shaking as blood leaked through his shattered helm and between his pudgy fingers .  I yield,  he shrilled .  No more, I yield, don ’ t hit me.  Rast and some of the other boys were laughing.
Even then, Ser Alliser would not call an end .  On your feet, Ser Piggy,  he called .  Pick up your sword.  When the boy continued to cling to the ground, Thorne gestured to Halder .  Hit him with the flat of your blade until he finds his feet.  Halder delivered a tentative smack to his foe ’ s upraised cheeks .  You can hit harder than that,  Thorne taunted . Halder took hold of his longsword with both hands and brought it down so hard the blow split leather, even on the flat . The new boy screeched in pain.
Jon Snow took a step forward . Pyp laid a mailed hand on his arm . [BOS] Jon, no, [EOS] the small boy whispered with an anxious glance at Ser Alliser Thorne.
On your feet,  Thorne repeated . The fat boy struggled to rise, slipped, and fell heavily again .  Ser Piggy is starting to grasp the notion,  Ser Alliser observed .  Again.
Halder lifted the sword for another blow .  Cut us off a ham!  Rast urged, laughing.
Jon shook off Pyp ’ s hand . [BOS] Halder, enough . [EOS]
Halder looked to Ser Alliser.
The Bastard speaks and the peasants tremble,  the master-at-arms said in that sharp, cold voice of his .  I remind you that I am the master-at-arms here, Lord Snow.
Jon urged, ignoring Thorne as best he could . [BOS] Look at him, Halder, There ’ s no honor in beating a fallen foe . He yielded. [EOS] He knelt beside the fat boy.
Halder lowered his sword .  He yielded,  he echoed.
Ser Alliser ’ s onyx eyes were fixed on Jon Snow .  It would seem our Bastard is in love,  he said as Jon helped the fat boy to his feet .  Show me your steel, Lord Snow.
Jon drew his longsword . He dared defy Ser Alliser only to a point, and he feared he was well beyond it now.
Thorne smiled .  The Bastard wishes to defend his lady love, so we shall make an exercise of it . Rat, Pimple, help our Stone Head here.  Rast and Albett moved to join Halder .  Three of you ought to be sufficient to make Lady Piggy squeal . All you need do is get past the Bastard.
Jon said to the fat boy . Ser Alliser had often sent two foes against him, but never three . He knew he would likely go to sleep bruised and bloody tonight . He braced himself for the assault . [BOS] Stay behind me, [EOS]
Suddenly Pyp was beside him .  Three to two will make for better sport,  the small boy said cheerfully . He dropped his visor and slid out his sword . Before Jon could even think to protest, Grenn had stepped up to make a third.
The yard had grown deathly quiet . Jon could feel Ser Alliser ’ s eyes .  Why are you waiting?  he asked Rast and the others in a voice gone deceptively soft, but it was Jon who moved first . Halder barely got his sword up in time.
Jon drove him backward, attacking with every blow, keeping the older boy on the heels . Know your foe, Ser Rodrik had taught him once; Jon knew Halder, brutally strong but short of patience, with no taste for defense . Frustrate him, and he would leave himself open, as certain as sunset.
The clang of steel echoed through the yard as the others joined battle around him . Jon blocked a savage cut at his head, the shock of impact running up his arm as the swords crashed together . He slammed a sidestroke into Halder ’ s ribs, and was rewarded with a muffled grunt of pain . The counterstroke caught Jon on the shoulder . Chainmail crunched, and pain flared up his neck, but for an instant Halder was unbalanced . Jon cut his left leg from under him, and he fell with a curse and a crash.
Grenn was standing his ground as Jon had taught him, giving Albett more than he cared for, but Pyp was hard-pressed . Rast had two years and forty pounds on him . Jon stepped up behind him and rang the raper ’ s helm like a bell . As Rast went reeling, Pyp slid in under his guard, knocked him down, and leveled a blade at his throat . By then Jon had moved on . Facing two swords, Albett backed away .  I yield,  he shouted.
Ser Alliser Thorne surveyed the scene with disgust .  The mummer ’ s farce has gone on long enough for today.  He walked away . The session was at an end.
Dareon helped Halder to his feet . The quarryman ’ s son wrenched off his helm and threw it across the yard .  For an instant, I thought I finally had you, Snow.
Jon replied . Under his mail and leather, his shoulder was throbbing . He sheathed his sword and tried to remove his helm, but when he raised his arm, the pain made him grit his teeth . [BOS] For an instant, you did, [EOS]
Let me,  a voice said . Thick-fingered hands unfastened helm from gorget and lifted it off gently .  Did he hurt you?
I ’ ve been bruised before.  He touched his shoulder and winced . The yard was emptying around them.
Blood matted the fat boy ’ s hair where Halder had split his helm asunder .  My name is Samwell Tarly, of Horn …  He stopped and licked his lips .  I mean, I was of Horn Hill, until I … left . I ’ ve come to take the black . My father is Lord Randyll, a bannerman to the Tyrells of Highgarden . I used to be his heir, only …  His voice trailed off.
I ’ m Jon Snow, Ned Stark ’ s bastard, of Winterfell.
Samwell Tarly nodded .  I … if you want, you can call me Sam . My mother calls me Sam.
You can call him Lord Snow,  Pyp said as he came up to join them .  You don ’ t want to know what his mother calls him.
Jon said . [BOS] These two are Grenn and Pypar, [EOS]
Grenn ’ s the ugly one,  Pyp said.
Grenn scowled .  You ’ re uglier than me . At least I don ’ t have ears like a bat.
My thanks to all of you,  the fat boy said gravely.
Why didn ’ t you get up and fight?  Grenn demanded.
I wanted to, truly . I just … I couldn ’ t . I didn ’ t want him to hit me anymore.  He looked at the ground .  I … I fear I ’ m a coward . My lord father always said so.
Grenn looked thunderstruck . Even Pyp had no words to say to that, and Pyp had words for everything . What sort of man would proclaim himself a coward?
Samwell Tarly must have read their thoughts on their faces . His eyes met Jon ’ s and darted away, quick as frightened animals .  I … I ’ m sorry,  he said .  I don ’ t mean to … to be like I am.  He walked heavily toward the armory.
Jon called after him .  You were hurt,  he said .  Tomorrow you ’ ll do better.
Sam looked mournfully back over one shoulder .  No I won ’ t,  he said, blinking back tears .  I never do better.
When he was gone, Grenn frowned .  Nobody likes cravens,  he said uncomfortably .  I wish we hadn ’ t helped him . What if they think we ’ re craven too?
You ’ re too stupid to be craven,  Pyp told him.
I am not,  Grenn said.
Yes you are . If a bear attacked you in the woods, you ’ d be too stupid to run away.
I would not,  Grenn insisted .  I ’ d run away faster than you.  He stopped suddenly, scowling when he saw Pyp ’ s grin and realized what he ’ d just said . His thick neck flushed a dark red . Jon left them there arguing as he returned to the armory, hung up his sword, and stripped off his battered armor.
Life at Castle Black followed certain patterns; the mornings were for swordplay, the afternoons for work . The black brothers set new recruits to many different tasks, to learn where their skills lay . Jon cherished the rare afternoons when he was sent out with Ghost ranging at his side to bring back game for the Lord Commander ’ s table, but for every day spent hunting, he gave a dozen to Donal Noye in the armory, spinning the whetstone while the one-armed smith sharpened axes grown dull from use, or pumping the bellows as Noye hammered out a new sword . Other times he ran messages, stood at guard, mucked out stables, fletched arrows, assisted Maester Aemon with his birds or Bowen Marsh with his counts and inventories.
That afternoon, the watch commander sent him to the winch cage with four barrels of fresh-crushed stone, to scatter gravel over the icy footpaths atop the Wall . It was lonely and boring work, even with Ghost along for company, but Jon found he did not mind . On a clear day you could see half the world from the top of the Wall, and the air was always cold and bracing . He could think here, and he found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly … and, oddly, of Tyrion Lannister . He wondered what Tyrion would have made of the fat boy . Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, the dwarf had told him, grinning . The world was full of cravens who pretended to be heroes; it took a queer sort of courage to admit to cowardice as Samwell Tarly had.
His sore shoulder made the work go slowly . It was late afternoon before Jon finished graveling the paths . He lingered on high to watch the sun go down, turning the western sky the color of blood . Finally, as dusk was settling over the north, Jon rolled the empty barrels back into the cage and signaled the winch men to lower him.
The evening meal was almost done by the time he and Ghost reached the common hall . A group of the black brothers were dicing over mulled wine near the fire . His friends were at the bench nearest the west wall, laughing . Pyp was in the middle of a story . The mummer ’ s boy with the big ears was a born liar with a hundred different voices, and he did not tell his tales so much as live them, playing all the parts as needed, a king one moment and a swineherd the next . When he turned into an alehouse girl or a virgin princess, he used a high falsetto voice that reduced them all to tears of helpless laughter, and his eunuchs were always eerily accurate caricatures of Ser Alliser . Jon took as much pleasure from Pyp ’ s antics as anyone … yet that night he turned away and went instead to the end of the bench, where Samwell Tarly sat alone, as far from the others as he could get.
He was finishing the last of the pork pie the cooks had served up for supper when Jon sat down across from him . The fat boy ’ s eyes widened at the sight of Ghost .  Is that a wolf?
Jon said . [BOS] A direwolf, His name is Ghost . The direwolf is the sigil of my father ’ s House . [EOS]
Ours is a striding huntsman,  Samwell Tarly said.
Do you like to hunt?
The fat boy shuddered .  I hate it.  He looked as though he was going to cry again.
Jon asked him . [BOS] What ’ s wrong now? Why are you always so frightened? [EOS]
Sam stared at the last of his pork pie and gave a feeble shake of his head, too scared even to talk . A burst of laughter filled the hall . Jon heard Pyp squeaking in a high voice . He stood .  Let ’ s go outside.
The round fat face looked up at him, suspicious .  Why? What will we do outside?
Jon said . [BOS] Talk, Have you seen the Wall? [EOS]
I ’ m fat, not blind,  Samwell Tarly said .  Of course I saw it, it ’ s seven hundred feet high.  Yet he stood up all the same, wrapped a fur-lined cloak over his shoulders, and followed Jon from the common hall, still wary, as if he suspected some cruel trick was waiting for him in the night . Ghost padded along beside them .  I never thought it would be like this,  Sam said as they walked, his words steaming in the cold air . Already he was huffing and puffing as he tried to keep up .  All the buildings are falling down, and it ’ s so … so …
Cold?  A hard frost was settling over the castle, and Jon could hear the soft crunch of grey weeds beneath his boots.
Sam nodded miserably .  I hate the cold,  he said .  Last night I woke up in the dark and the fire had gone out and I was certain I was going to freeze to death by morning.
It must have been warmer where you come from.
I never saw snow until last month . We were crossing the barrowlands, me and the men my father sent to see me north, and this white stuff began to fall, like a soft rain . At first I thought it was so beautiful, like feathers drifting from the sky, but it kept on and on, until I was frozen to the bone . The men had crusts of snow in their beards and more on their shoulders, and still it kept coming . I was afraid it would never end.
Jon smiled.
The Wall loomed before them, glimmering palely in the light of the half moon . In the sky above, the stars burned clear and sharp .  Are they going to make me go up there?  Sam asked . His face curdled like old milk as he looked at the great wooden stairs .  I ’ ll die if I have to climb that.
Jon said, pointing . [BOS] There ’ s a winch, They can draw you up in a cage . [EOS]
Samwell Tarly sniffled .  I don ’ t like high places.
It was too much . Jon frowned, incredulous .  Are you afraid of everything?  he asked .  I don ’ t understand . If you are truly so craven, why are you here? Why would a coward want to join the Night ’ s Watch?
Samwell Tarly looked at him for a long moment, and his round face seemed to cave in on itself . He sat down on the frost-covered ground and began to cry, huge choking sobs that made his whole body shake . Jon Snow could only stand and watch . Like the snowfall on the barrowlands, it seemed the tears would never end.
It was Ghost who knew what to do . Silent as shadow, the pale direwolf moved closer and began to lick the warm tears off Samwell Tarly ’ s face . The fat boy cried out, startled … and somehow, in a heartbeat, his sobs turned to laughter.
Jon Snow laughed with him . Afterward they sat on the frozen ground, huddled in their cloaks with Ghost between them . Jon told the story of how he and Robb had found the pups newborn in the late summer snows . It seemed a thousand years ago now . Before long he found himself talking of Winterfell.
Sometimes I dream about it,  he said .  I ’ m walking down this long empty hall . My voice echoes all around, but no one answers, so I walk faster, opening doors, shouting names . I don ’ t even know who I ’ m looking for . Most nights it ’ s my father, but sometimes it ’ s Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my uncle.  The thought of Benjen Stark saddened him; his uncle was still missing . The Old Bear had sent out rangers in search of him . Ser Jaremy Rykker had led two sweeps, and Quorin Halfhand had gone forth from the Shadow Tower, but they ’ d found nothing aside from a few blazes in the trees that his uncle had left to mark his way . In the stony highlands to the northwest, the marks stopped abruptly and all trace of Ben Stark vanished.
Do you ever find anyone in your dream?  Sam asked.
Jon shook his head .  No one . The castle is always empty.  He had never told anyone of the dream, and he did not understand why he was telling Sam now, yet somehow it felt good to talk of it .  Even the ravens are gone from the rookery, and the stables are full of bones . That always scares me . I start to run then, throwing open doors, climbing the tower three steps at a time, screaming for someone, for anyone . And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts . It ’ s black inside, and I can see the steps spiraling down . Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I don ’ t want to . I ’ m afraid of what might be waiting for me . The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps, but it ’ s not them I ’ m afraid of . I scream that I ’ m not a Stark, that this isn ’ t my place, but it ’ s no good, I have to go anyway, so I start down, feeling the walls as I descend, with no torch to light the way . It gets darker and darker, until I want to scream.  He stopped, frowning, embarrassed .  That ’ s when I always wake.  His skin cold and clammy, shivering in the darkness of his cell . Ghost would leap up beside him, his warmth as comforting as daybreak . He would go back to sleep with his face pressed into the direwolf ’ s shaggy white fur .  Do you dream of Horn Hill?  Jon asked.
No.  Sam ’ s mouth grew tight and hard .  I hated it there.  He scratched Ghost behind the ear, brooding, and Jon let the silence breathe . After a long while Samwell Tarly began to talk, and Jon Snow listened quietly, and learned how it was that a self-confessed coward found himself on the Wall.
The Tarlys were a family old in honor, bannermen to Mace Tyrell, Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South . The eldest son of Lord Randyll Tarly, Samwell was born heir to rich lands, a strong keep, and a storied two-handed greatsword named Heartsbane, forged of Valyrian steel and passed down from father to son near five hundred years.
Whatever pride his lord father might have felt at Samwell ’ s birth vanished as the boy grew up plump, soft, and awkward . Sam loved to listen to music and make his own songs, to wear soft velvets, to play in the castle kitchen beside the cooks, drinking in the rich smells as he snitched lemon cakes and blueberry tarts . His passions were books and kittens and dancing, clumsy as he was . But he grew ill at the sight of blood, and wept to see even a chicken slaughtered . A dozen masters-at-arms came and went at Horn Hill, trying to turn Samwell into the knight his father wanted . The boy was cursed and caned, slapped and starved . One man had him sleep in his chainmail to make him more martial . Another dressed him in his mother ’ s clothing and paraded him through the bailey to shame him into valor . He only grew fatter and more frightened, until Lord Randyll ’ s disappointment turned to anger and then to loathing .  One time,  Sam confided, his voice dropping from a whisper,  two men came to the castle, warlocks from Qarth with white skin and blue lips . They slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood, but it didn ’ t make me brave as they ’ d promised . I got sick and retched . Father had them scourged.
Finally, after three girls in as many years, Lady Tarly gave her lord husband a second son . From that day, Lord Randyll ignored Sam, devoting all his time to the younger boy, a fierce, robust child more to his liking . Samwell had known several years of sweet peace with his music and his books.
Until the dawn of his fifteenth name day, when he had been awakened to find his horse saddled and ready . Three men-at-arms had escorted him into a wood near Horn Hill, where his father was skinning a deer .  You are almost a man grown now, and my heir,  Lord Randyll Tarly had told his eldest son, his long knife laying bare the carcass as he spoke .  You have given me no cause to disown you, but neither will I allow you to inherit the land and title that should be Dickon ’ s . Heartsbane must go to a man strong enough to wield her, and you are not worthy to touch her hilt . So I have decided that you shall this day announce that you wish to take the black . You will forsake all claim to your brother ’ s inheritance and start north before evenfall.
If you do not, then on the morrow we shall have a hunt, and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble, and you will be thrown from the saddle to die … or so I will tell your mother . She has a woman ’ s heart and finds it in her to cherish even you, and I have no wish to cause her pain . Please do not imagine that it will truly be that easy, should you think to defy me . Nothing would please me more than to hunt you down like the pig you are.  His arms were red to the elbow as he laid the skinning knife aside .  So . There is your choice . The Night ’ s Watch  —he reached inside the deer, ripped out its heart, and held it in his fist, red and dripping—  or this.
Sam told the tale in a calm, dead voice, as if it were something that had happened to someone else, not to him . And strangely, Jon thought, he did not weep, not even once . When he was done, they sat together and listened to the wind for a time . There was no other sound in all the world.
Finally Jon said,  We should go back to the common hall.
Why?  Sam asked.
Jon shrugged . [BOS] There ’ s hot cider to drink, or mulled wine if you prefer . Some nights Dareon sings for us, if the mood is on him . He was a singer, before … well, not truly, but almost, an apprentice singer . [EOS]
How did he come here?  Sam asked.
Jon smiled . [BOS] Lord Rowan of Goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter . The girl was two years older, and Dareon swears she helped him through her window, but under her father ’ s eye she named it rape, so here he is . When Maester Aemon heard him sing, he said his voice was honey poured over thunder. Toad sometimes sings too, if you call it singing . Drinking songs he learned in his father ’ s winesink . Pyp says his voice is piss poured over a fart. [EOS] They laughed at that together.
I should like to hear them both,  Sam admitted,  but they would not want me there.  His face was troubled .  He ’ s going to make me fight again on the morrow, isn ’ t he?
He is,  Jon was forced to say.
Sam got awkwardly to his feet .  I had better try to sleep,  He huddled down in his cloak and plodded off.
The others were still in the common room when Jon returned, alone but for Ghost .  Where have you been?  Pyp asked.
Talking with Sam,  he said.
He truly is craven,  said Grenn .  At supper, there were still places on the bench when he got his pie, but he was too scared to come sit with us.
The Lord of Ham thinks he ’ s too good to eat with the likes of us,  suggested Jeren.
I saw him eat a pork pie,  Toad said, smirking .  Do you think it was a brother?  He began to make oinking noises.
Jon snapped angrily . [BOS] Stop it! [EOS]
The other boys fell silent, taken aback by his sudden fury . Jon said into the quiet, and he told them how it was going to be . Pyp backed him, as he ’ d known he would, but when Halder spoke up, it was a pleasant surprise . Grenn was anxious at the first, but Jon knew the words to move him . One by one the rest fell in line . Jon persuaded some, cajoled some, shamed the others, made threats where threats were required . At the end they had all agreed … all but Rast . [BOS] Listen to me, [EOS]
You girls do as you please,  Rast said,  but if Thorne sends me against Lady Piggy, I ’ m going to slice me off a rasher of bacon.  He laughed in Jon ’ s face and left them there.
Hours later, as the castle slept, three of them paid a call on his cell . Grenn held his arms while Pyp sat on his legs . Jon could hear Rast ’ s rapid breathing as Ghost leapt onto his chest . The direwolf ’ s eyes burned red as embers as his teeth nipped lightly at the soft skin of the boy ’ s throat, just enough to draw blood . Jon said softly . [BOS] Remember, we know where you sleep, [EOS]
The next morning Jon heard Rast tell Albett and Toad how his razor had slipped while he shaved.
From that day forth, neither Rast nor any of the others would hurt Samwell Tarly . When Ser Alliser matched them against him, they would stand their ground and swat aside his slow, clumsy strokes . If the master-at-arms screamed for an attack, they would dance in and tap Sam lightly on breastplate or helm or leg . Ser Alliser raged and threatened and called them all cravens and women and worse, yet Sam remained unhurt . A few nights later, at Jon ’ s urging, he joined them for the evening meal, taking a place on the bench beside Halder . It was another fortnight before he found the nerve to join their talk, but in time he was laughing at Pyp ’ s faces and teasing Grenn with the best of them.
Fat and awkward and frightened he might be, but Samwell Tarly was no fool . One night he visited Jon in his cell .  I don ’ t know what you did,  he said,  but I know you did it.  He looked away shyly .  I ’ ve never had a friend before.
Jon said . He put a hand on Sam ’ s broad shoulder . [BOS] We ’ re not friends, We ’ re brothers . [EOS]
And so they were, he thought to himself after Sam had taken his leave . Robb and Bran and Rickon were his father ’ s sons, and he loved them still, yet Jon knew that he had never truly been one of them . Catelyn Stark had seen to that . The grey walls of Winterfell might still haunt his dreams, but Castle Black was his life now, and his brothers were Sam and Grenn and Halder and Pyp and the other cast-outs who wore the black of the Night ’ s Watch.
My uncle spoke truly,  he whispered to Ghost . He wondered if he would ever see Benjen Stark again, to tell him.
You are as hopeless as any boys I have ever trained,  Ser Alliser Thorne announced when they had all assembled in the yard .  Your hands were made for manure shovels, not for swords, and if it were up to me, the lot of you would be set to herding swine . But last night I was told that Gueren is marching five new boys up the kingsroad . One or two may even be worth the price of piss . To make room for them, I have decided to pass eight of you on to the Lord Commander to do with as he will.  He called out the names one by one .  Toad . Stone Head . Aurochs . Lover . Pimple . Monkey . Ser Loon.  Last, he looked at Jon .  And the Bastard.
Pyp let fly a whoop and thrust his sword into the air . Ser Alliser fixed him with a reptile stare .  They will call you men of Night ’ s Watch now, but you are bigger fools than the Mummer ’ s Monkey here if you believe that . You are boys still, green and stinking of summer, and when the winter comes you will die like flies.  And with that, Ser Alliser Thorne took his leave of them.
The other boys gathered round the eight who had been named, laughing and cursing and offering congratulations . Halder smacked Toad on the butt with the flat of his sword and shouted,  Toad, of the Night ’ s Watch!  Yelling that a black brother needed a horse, Pyp leapt onto Grenn ’ s shoulders, and they tumbled to the ground, rolling and punching and hooting . Dareon dashed inside the armory and returned with a skin of sour red . As they passed the wine from hand to hand, grinning like fools, Jon noticed Samwell Tarly standing by himself beneath a bare dead tree in the corner of the yard . Jon offered him the skin .  A swallow of wine?
Sam shook his head .  No thank you, Jon.
Are you well?
Very well, truly,  the fat boy lied .  I am so happy for you all.  His round face quivered as he forced a smile .  You will be First Ranger someday, just as your uncle was.
Jon corrected . He would not accept that Benjen Stark was dead . Before he could say more, Halder cried, [BOS] Is, Here, you planning to drink that all yourself? [EOS] Pyp snatched the skin from his hand and danced away, laughing . While Grenn seized his arm, Pyp gave the skin a squeeze, and a thin stream of red squirted Jon in the face . Halder howled in protest at the waste of good wine . Jon sputtered and struggled . Matthar and Jeren climbed the wall and began pelting them all with snowballs.
By the time he wrenched free, with snow in his hair and wine stains on his surcoat, Samwell Tarly had gone.
That night, Three-Finger Hobb cooked the boys a special meal to mark the occasion . When Jon arrived at the common hall, the Lord Steward himself led him to the bench near the fire . The older men clapped him on the arm in passing . The eight soon-to-be brothers feasted on rack of lamb baked in a crust of garlic and herbs, garnished with sprigs of mint, and surrounded by mashed yellow turnips swimming in butter .  From the Lord Commander ’ s own table,  Bowen Marsh told them . There were salads of spinach and chickpeas and turnip greens, and afterward bowls of iced blueberries and sweet cream.
Do you think they ’ ll keep us together?  Pyp wondered as they gorged themselves happily.
Toad made a face .  I hope not . I ’ m sick of looking at those ears of yours.
Ho,  said Pyp .  Listen to the crow call the raven black . You ’ re certain to be a ranger, Toad . They ’ ll want you as far from the castle as they can . If Mance Rayder attacks, lift your visor and show your face, and he ’ ll run off screaming.
Everyone laughed but Grenn .  I hope I ’ m a ranger.
You and everyone else,  said Matthar . Every man who wore the black walked the Wall, and every man was expected to take up steel in its defense, but the rangers were the true fighting heart of the Night ’ s Watch . It was they who dared ride beyond the Wall, sweeping through the haunted forest and the icy mountain heights west of the Shadow Tower, fighting Wildlings and giants and monstrous snow bears.
Not everyone,  said Halder .  It ’ s the builders for me . What use would rangers be if the Wall fell down?
The order of builders provided the masons and carpenters to repair keeps and towers, the miners to dig tunnels and crush stone for roads and footpaths, the woodsmen to clear away new growth wherever the forest pressed too close to the Wall . Once, it was said, they had quarried immense blocks of ice from frozen lakes deep in the haunted forest, dragging them south on sledges so the Wall might be raised ever higher . Those days were centuries gone, however; now, it was all they could do to ride the Wall from Eastwatch to the Shadow Tower, watching for cracks or signs of melt and making what repairs they could.
The Old Bear ’ s no fool,  Dareon observed .  You ’ re certain to be a builder, and Jon ’ s certain to be a ranger . He ’ s the best sword and the best rider among us, and his uncle was the First before he …  His voice trailed off awkwardly as he realized what he had almost said.
Benjen Stark is still First Ranger,  Jon Snow told him, toying with his bowl of blueberries . The rest might have given up all hope of his uncle ’ s safe return, but not him . He pushed away the berries, scarcely touched, and rose from the bench.
Aren ’ t you going to eat those?  Toad asked.
They ’ re yours.  Jon had hardly tasted Hobb ’ s great feast .  I could not eat another bite.  He took his cloak from its hook near the door and shouldered his way out.
Pyp followed him .  Jon, what is it?
Sam,  he admitted .  He was not at table tonight.
It ’ s not like him to miss a meal,  Pyp said thoughtfully .  Do you suppose he ’ s taken ill?
He ’ s frightened . We ’ re leaving him.  He remembered the day he had left Winterfell, all the bittersweet farewells; Bran lying broken, Robb with snow in his hair, Arya raining kisses on him after he ’ d given her Needle .  Once we say our words, we ’ ll all have duties to attend to . Some of us may be sent away, to Eastwatch or the Shadow Tower . Sam will remain in training, with the likes of Rast and Cuger and these new boys who are coming up the kingsroad . Gods only know what they ’ ll be like, but you can bet Ser Alliser will send them against him, first chance he gets.
Pyp made a grimace .  You did all you could.
Jon said . [BOS] All we could wasn ’ t enough, [EOS]
A deep restlessness was on him as he went back to Hardin ’ s Tower for Ghost . The direwolf walked beside him to the stables . Some of the more skittish horses kicked at their stalls and laid back their ears as they entered . Jon saddled his mare, mounted, and rode out from Castle Black, south across the moonlit night . Ghost raced ahead of him, flying over the ground, gone in the blink of an eye . Jon let him go . A wolf needed to hunt.
He had no destination in mind . He wanted only to ride . He followed the creek for a time, listening to the icy trickle of water over rock, then cut across the fields to the kingsroad . It stretched out before him, narrow and stony and pocked with weeds, a road of no particular promise, yet the sight of it filled Jon Snow with a vast longing . Winterfell was down that road, and beyond it Riverrun and King ’ s Landing and the Eyrie and so many other places; Casterly Rock, the Isles of Faces, the red mountains of Dorne, the hundred islands of Braavos in the sea, the smoking ruins of old Valyria . All the places that Jon would never see . The world was down that road … and he was here.
Once he swore his vow, the Wall would be his home until he was old as Maester Aemon .  I have not sworn yet,  he muttered . He was no outlaw, bound to take the black or pay the penalty for his crimes . He had come here freely, and he might leave freely … until he said the words . He need only ride on, and he could leave it all behind . By the time the moon was full again, he would be back in Winterfell with his brothers.
Your half brothers, a voice inside reminded him . And Lady Stark, who will not welcome you . There was no place for him in Winterfell, no place in King ’ s Landing either . Even his own mother had not had a place for him . The thought of her made him sad . He wondered who she had been, what she had looked like, why his father had left her . Because she was a whore or an adulteress, fool . Something dark and dishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her?
Jon Snow turned away from the kingsroad to look behind him . The fires of Castle Black were hidden behind a hill, but the Wall was there, pale beneath the moon, vast and cold, running from horizon to horizon.
He wheeled his horse around and started for home.
Ghost returned as he crested a rise and saw the distant glow of lamplight from the Lord Commander ’ s Tower . The direwolf ’ s muzzle was red with blood as he trotted beside the horse . Jon found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly again on the ride back . By the time he reached the stables, he knew what he must do.
Maester Aemon ’ s apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery . Aged and frail, the maester shared his chambers with two of the younger stewards, who tended to his needs and helped him in his duties . The brothers joked that he had been given the two ugliest men in the Night ’ s Watch; being blind, he was spared having to look at them . Clydas was short, bald, and chinless, with small pink eyes like a mole . Chett had a wen on his neck the size of a pigeon ’ s egg, and a face red with boils and pimples . Perhaps that was why he always seemed so angry.
It was Chett who answered Jon ’ s knock . Jon told him . [BOS] I need to speak to Maester Aemon, [EOS]
The maester is abed, as you should be . Come back on the morrow and maybe he ’ ll see you.  He began to shut the door.
Jon jammed it open with his boot . [BOS] I need to speak to him now . The morning will be too late . [EOS]
Chett scowled .  The maester is not accustomed to being woken in the night . Do you know how old he is?
Jon said . [BOS] Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you, Give him my pardons . I would not disturb his rest if it were not important . [EOS]
And if I refuse?
Jon had his boot wedged solidly in the door . [BOS] I can stand here all night if I must . [EOS]
The black brother made a disgusted noise and opened the door to admit him .  Wait in the library . There ’ s wood . Start a fire . I won ’ t have the maester catching a chill on account of you.
Jon had the logs crackling merrily by the time Chett led in Maester Aemon . The old man was clad in his bed robe, but around his throat was the chain collar of his order . A maester did not remove it even to sleep . [BOS] The chair beside the fire would be pleasant, [EOS] he said when he felt the warmth on his face . When he was settled comfortably, Chett covered his legs with a fur and went to stand by the door.
I am sorry to have woken you, Maester,  Jon Snow said.
You did not wake me,  Maester Aemon replied .  I find I need less sleep as I grow older, and I am grown very old . I often spend half the night with ghosts, remembering times fifty years past as if they were yesterday . The mystery of a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion . So tell me, Jon Snow, why have you come calling at this strange hour?
To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night ’ s Watch.
This is no concern of Maester Aemon,  Chett complained.
Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser Alliser Thorne,  the maester said gently .  Only he may say when a boy is ready to swear his vow, as you surely know . Why then come to me?
Jon told him . [BOS] The Lord Commander listens to you, And the wounded and the sick of the Night ’ s Watch are in your charge . [EOS]
And is your friend Samwell wounded or sick?
Jon promised, [BOS] He will be, unless you help . [EOS]
He told them all of it, even the part where he ’ d set Ghost at Rast ’ s throat . Maester Aemon listened silently, blind eyes fixed on the fire, but Chett ’ s face darkened with each word . Jon finished . [BOS] Without us to keep him safe, Sam will have no chance, He ’ s hopeless with a sword . My sister Arya could tear him apart, and she ’ s not yet ten . If Ser Alliser makes him fight, it ’ s only a matter of time before he ’ s hurt or killed . [EOS]
Chett could stand no more .  I ’ ve seen this fat boy in the common hall,  he said .  He is a pig, and a hopeless craven as well, if what you say is true.
Maybe it is so,  Maester Aemon said .  Tell me, Chett, what would you have us do with such a boy?
Leave him where he is,  Chett said .  The Wall is no place for the weak . Let him train until he is ready, no matter how many years that takes . Ser Alliser shall make a man of him or kill him, as the gods will.
Jon said . He took a deep breath to gather his thoughts . [BOS] That ’ s stupid, I remember once I asked Maester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat . [EOS]
Maester Aemon touched his own collar lightly, his bony, wrinkled finger stroking the heavy metal links .  Go on.
Jon said, remembering . [BOS] He told me that a maester ’ s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve, I asked why each link was a different metal . A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes, I said . Maester Luwin laughed . A maester forges his chain with study, he told me . The different metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for healing, iron for warcraft . And he said there were other meanings as well . The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves, isn ’ t that so? Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links can ’ t make a chain . You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like . A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people . [EOS]
Maester Aemon smiled .  And so?
The Night ’ s Watch needs all sorts too . Why else have rangers and stewards and builders? Lord Randyll couldn ’ t make Sam a warrior, and Ser Alliser won ’ t either . You can ’ t hammer tin into iron, no matter how hard you beat it, but that doesn ’ t mean tin is useless . Why shouldn ’ t Sam be a steward?
Chett gave an angry scowl .  I ’ m a steward . You think it ’ s easy work, fit for cowards? The order of stewards keeps the Watch alive . We hunt and farm, tend the horses, milk the cows, gather firewood, cook the meals . Who do you think makes your clothing? Who brings up supplies from the south? The stewards.
Maester Aemon was gentler .  Is your friend a hunter?
He hates hunting,  Jon had to admit.
Can he plow a field?  the maester asked .  Can he drive a wagon or sail a ship? Could he butcher a cow?
Chett gave a nasty laugh .  I ’ ve seen what happens to soft lordlings when they ’ re put to work . Set them to churning butter and their hands blister and bleed . Give them an axe to split logs, and they cut off their own foot.
I know one thing Sam could do better than anyone.
Yes?  Maester Aemon prompted.
Jon glanced warily at Chett, standing beside the door, his boils red and angry .  He could help you,  he said quickly .  He can do sums, and he knows how to read and write . I know Chett can ’ t read, and Clydas has weak eyes . Sam read every book in his father ’ s library . He ’ d be good with the ravens too . Animals seem to like him . Ghost took to him straight off . There ’ s a lot he could do, besides fighting . The Night ’ s Watch needs every man . Why kill one, to no end? Make use of him instead.
Maester Aemon closed his eyes, and for a brief moment Jon was afraid that he had gone to sleep . Finally he said,  Maester Luwin taught you well, Jon Snow . Your mind is as deft as your blade, it would seem.
Does that mean …?
It means I shall think on what you have said,  the maester told him firmly .  And now, I believe I am ready to sleep . Chett, show our young brother to the door.
Jon was breaking his fast on applecakes and blood sausage when Samwell Tarly plopped himself down on the bench .  I ’ ve been summoned to the sept,  Sam said in an excited whisper .  They ’ re passing me out of training . I ’ m to be made a brother with the rest of you . Can you believe it?
No, truly?
Truly . I ’ m to assist Maester Aemon with the library and the birds . He needs someone who can read and write letters.
Jon said, smiling . [BOS] You ’ ll do well at that, [EOS]
Sam glanced about anxiously .  Is it time to go? I shouldn ’ t be late, they might change their minds.  He was fairly bouncing as they crossed the weed-strewn courtyard . The day was warm and sunny . Rivulets of water trickled down the sides of the Wall, so the ice seemed to sparkle and shine.
Inside the sept, the great crystal caught the morning light as it streamed through the south-facing window and spread it in a rainbow on the altar . Pyp ’ s mouth dropped open when he caught sight of Sam, and Toad poked Grenn in the ribs, but no one dared say a word . Septon Celladar was swinging a censer, filling the air with fragrant incense that reminded Jon of Lady Stark ’ s little sept in Winterfell . For once the septon seemed sober.
The high officers arrived in a body; Maester Aemon leaning on Clydas, Ser Alliser cold-eyed and grim, Lord Commander Mormont resplendent in a black wool doublet with silvered bearclaw fastenings . Behind them came the senior members of the three orders: red-faced Bowen Marsh the Lord Steward, First Builder Othell Yarwyck, and Ser Jaremy Rykker, who commanded the rangers in the absence of Benjen Stark.
Mormont stood before the altar, the rainbow shining on his broad bald head .  You came to us outlaws,  he began,  poachers, rapers, debtors, killers, and thieves . You came to us children . You came to us alone, in chains, with neither friends nor honor . You came to us rich, and you came to us poor . Some of you bear the names of proud houses . Others have only bastards ’ names, or no names at all . It makes no matter . All that is past now . On the Wall, we are all one house.
At evenfall, as the sun sets and we face the gathering night, you shall take your vows . From that moment, you will be a Sworn Brother of the Night ’ s Watch . Your crimes will be washed away, your debts forgiven . So too you must wash away your former loyalties, put aside your grudges, forget old wrongs and old loves alike . Here you begin anew.
A man of the Night ’ s Watch lives his life for the realm . Not for a king, nor a lord, nor the honor of this house or that house, neither for gold nor glory nor a woman ’ s love, but for the realm, and all the people in it . A man of the Night ’ s Watch takes no wife and fathers no sons . Our wife is duty . Our mistress is honor . And you are the only sons we shall ever know.
You have learned the words of the vow . Think carefully before you say them, for once you have taken the black, there is no turning back . The penalty for desertion is death.  The Old Bear paused for a moment before he said,  Are there any among you who wish to leave our company? If so, go now, and no one shall think the less of you.
No one moved.
Well and good,  said Mormont .  You may take your vows here at evenfall, before Septon Celladar and the first of your order . Do any of you keep to the old gods?
Jon stood . [BOS] I do, my lord . [EOS]
I expect you will want to say your words before a heart tree, as your uncle did,  Mormont said.
Jon said . The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him; the blood of the First Men flowed in the veins of the Starks . [BOS] Yes, my lord, [EOS]
He heard Grenn whispering behind him .  There ’ s no godswood here . Is there? I never saw a godswood.
You wouldn ’ t see a herd of aurochs until they trampled you into the snow,  Pyp whispered back.
I would so,  Grenn insisted .  I ’ d see them a long way off.
Mormont himself confirmed Grenn ’ s doubts .  Castle Black has no need of a godswood . Beyond the Wall the haunted forest stands as it stood in the Dawn Age, long before the Andals brought the Seven across the narrow sea . You will find a grove of weirwoods half a league from this spot, and mayhap your gods as well.
My lord.  The voice made Jon glance back in surprise . Samwell Tarly was on his feet . The fat boy wiped his sweaty palms against his tunic .  Might I … might I go as well? To say my words at this heart tree?
Does House Tarly keep the old gods too?  Mormont asked.
No, my lord,  Sam replied in a thin, nervous voice . The high officers frightened him, Jon knew, the Old Bear most of all .  I was named in the light of the Seven at the sept on Horn Hill, as my father was, and his father, and all the Tarlys for a thousand years.
Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House?  wondered Ser Jaremy Rykker.
The Night ’ s Watch is my House now,  Sam said .  The Seven have never answered my prayers . Perhaps the old gods will.
As you wish, boy,  Mormont said . Sam took his seat again, as did Jon .  We have placed each of you in an order, as befits our need and your own strengths and skills.  Bowen Marsh stepped forward and handed him a paper . The Lord Commander unrolled it and began to read .  Halder, to the builders,  he began . Halder gave a stiff nod of approval .  Grenn, to the rangers . Albett, to the builders . Pypar, to the rangers,  Pyp looked over at Jon and wiggled his ears .  Samwell, to the stewards,  Sam sagged with relief, mopping at his brow with a scrap of silk .  Matthar, to the rangers . Dareon, to the stewards . Todder, to the rangers . Jon, to the stewards.
The stewards! For a moment Jon could not believe what he had heard . Mormont must have read it wrong . He started to rise, to open his mouth, to tell them there had been a mistake … and then he saw Ser Alliser studying him, eyes shiny as two flakes of obsidian, and he knew.
The Old Bear rolled up the paper .  Your firsts will instruct you in your duties . May all the gods preserve you, brothers.  The Lord Commander favored them with a half bow, and took his leave . Ser Alliser went with him, a thin smile on his face . Jon had never seen the master-at-arms look quite so happy.
Rangers with me,  Ser Jaremy Rykker called when they were gone . Pyp was staring at Jon as he got slowly to his feet . His ears were red . Grenn, grinning broadly, did not seem to realize that anything was amiss . Matt and Toad fell in beside them, and they followed Ser Jaremy from the sept.
Builders,  announced lantern-jawed Othell Yarwyck . Halder and Albett trailed out after him.
Jon looked around him in sick disbelief . Maester Aemon ’ s blind eyes were raised toward the light he could not see . The septon was arranging crystals on the altar . Only Sam and Dareon remained on the benches; a fat boy, a singer … and him.
Lord Steward Bowen Marsh rubbed his plump hands together .  Samwell, you will assist Maester Aemon in the rookery and library . Chett is going to the kennels, to help with the hounds . You shall have his cell, so as to be close to the maester night and day . I trust you will take good care of him . He is very old and very precious to us.
Dareon, I am told that you sang at many a high lord ’ s table and shared their meat and mead . We are sending you to Eastwatch . It may be your palate will be some help to Cotter Pyke when merchant galleys come trading . We are paying too dear for salt beef and pickled fish, and the quality of the olive oil we ’ re getting has been frightful . Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive, he will keep you busy between ships.
Marsh turned his smile on Jon .  Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward, Jon . You ’ ll sleep in a cell beneath his chambers, in the Lord Commander ’ s tower.
Jon asked sharply . [BOS] And what will my duties be? Will I serve the Lord Commander ’ s meals, help him fasten his clothes, fetch hot water for his bath? [EOS]
Certainly.  Marsh frowned at Jon ’ s tone .  And you will run his messages, keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily, and do all else that the Lord Commander might require of you.
Do you take me for a servant?
No,  Maester Aemon said, from the back of the sept. Clydas helped him stand .  We took you for a man of Night ’ s Watch … but perhaps we were wrong in that.
It was all Jon could do to stop himself from walking out . Was he supposed to churn butter and sew doublets like a girl for the rest of his days?  May I go?  he asked stiffly.
As you wish,  Bowen Marsh responded.
Dareon and Sam left with him . They descended to the yard in silence . Outside, Jon looked up at the Wall shining in the sun, the melting ice creeping down its side in a hundred thin fingers . Jon ’ s rage was such that he would have smashed it all in an instant, and the world be damned.
Jon,  Samwell Tarly said excitedly .  Wait . Don ’ t you see what they ’ re doing?
Jon turned on him in a fury . [BOS] I see Ser Alliser ’ s bloody hand, that ’ s all I see . He wanted to shame me, and he has . [EOS]
Dareon gave him a look .  The stewards are fine for the likes of you and me, Sam, but not for Lord Snow.
Jon blazed back . [BOS] I ’ m a better swordsman and a better rider than any of you, It ’ s not fair . [EOS]
Fair?  Dareon sneered .  The girl was waiting for me, naked as the day she was born . She pulled me through the window, and you talk to me of fair?  He walked off.
There is no shame in being a steward,  Sam said.
Do you think I want to spend the rest of my life washing an old man ’ s smallclothes?
The old man is Lord Commander of the Night ’ s Watch,  Sam reminded him .  You ’ ll be with him day and night . Yes, you ’ ll pour his wine and see that his bed linen is fresh, but you ’ ll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle . You ’ ll be as close to him as his shadow . You ’ ll know everything, be a part of everything … and the Lord Steward said Mormont asked for you himself!
When I was little, my father used to insist that I attend him in the audience chamber whenever he held court . When he rode to Highgarden to bend his knee to Lord Tyrell, he made me come . Later, though, he started to take Dickon and leave me at home, and he no longer cared whether I sat through his audiences, so long as Dickon was there . He wanted his heir at his side, don ’ t you see? To watch and listen and learn from all he did . I ’ ll wager that ’ s why Lord Mormont requested you, Jon . What else could it be? He wants to groom you for command!
Jon was taken aback . It was true, Lord Eddard had often made Robb part of his councils back at Winterfell . Could Sam be right? Even a bastard could rise high in the Night ’ s Watch, they said . [BOS] I never asked for this, [EOS] he said stubbornly.
None of us are here for asking,  Sam reminded him.
And suddenly Jon Snow was ashamed.
Craven or not, Samwell Tarly had found the courage to accept his fate like a man . On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns, Benjen Stark had said the last night Jon had seen him alive . You ’ re no ranger, Jon, only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you . He ’ d heard it said that bastards grow up faster than other children; on the Wall, you grew up or you died.
Jon let out a deep sigh . [BOS] You have the right of it . I was acting the boy . [EOS]
Then you ’ ll stay and say your words with me?
The old gods will be expecting us.  He made himself smile.
They set out late that afternoon . The Wall had no gates as such, neither here at Castle Black nor anywhere along its three hundred miles . They led their horses down a narrow tunnel cut through the ice, cold dark walls pressing in around them as the passage twisted and turned . Three times their way was blocked by iron bars, and they had to stop while Bowen Marsh drew out his keys and unlocked the massive chains that secured them . Jon could sense the vast weight pressing down on him as he waited behind the Lord Steward . The air was colder than a tomb, and more still . He felt a strange relief when they reemerged into the afternoon light on the north side of the Wall.
Sam blinked at the sudden glare and looked around apprehensively .  The Wildlings … they wouldn ’ t … they ’ d never dare come this close to the Wall . Would they?
Jon climbed into his saddle . When Bowen Marsh and their ranger escort had mounted, Jon put two fingers in his mouth and whistled . Ghost came loping out of the tunnel . [BOS] They never have. [EOS]
The Lord Steward ’ s garron whickered and backed away from the direwolf .  Do you mean to take that beast?
Jon said . Ghost ’ s head lifted . He seemed to taste the air . In the blink of an eye he was off, racing across the broad, weed-choked field to vanish in the trees . [BOS] Yes, my lord, [EOS]
Once they had entered the forest, they were in a different world . Jon had often hunted with his father and Jory and his brother Robb . He knew the wolfswood around Winterfell as well as any man . The haunted forest was much the same, and yet the feel of it was very different.
Perhaps it was all in the knowing . They had ridden past the end of the world; somehow that changed everything . Every shadow seemed darker, every sound more ominous . The trees pressed close and shut out the light of the setting sun . A thin crust of snow cracked beneath the hooves of their horses, with a sound like breaking bones . When the wind set the leaves to rustling, it was like a chilly finger tracing a path up Jon ’ s spine . The Wall was at their backs, and only the gods knew what lay ahead.
The sun was sinking below the trees when they reached their destination, a small clearing in the deep of the wood where nine weirwoods grew in a rough circle . Jon drew in a breath, and he saw Sam Tarly staring . Even in the wolfswood, you never found more than two or three of the white trees growing together; a grove of nine was unheard of . The forest floor was carpeted with fallen leaves, bloodred on top, black rot beneath . The wide smooth trunks were bone pale, and nine faces stared inward . The dried sap that crusted in the eyes was red and hard as ruby . Bowen Marsh commanded them to leave their horses outside the circle .  This is a sacred place, we will not defile it.
When they entered the grove, Samwell Tarly turned slowly looking at each face in turn . No two were quite alike .  They ’ re watching us,  he whispered .  The old gods.
Yes.  Jon knelt, and Sam knelt beside him.
They said the words together, as the last light faded in the west and grey day became black night.
Hear my words, and bear witness to my vow,  they recited, their voices filling the twilit grove .  Night gathers, and now my watch begins . It shall not end until my death . I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children . I shall wear no crowns and win no glory . I shall live and die at my post . I am the sword in the darkness . I am the watcher on the walls . I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men . I pledge my life and honor to the Night ’ s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.
The woods fell silent .  You knelt as boys,  Bowen Marsh intoned solemnly .  Rise now as men of the Night ’ s Watch.
Jon held out a hand to pull Sam back to his feet . The rangers gathered round to offer smiles and congratulations, all but the gnarled old forester Dywen .  Best we be starting back, m ’ lord,  he said to Bowen Marsh .  Dark ’ s falling, and there ’ s something in the smell o ’ the night that I mislike.
And suddenly Ghost was back, stalking softly between two weirwoods . White fur and red eyes, Jon realized, disquieted . Like the trees …
The wolf had something in his jaws . Something black .  What ’ s he got there?  asked Bowen Marsh, frowning.
To me, Ghost.  Jon knelt .  Bring it here.
The direwolf trotted to him . Jon heard Samwell Tarly ’ s sharp intake of breath.
Gods be good,  Dywen muttered .  That ’ s a hand.
Othor,  announced Ser Jaremy Rykker,  beyond a doubt . And this one was Jafer Flowers.  He turned the corpse over with his foot, and the dead white face stared up at the overcast sky with blue, blue eyes .  They were Ben Stark ’ s men, both of them.
My uncle ’ s men, Jon thought numbly . He remembered how he ’ d pleaded to ride with them . Gods, I was such a green boy . If he had taken me, it might be me lying here …
Jafer ’ s right wrist ended in the ruin of torn flesh and splintered bone left by Ghost ’ s jaws . His right hand was floating in a jar of vinegar back in Maester Aemon ’ s tower . His left hand, still at the end of his arm, was as black as his cloak.
Gods have mercy,  the Old Bear muttered . He swung down from his garron, handing his reins to Jon . The morning was unnaturally warm; beads of sweat dotted the Lord Commander ’ s broad forehead like dew on a melon . His horse was nervous, rolling her eyes, backing away from the dead men as far as her lead would allow . Jon led her off a few paces, fighting to keep her from bolting . The horses did not like the feel of this place . For that matter, neither did Jon.
The dogs liked it least of all . Ghost had led the party here; the pack of hounds had been useless . When Bass the kennelmaster had tried to get them to take the scent from the severed hand, they had gone wild, yowling and barking, fighting to get away . Even now they were snarling and whimpering by turns, pulling at their leashes while Chett cursed them for curs.
It is only a wood, Jon told himself, and they ’ re only dead men . He had seen dead men before …
Last night he had dreamt the Winterfell dream again . He was wandering the empty castle, searching for his father, descending into the crypts . Only this time the dream had gone further than before . In the dark he ’ d heard the scrape of stone on stone . When he turned he saw that the vaults were opening, one after the other . As the dead kings came stumbling from their cold black graves, Jon had woken in pitch-dark, his heart hammering . Even when Ghost leapt up on the bed to nuzzle at his face, he could not shake his deep sense of terror . He dared not go back to sleep . Instead he had climbed the Wall and walked, restless, until he saw the light of the dawn off to the east . It was only a dream . I am a brother of the Night ’ s Watch now, not a frightened boy.
Samwell Tarly huddled beneath the trees, half-hidden behind the horses . His round fat face was the color of curdled milk . So far he had not lurched off to the woods to retch, but he had not so much as glanced at the dead men either .  I can ’ t look,  he whispered miserably.
Jon told him, keeping his voice low so the others would not hear . [BOS] You have to look, Maester Aemon sent you to be his eyes, didn ’ t he? What good are eyes if they ’ re shut? [EOS]
Yes, but … I ’ m such a coward, Jon.
Jon put a hand on Sam ’ s shoulder . [BOS] We have a dozen rangers with us, and the dogs, even Ghost . No one will hurt you, Sam . Go ahead and look . The first look is the hardest . [EOS]
Sam gave a tremulous nod, working up his courage with a visible effort . Slowly he swiveled his head . His eyes widened, but Jon held his arm so he could not turn away.
Ser Jaremy,  the Old Bear asked gruffly,  Ben Stark had six men with him when he rode from the Wall . Where are the others?
Ser Jaremy shook his head .  Would that I knew.
Plainly Mormont was not pleased with that answer .  Two of our brothers butchered almost within sight of the Wall, yet your rangers heard nothing, saw nothing . Is this what the Night ’ s Watch has fallen to? Do we still sweep these woods?
Yes, my lord, but—
Do we still mount watches?
We do, but—
This man wears a hunting horn.  Mormont pointed at Othor .  Must I suppose that he died without sounding it? Or have your rangers all gone deaf as well as blind?
Ser Jaremy bristled, his face taut with anger .  No horn was blown, my lord, or my rangers would have heard it . I do not have sufficient men to mount as many patrols as I should like … and since Benjen was lost, we have stayed closer to the Wall than we were wont to do before, by your own command.
The Old Bear grunted .  Yes . Well . Be that as it may.  He made an impatient gesture .  Tell me how they died.
Squatting beside the dead man he had named Jafer Flowers, Ser Jaremy grasped his head by the scalp . The hair came out between his fingers, brittle as straw . The knight cursed and shoved at the face with the heel of his hand . A great gash in the side of the corpse ’ s neck opened like a mouth, crusted with dried blood . Only a few ropes of pale tendon still attached the head to the neck .  This was done with an axe.
Aye,  muttered Dywen, the old forester .  Belike the axe that Othor carried, m ’ lord.
Jon could feel his breakfast churning in his belly, but he pressed his lips together and made himself look at the second body . Othor had been a big ugly man, and he made a big ugly corpse . No axe was in evidence . Jon remembered Othor; he had been the one bellowing the bawdy song as the rangers rode out . His singing days were done . His flesh was blanched white as milk, everywhere but his hands . His hands were black like Jafer ’ s . Blossoms of hard cracked blood decorated the mortal wounds that covered him like a rash, breast and groin and throat . Yet his eyes were still open . They stared up at the sky, blue as sapphires.
Ser Jaremy stood .  The Wildlings have axes too.
Mormont rounded on him .  So you believe this is Mance Rayder ’ s work? This close to the Wall?
Who else, my lord?
Jon could have told him . He knew, they all knew, yet no man of them would say the words . The Others are only a story, a tale to make children shiver . If they ever lived at all, they are gone eight thousand years . Even the thought made him feel foolish; he was a man grown now, a black brother of the Night ’ s Watch, not the boy who ’ d once sat at Old Nan ’ s feet with Bran and Robb and Arya.
Yet Lord Commander Mormont gave a snort .  If Ben Stark had come under Wildling attack a half day ’ s ride from Castle Black, he would have returned for more men, chased the killers through all seven hells and brought me back their heads.
Unless he was slain as well,  Ser Jaremy insisted.
The words hurt, even now . It had been so long, it seemed folly to cling to the hope that Ben Stark was still alive, but Jon Snow was nothing if not stubborn.
It has been close on half a year since Benjen left us, my lord,  Ser Jaremy went on .  The forest is vast . The Wildlings might have fallen on him anywhere . I ’ d wager these two were the last survivors of his party, on their way back to us … but the enemy caught them before they could reach the safety of the Wall . The corpses are still fresh, these men cannot have been dead more than a day …
NO,  Samwell Tarly squeaked.
Jon was startled . Sam ’ s nervous, high-pitched voice was the last he would have expected to hear . The fat boy was frightened of the officers, and Ser Jaremy was not known for his patience.
I did not ask for your views, boy,  Rykker said coldly.
Jon blurted . [BOS] Let him speak, ser, [EOS]
Mormont ’ s eyes flicked from Sam to Jon and back again .  If the lad has something to say, I ’ ll hear him out . Come closer, boy . We can ’ t see you behind those horses.
Sam edged past Jon and the garrons, sweating profusely .  My lord, it … it can ’ t be a day or … look … the blood …
Yes?  Mormont growled impatiently .  Blood, what of it?
He soils his smallclothes at the sight of it,  Chett shouted out, and the rangers laughed.
Sam mopped at the sweat on his brow .  You … you can see where Ghost … Jon ’ s direwolf … you can see where he tore off that man ’ s hand, and yet … the stump hasn ’ t bled, look …  He waved a hand .  My father … L-lord Randyll, he, he made me watch him dress animals sometimes, when … after …  Sam shook his head from side to side, his chins quivering . Now that he had looked at the bodies, he could not seem to look away .  A fresh kill … the blood would still flow, my lords . Later … later it would be clotted, like a … a jelly, thick and … and …  He looked as though he was going to be sick .  This man … look at the wrist, it ’ s all … crusty … dry … like …
Jon saw at once what Sam meant . He could see the torn veins in the dead man ’ s wrist, iron worms in the pale flesh . His blood was a black dust . Yet Jaremy Rykker was unconvinced . [BOS] If they ’ d been dead much longer than a day, they ’ d be ripe by now, boy . They don ’ t even smell . [EOS]
Dywen, the gnarled old forester who liked to boast that he could smell snow coming on, sidled closer to the corpses and took a whiff .  Well, they ’ re no pansy flowers, but … m ’ lord has the truth of it . There ’ s no corpse stink.
They … they aren ’ t rotting.  Sam pointed, his fat finger shaking only a little .  Look, there ’ s … there ’ s no maggots or … or … worms or anything … they ’ ve been lying here in the woods, but they … they haven ’ t been chewed or eaten by animals … only Ghost … otherwise they ’ re … they ’ re …
Jon said softly . [BOS] Untouched, And Ghost is different . The dogs and the horses won ’ t go near them . [EOS]
The rangers exchanged glances; they could see it was true, every man of them . Mormont frowned, glancing from the corpses to the dogs .  Chett, bring the hounds closer.
Chett tried, cursing, yanking on the leashes, giving one animal a lick of his boot . Most of the dogs just whimpered and planted their feet . He tried dragging one . The bitch resisted, growling and squirming as if to escape her collar . Finally she lunged at him . Chett dropped the leash and stumbled backward . The dog leapt over him and bounded off into the trees.
This … this is all wrong,  Sam Tarly said earnestly .  The blood … there ’ s bloodstains on their clothes, and … and their flesh, dry and hard, but … there ’ s none on the ground, or … anywhere . With those … those … those …  Sam made himself swallow, took a deep breath .  With those wounds … terrible wounds … there should be blood all over . Shouldn ’ t there?
Dywen sucked at his wooden teeth .  Might be they didn ’ t die here . Might be someone brought ’ em and left ’ em for us . A warning, as like.  The old forester peered down suspiciously .  And might be I ’ m a fool, but I don ’ t know that Othor never had no blue eyes afore.
Ser Jaremy looked startled .  Neither did Flowers,  he blurted, turning to stare at the dead man.
A silence fell over the wood . For a moment all they heard was Sam ’ s heavy breathing and the wet sound of Dywen sucking on his teeth . Jon squatted beside Ghost.
Burn them,  someone whispered . One of the rangers; Jon could not have said who .  Yes, burn them,  a second voice urged.
The Old Bear gave a stubborn shake of his head .  Not yet . I want Maester Aemon to have a look at them . We ’ ll bring them back to the Wall.
Some commands are more easily given than obeyed . They wrapped the dead men in cloaks, but when Hake and Dywen tried to tie one onto a horse, the animal went mad, screaming and rearing, lashing out with its hooves, even biting at Ketter when he ran to help . The rangers had no better luck with the other garrons; not even the most placid wanted any part of these burdens . In the end they were forced to hack off branches and fashion crude slings to carry the corpses back on foot . It was well past midday by the time they started back.
I will have these woods searched,  Mormont commanded Ser Jaremy as they set out .  Every tree, every rock, every bush, and every foot of muddy ground within ten leagues of here . Use all the men you have, and if you do not have enough, borrow hunters and foresters from the stewards . If Ben and the others are out here, dead or alive, I will have them found . And if there is anyone else in these woods, I will know of it . You are to track them and take them, alive if possible . Is that understood?
It is, my lord,  Ser Jaremy said .  It will be done.
After that, Mormont rode in silence, brooding . Jon followed close behind him; as the Lord Commander ’ s steward, that was his place . The day was grey, damp, overcast, the sort of day that made you wish for rain . No wind stirred the wood; the air hung humid and heavy, and Jon ’ s clothes clung to his skin . It was warm . Too warm . The Wall was weeping copiously, had been weeping for days, and sometimes Jon even imagined it was shrinking.
The old men called this weather spirit summer, and said it meant the season was giving up its ghosts at last . After this the cold would come, they warned, and a long summer always meant a long winter . This summer had lasted ten years . Jon had been a babe in arms when it began.
Ghost ran with them for a time and then vanished among the trees . Without the direwolf, Jon felt almost naked . He found himself glancing at every shadow with unease . Unbidden, he thought back on the tales that Old Nan used to tell them, when he was a boy at Winterfell . He could almost hear her voice again, and the click-click-click of her needles . In that darkness, the Others came riding, she used to say, dropping her voice lower and lower . Cold and dead they were, and they hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every living creature with hot blood in its veins . Holdfasts and cities and kingdoms of men all fell before them, as they moved south on pale dead horses, leading hosts of the slain . They fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children …
When he caught his first glimpse of the Wall looming above the tops of an ancient gnarled oak, Jon was vastly relieved . Mormont reined up suddenly and turned in his saddle .  Tarly,  he barked,  come here.
Jon saw the start of fright on Sam ’ s face as he lumbered up on his mare; doubtless he thought he was in trouble .  You ’ re fat but you ’ re not stupid, boy,  the Old Bear said gruffly .  You did well back there . And you, Snow.
Sam blushed a vivid crimson and tripped over his own tongue as he tried to stammer out a courtesy . Jon had to smile.
When they emerged from under the trees, Mormont spurred his tough little garron to a trot . Ghost came streaking out from the woods to meet them, licking his chops, his muzzle red from prey . High above, the men on the Wall saw the column approaching . Jon heard the deep, throaty call of the watchman ’ s great horn, calling out across the miles; a single long blast that shuddered through the trees and echoed off the ice.
The sound faded slowly to silence . One blast meant rangers returning, and Jon thought, I was a ranger for one day, at least . Whatever may come, they cannot take that away from me.
Bowen Marsh was waiting at the first gate as they led their garrons through the icy tunnel . The Lord Steward was red-faced and agitated .  My lord,  he blurted at Mormont as he swung open the iron bars,  there ’ s been a bird, you must come at once.
What is it, man?  Mormont said gruffly.
Curiously, Marsh glanced at Jon before he answered .  Maester Aemon has the letter . He ’ s waiting in your solar.
Very well . Jon, see to my horse, and tell Ser Jaremy to put the dead men in a storeroom until the maester is ready for them.  Mormont strode away grumbling.
As they led their horses back to the stable, Jon was uncomfortably aware that people were watching him . Ser Alliser Thorne was drilling his boys in the yard, but he broke off to stare at Jon, a faint half smile on his lips . One-armed Donal Noye stood in the door of the armory .  The gods be with you, Snow,  he called out.
Something ’ s wrong, Jon thought . Something ’ s very wrong.
The dead men were carried to one of the storerooms along the base of the Wall, a dark cold cell chiseled from the ice and used to keep meat and grain and sometimes even beer . Jon saw that Mormont ’ s horse was fed and watered and groomed before he took care of his own . Afterward he sought out his friends . Grenn and Toad were on watch, but he found Pyp in the common hall .  What ’ s happened?  he asked.
Pyp lowered his voice .  The king ’ s dead.
Jon was stunned . Robert Baratheon had looked old and fat when he visited Winterfell, yet he ’ d seemed hale enough, and there ’ d been no talk of illness . [BOS] How can you know? [EOS]
One of the guards overheard Clydas reading the letter to Maester Aemon.  Pyp leaned close .  Jon, I ’ m sorry . He was your father ’ s friend, wasn ’ t he?
Jon wondered if Joffrey would keep his father as the King ’ s Hand . It did not seem likely . That might mean Lord Eddard would return to Winterfell, and his sisters as well . He might even be allowed to visit them, with Lord Mormont ’ s permission . It would be good to see Arya ’ s grin again and to talk with his father . I will ask him about my mother, he resolved . I am a man now, it is past time he told me . Even if she was a whore, I don ’ t care, I want to know . [BOS] They were as close as brothers, once. [EOS]
I heard Hake say the dead men were your uncle ’ s,  Pyp said.
Jon replied . [BOS] Yes, Two of the six he took with him . They ’ d been dead a long time, only … the bodies are queer . [EOS]
Queer?  Pyp was all curiosity .  How queer?
Sam will tell you.  Jon did not want to talk of it .  I should see if the Old Bear has need of me.
He walked to the Lord Commander ’ s Tower alone, with a curious sense of apprehension . The brothers on guard eyed him solemnly as he approached .  The Old Bear ’ s in his solar,  one of them announced .  He was asking for you.
Jon nodded . He should have come straight from the stable . He climbed the tower steps briskly . He wants wine or a fire in his hearth, that ’ s all, he told himself.
When he entered the solar, Mormont ’ s raven screamed at him .  Corn!  the bird shrieked .  Corn! Corn! Corn!
Don ’ t you believe it, I just fed him,  the Old Bear growled . He was seated by the window, reading a letter .  Bring me a cup of wine, and pour one for yourself.
For myself, my lord?
Mormont lifted his eyes from the letter to stare at Jon . There was pity in that look; he could taste it .  You heard me.
Jon poured with exaggerated care, vaguely aware that he was drawing out the act . When the cups were filled, he would have no choice but to face whatever was in that letter . Yet all too soon, they were filled .  Sit, boy,  Mormont commanded him .  Drink.
Jon remained standing . [BOS] It ’ s my father, isn ’ t it? [EOS]
The Old Bear tapped the letter with a finger .  Your father and the king,  he rumbled .  I won ’ t lie to you, it ’ s grievous news . I never thought to see another king, not at my age, with Robert half my years and strong as a bull.  He took a gulp of wine .  They say the king loved to hunt . The things we love destroy us every time, lad . Remember that . My son loved that young wife of his . Vain woman . If not for her, he would never have thought to sell those poachers.
Jon could scarcely follow what he was saying . [BOS] My lord, I don ’ t understand . What ’ s happened to my father? [EOS]
I told you to sit,  Mormont grumbled .  Sit,  the raven screamed .  And have a drink, damn you . That ’ s a command, Snow.
Jon sat, and took a sip of wine.
Lord Eddard has been imprisoned . He is charged with treason . It is said he plotted with Robert ’ s brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
Jon said at once . [BOS] No, That couldn ’ t be . My father would never betray the king! [EOS]
Be that as it may,  said Mormont .  It is not for me to say . Nor for you.
Jon insisted . How could they think his father was a traitor, had they all gone mad? Lord Eddard Stark would never dishonor himself … would he? [BOS] But it ’ s a lie, [EOS]
He fathered a bastard, a small voice whispered inside him . Where was the honor in that? And your mother, what of her? He will not even speak her name.
My lord, what will happen to him? Will they kill him?
As to that, I cannot say, lad . I mean to send a letter . I knew some of the king ’ s councillors in my youth . Old Pycelle, Lord Stannis, Ser Barristan … Whatever your father has done, or hasn ’ t done, he is a great lord . He must be allowed to take the black and join us here . Gods knows, we need men of Lord Eddard ’ s ability.
Jon knew that other men accused of treason had been allowed to redeem their honor on the Wall in days past . Why not Lord Eddard? His father here . That was a strange thought, and strangely uncomfortable . It would be a monstrous injustice to strip him of Winterfell and force him to take the black, and yet if it meant his life …
And would Joffrey allow it? He remembered the prince at Winterfell, the way he ’ d mocked Robb and Ser Rodrik in the yard . Jon himself he had scarcely even noticed; bastards were beneath even his contempt .  My lord, will the king listen to you?
The Old Bear shrugged .  A boy king … I imagine he ’ ll listen to his mother . A pity the dwarf isn ’ t with them . He ’ s the lad ’ s uncle, and he saw our need when he visited us . It was a bad thing, your lady mother taking him captive—
Jon reminded him sharply . Tyrion Lannister had been a friend to him . If Lord Eddard was killed, she would be as much to blame as the queen . [BOS] Lady Stark is not my mother, My lord, what of my sisters? Arya and Sansa, they were with my father, do you know— [EOS]
Pycelle makes no mention of them, but doubtless they ’ ll be treated gently . I will ask about them when I write.  Mormont shook his head .  This could not have happened at a worse time . If ever the realm needed a strong king … there are dark days and cold nights ahead, I feel it in my bones …  He gave Jon a long shrewd look .  I hope you are not thinking of doing anything stupid, boy.
He ’ s my father, Jon wanted to say, but he knew that Mormont would not want to hear it . His throat was dry . He made himself take another sip of wine.
Your duty is here now,  the Lord Commander reminded him .  Your old life ended when you took the black.  His bird made a raucous echo .  Black.  Mormont took no notice .  Whatever they do in King ’ s Landing is none of our concern.  When Jon did not answer, the old man finished his wine and said,  You ’ re free to go . I ’ ll have no further need of you today . On the morrow you can help me write that letter.
Jon did not remember standing or leaving the solar . The next he knew, he was descending the tower steps, thinking, This is my father, my sisters, how can it be none of my concern.
Outside, one of the guards looked at him and said,  Be strong, boy . The gods are cruel.
They know, Jon realized .  My father is no traitor,  he said hoarsely . Even the words stuck in his throat, as if to choke him . The wind was rising, and it seemed colder in the yard than it had when he ’ d gone in . Spirit summer was drawing to an end.
The rest of the afternoon passed as if in a dream . Jon could not have said where he walked, what he did, who he spoke with . Ghost was with him, he knew that much . The silent presence of the direwolf gave him comfort . The girls do not even have that much, he thought . Their wolves might have kept them safe, but Lady is dead and Nymeria ’ s lost, they ’ re all alone.
A north wind had begun to blow by the time the sun went down . Jon could hear it skirling against the Wall and over the icy battlements as he went to the common hall for the evening meal . Hobb had cooked up a venison stew, thick with barley, onions, and carrots . When he spooned an extra portion onto Jon ’ s plate and gave him the crusty heel of the bread, he knew what it meant . He knows . He looked around the hall, saw heads turn quickly, eyes politely averted . They all know.
His friends rallied to him .  We asked the septon to light a candle for your father,  Matthar told him .  It ’ s a lie, we all know it ’ s a lie, even Grenn knows it ’ s a lie,  Pyp chimed in . Grenn nodded, and Sam clasped Jon ’ s hand,  You ’ re my brother now, so he ’ s my father too,  the fat boy said .  If you want to go out to the weirwoods and pray to the old gods, I ’ ll go with you.
The weirwoods were beyond the Wall, yet he knew Sam meant what he said . They are my brothers, he thought . As much as Robb and Bran and Rickon …
And then he heard the laughter, sharp and cruel as a whip, and the voice of Ser Alliser Thorne .  Not only a bastard, but a traitor ’ s bastard,  he was telling the men around him.
In the blink of an eye, Jon had vaulted onto the table, dagger in his hand . Pyp made a grab for him, but he wrenched his leg away, and then he was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from Ser Alliser ’ s hand . Stew went flying everywhere, spattering the brothers . Thorne recoiled . People were shouting, but Jon Snow did not hear them . He lunged at Ser Alliser ’ s face with the dagger, slashing at those cold onyx eyes, but Sam threw himself between them and before Jon could get around him, Pyp was on his back clinging like a monkey, and Grenn was grabbing his arm while Toad wrenched the knife from his fingers.
Later, much later, after they had marched him back to his sleeping cell, Mormont came down to see him, raven on his shoulder .  I told you not to do anything stupid, boy,  the Old Bear said .  Boy,  the bird chorused . Mormont shook his head, disgusted .  And to think I had high hopes for you.
They took his knife and his sword and told him he was not to leave his cell until the high officers met to decide what was to be done with him . And then they placed a guard outside his door to make certain he obeyed . His friends were not allowed to see him, but the Old Bear did relent and permit him Ghost, so he was not utterly alone.
My father is no traitor,  he told the direwolf when the rest had gone . Ghost looked at him in silence . Jon slumped against the wall, hands around his knees, and stared at the candle on the table beside his narrow bed . The flame flickered and swayed, the shadows moved around him, the room seemed to grow darker and colder . I will not sleep tonight, Jon thought.
Yet he must have dozed . When he woke, his legs were stiff and cramped and the candle had long since burned out . Ghost stood on his hind legs, scrabbling at the door . Jon was startled to see how tall he ’ d grown .  Ghost, what is it?  he called softly . The direwolf turned his head and looked down at him, baring his fangs in a silent snarl . Has he gone mad? Jon wondered .  It ’ s me, Ghost,  he murmured, trying not to sound afraid . Yet he was trembling, violently . When had it gotten so cold?
Ghost backed away from the door . There were deep gouges where he ’ d raked the wood . Jon watched him with mounting disquiet .  There ’ s someone out there, isn ’ t there?  he whispered . Crouching, the direwolf crept backward, white fur rising on the back of his neck . The guard, he thought, they left a man to guard my door, Ghost smells him through the door, that ’ s all it is.
Slowly, Jon pushed himself to his feet . He was shivering uncontrollably, wishing he still had a sword . Three quick steps brought him to the door . He grabbed the handle and pulled it inward . The creak of the hinges almost made him jump.
His guard was sprawled bonelessly across the narrow steps, looking up at him . Looking up at him, even though he was lying on his stomach . His head had been twisted completely around.
It can ’ t be, Jon told himself . This is the Lord Commander ’ s Tower, it ’ s guarded day and night, this couldn ’ t happen, it ’ s a dream, I ’ m having a nightmare.
Ghost slid past him, out the door . The wolf started up the steps, stopped, looked back at Jon . That was when he heard it; the soft scrape of a boot on stone, the sound of a latch turning . The sounds came from above . From the Lord Commander ’ s chambers.
A nightmare this might be, yet it was no dream.
The guard ’ s sword was in its sheath . Jon knelt and worked it free . The heft of steel in his fist made him bolder . He moved up the steps, Ghost padding silently before him . Shadows lurked in every turn of the stair . Jon crept up warily, probing any suspicious darkness with the point of his sword.
Suddenly he heard the shriek of Mormont ’ s raven .  Corn,  the bird was screaming .  Corn, corn, corn, corn, corn, corn.  Ghost bounded ahead, and Jon came scrambling after . The door to Mormont ’ s solar was wide open . The direwolf plunged through . Jon stopped in the doorway, blade in hand, giving his eyes a moment to adjust . Heavy drapes had been pulled across the windows, and the darkness was black as ink .  Who ’ s there?  he called out.
Then he saw it, a shadow in the shadows, sliding toward the inner door that led to Mormont ’ s sleeping cell, a man-shape all in black, cloaked and hooded … but beneath the hood, its eyes shone with an icy blue radiance …
Ghost leapt . Man and wolf went down together with neither scream nor snarl, rolling, smashing into a chair, knocking over a table laden with papers . Mormont ’ s raven was flapping overhead, screaming, Jon felt as blind as Maester Aemon . Keeping the wall to his back, he slid toward the window and ripped down the curtain . Moonlight flooded the solar . He glimpsed black hands buried in white fur, swollen dark fingers tightening around his direwolf ’ s throat . Ghost was twisting and snapping, legs flailing in the air, but he could not break free . [BOS] Corn, corn, corn, corn. [EOS]
Jon had no time to be afraid . He threw himself forward, shouting, bringing down the longsword with all his weight behind it . Steel sheared through sleeve and skin and bone, yet the sound was wrong somehow . The smell that engulfed him was so queer and cold he almost gagged . He saw arm and hand on the floor, black fingers wriggling in a pool of moonlight . Ghost wrenched free of the other hand and crept away, red tongue lolling from his mouth.
The hooded man lifted his pale moon face, and Jon slashed at it without hesitation . The sword laid the intruder open to the bone, taking off half his nose and opening a gash cheek to cheek under those eyes, eyes, eyes like blue stars burning . Jon knew that face . Othor, he thought, reeling back . Gods, he ’ s dead, he ’ s dead, I saw him dead.
He felt something scrabble at his ankle . Black fingers clawed at his calf . The arm was crawling up his leg, ripping at wool and flesh . Shouting with revulsion, Jon pried the fingers off his leg with the point of his sword and flipped the thing away . It lay writhing, fingers opening and closing.
The corpse lurched forward . There was no blood . One-armed, face cut near in half, it seemed to feel nothing . Jon held the longsword before him .  Stay away!  he commanded, his voice gone shrill .  Corn,  screamed the raven,  corn, corn.  The severed arm was wriggling out of its torn sleeve, a pale snake with a black five-fingered head . Ghost pounced and got it between his teeth . Finger bones crunched . Jon hacked at the corpse ’ s neck, felt the steel bite deep and hard.
Dead Othor slammed into him, knocking him off his feet.
Jon ’ s breath went out of him as the fallen table caught him between his shoulder blades . The sword, where was the sword? He ’ d lost the damned sword! When he opened his mouth to scream, the wight jammed its black corpse fingers into Jon ’ s mouth . Gagging, he tried to shove it off, but the dead man was too heavy . Its hand forced itself farther down his throat, icy cold, choking him . Its face was against his own, filling the world . Frost covered its eyes, sparkling blue . Jon raked cold flesh with his nails and kicked at the thing ’ s legs . He tried to bite, tried to punch, tried to breathe …
And suddenly the corpse ’ s weight was gone, its fingers ripped from his throat . It was all Jon could do to roll over, retching and shaking . Ghost had it again . He watched as the direwolf buried his teeth in the wight ’ s gut and began to rip and tear . He watched, only half conscious, for a long moment before he finally remembered to look for his sword …
… and saw Lord Mormont, naked and groggy from sleep, standing in the doorway with an oil lamp in hand . Gnawed and fingerless, the arm thrashed on the floor, wriggling toward him.
Jon tried to shout, but his voice was gone . Staggering to his feet, he kicked the arm away and snatched the lamp from the Old Bear ’ s fingers . The flame flickered and almost died .  Burn!  the raven cawed .  Burn, burn, burn!
Spinning, Jon saw the drapes he ’ d ripped from the window . He flung the lamp into the puddled cloth with both hands . Metal crunched, glass shattered, oil spewed, and the hangings went up in a great whoosh of flame . The heat of it on his face was sweeter than any kiss Jon had ever known .  Ghost!  he shouted.
The direwolf wrenched free and came to him as the wight struggled to rise, dark snakes spilling from the great wound in its belly . Jon plunged his hand into the flames, grabbed a fistful of the burning drapes, and whipped them at the dead man . Let it burn, he prayed as the cloth smothered the corpse, gods, please, please, let it burn.
Are you well, Snow?  Lord Mormont asked, scowling.
Well,  his raven squawked .  Well.
Jon lied … loudly, as if that could make it true . [BOS] I am, my lord, And you? [EOS]
Mormont frowned .  A dead man tried to kill me . How well could I be?  He scratched under his chin . His shaggy grey beard had been singed in the fire, and he ’ d hacked it off . The pale stubble of his new whiskers made him look old, disreputable, and grumpy .  You do not look well . How is your hand?
Jon flexed his bandaged fingers to show him . He had burned himself more badly than he knew throwing the flaming drapes, and his right hand was swathed in silk halfway to the elbow . At the time he ’ d felt nothing; the agony had come after . His cracked red skin oozed fluid, and fearsome blood blisters rose between his fingers, big as roaches . [BOS] Healing. The maester says I ’ ll have scars, but otherwise the hand should be as good as it was before . [EOS]
A scarred hand is nothing . On the Wall, you ’ ll be wearing gloves often as not.
As you say, my lord.  It was not the thought of scars that troubled Jon; it was the rest of it . Maester Aemon had given him milk of the poppy, yet even so, the pain had been hideous . At first it had felt as if his hand were still aflame, burning day and night . Only plunging it into basins of snow and shaved ice gave any relief at all . Jon thanked the gods that no one but Ghost saw him writhing on his bed, whimpering from the pain . And when at last he did sleep, he dreamt, and that was even worse . In the dream, the corpse he fought had blue eyes, black hands, and his father ’ s face, but he dared not tell Mormont that.
Dywen and Hake returned last night,  the Old Bear said .  They found no sign of your uncle, no more than the others did.
I know.  Jon had dragged himself to the common hall to sup with his friends, and the failure of the rangers ’ search had been all the men had been talking of.
You know,  Mormont grumbled .  How is it that everyone knows everything around here?  He did not seem to expect an answer .  It would seem there were only the two of … of those creatures, whatever they were, I will not call them men . And thank the gods for that . Any more and … well, that doesn ’ t bear thinking of . There will be more, though . I can feel it in these old bones of mine, and Maester Aemon agrees . The cold winds are rising . Summer is at an end, and a winter is coming such as this world has never seen.
Winter is coming . The Stark words had never sounded so grim or ominous to Jon as they did now .  My lord,  he asked hesitantly,  it ’ s said there was a bird last night …
There was . What of it?
I had hoped for some word of my father.
Father,  taunted the old raven, bobbing its head as it walked across Mormont ’ s shoulders .  Father.
The Lord Commander reached up to pinch its beak shut, but the raven hopped up on his head, fluttered its wings, and flew across the chamber to light above a window .  Grief and noise,  Mormont grumbled .  That ’ s all they ’ re good for, ravens . Why I put up with that pestilential bird … if there was news of Lord Eddard, don ’ t you think I would have sent for you? Bastard or no, you ’ re still his blood . The message concerned Ser Barristan Selmy . It seems he ’ s been removed from the Kingsguard . They gave his place to that black dog Clegane, and now Selmy ’ s wanted for treason . The fools sent some watchmen to seize him, but he slew two of them and escaped.  Mormont snorted, leaving no doubt of his view of men who ’ d send gold cloaks against a knight as renowed as Barristan the Bold .  We have white shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls, and a boy sits the Iron Throne,  he said in disgust.
The raven laughed shrilly .  Boy, boy, boy, boy.
Ser Barristan had been the Old Bear ’ s best hope, Jon remembered; if he had fallen, what chance was there that Mormont ’ s letter would be heeded? He curled his hand into a fist . Pain shot through his burned fingers .  What of my sisters?
The message made no mention of Lord Eddard or the girls.  He gave an irritated shrug .  Perhaps they never got my letter . Aemon sent two copies, with his best birds, but who can say? More like, Pycelle did not deign to reply . It would not be the first time, nor the last . I fear we count for less than nothing in King ’ s Landing . They tell us what they want us to know, and that ’ s little enough.
And you tell me what you want me to know, and that ’ s less, Jon thought resentfully . His brother Robb had called the banners and ridden south to war, yet no word of that had been breathed to him … save by Samwell Tarly, who ’ d read the letter to Maester Aemon and whispered its contents to Jon that night in secret, all the time saying how he shouldn ’ t . Doubtless they thought his brother ’ s war was none of his concern . It troubled him more than he could say . Robb was marching and he was not . No matter how often Jon told himself that his place was here now, with his new brothers on the Wall, he still felt craven.
Corn,  the raven was crying .  Corn, corn.
Oh, be quiet,  the Old Bear told it .  Snow, how soon does Maester Aemon say you ’ ll have use of that hand back?
Jon replied . [BOS] Soon, [EOS]
Good.  On the table between them, Lord Mormont laid a large sword in a black metal scabbard banded with silver .  Here . You ’ ll be ready for this, then.
The raven flapped down and landed on the table, strutting toward the sword, head cocked curiously . Jon hesitated . He had no inkling what this meant .  My lord?
The fire melted the silver off the pommel and burnt the crossguard and grip . Well, dry leather and old wood, what could you expect? The blade, now … you ’ d need a fire a hundred times as hot to harm the blade.  Mormont shoved the scabbard across the rough oak planks .  I had the rest made anew . Take it.
Take it,  echoed his raven, preening .  Take it, take it.
Awkwardly, Jon took the sword in hand . His left hand; his bandaged right was still too raw and clumsy . Carefully he pulled it from its scabbard and raised it level with his eyes.
The pommel was a hunk of pale stone weighted with lead to balance the long blade . It had been carved into the likeness of a snarling wolf ’ s head, with chips of garnet set into the eyes . The grip was virgin leather, soft and black, as yet unstained by sweat or blood . The blade itself was a good half foot longer than those Jon was used to, tapered to thrust as well as slash, with three fullers deeply incised in the metal . Where Ice was a true two-handed greatsword, this was a hand-and-a-halfer, sometimes named a  bastard sword.  Yet the wolf sword actually seemed lighter than the blades he had wielded before . When Jon turned it sideways, he could see the ripples in the dark steel where the metal had been folded back on itself again and again .  This is Valyrian steel, my lord,  he said wonderingly . His father had let him handle Ice often enough; he knew the look, the feel.
It is,  the Old Bear told him .  It was my father ’ s sword, and his father ’ s before him . The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries . I wielded it in my day and passed it on to my son when I took the black.
He is giving me his son ’ s sword . Jon could scarcely believe it . The blade was exquisitely balanced . The edges glimmered faintly as they kissed the light .  Your son—
My son brought dishonor to House Mormont, but at least he had the grace to leave the sword behind when he fled . My sister returned it to my keeping, but the very sight of it reminded me of Jorah ’ s shame, so I put it aside and thought no more of it until we found it in the ashes of my bedchamber . The original pommel was a bear ’ s head, silver, yet so worn its features were all but indistinguishable . For you, I thought a white wolf more apt . One of our builders is a fair stonecarver.
When Jon had been Bran ’ s age, he had dreamed of doing great deeds, as boys always did . The details of his feats changed with every dreaming, but quite often he imagined saving his father ’ s life . Afterward Lord Eddard would declare that Jon had proved himself a true Stark, and place Ice in his hand . Even then he had known it was only a child ’ s folly; no bastard could ever hope to wield a father ’ s sword . Even the memory shamed him . What kind of man stole his own brother ’ s birthright? I have no right to this, he thought, no more than to Ice . He twitched his burned fingers, feeling a throb of pain deep under the skin .  My lord, you honor me, but—
Spare me your but ’ s, boy,  Lord Mormont interrupted .  I would not be sitting here were it not for you and that beast of yours . You fought bravely … and more to the point, you thought quickly . Fire! Yes, damn it . We ought to have known . We ought to have remembered . The Long Night has come before . Oh, eight thousand years is a good while, to be sure … yet if the Night ’ s Watch does not remember, who will?
Who will,  chimed the talkative raven .  Who will.
Truly, the gods had heard Jon ’ s prayer that night; the fire had caught in the dead man ’ s clothing and consumed him as if his flesh were candle wax and his bones old dry wood . Jon had only to close his eyes to see the thing staggering across the solar, crashing against the furniture and flailing at the flames . It was the face that haunted him most; surrounded by a nimbus of fire, hair blazing like straw, the dead flesh melting away and sloughing off its skull to reveal the gleam of bone beneath.
Whatever demonic force moved Othor had been driven out by the flames; the twisted thing they had found in the ashes had been no more than cooked meat and charred bone . Yet in his nightmare he faced it again … and this time the burning corpse wore Lord Eddard ’ s features . It was his father ’ s skin that burst and blackened, his father ’ s eyes that ran liquid down his cheeks like jellied tears . Jon did not understand why that should be or what it might mean, but it frightened him more than he could say.
A sword ’ s small payment for a life,  Mormont concluded .  Take it, I ’ ll hear no more of it, is that understood?
Yes, my lord.  The soft leather gave beneath Jon ’ s fingers, as if the sword were molding itself to his grip already . He knew he should be honored, and he was, and yet …
He is not my father . The thought leapt unbidden to Jon ’ s mind . Lord Eddard Stark is my father . I will not forget him, no matter how many swords they give me . Yet he could scarcely tell Lord Mormont that it was another man ’ s sword he dreamt of …
I want no courtesies either,  Mormont said,  so thank me no thanks . Honor the steel with deeds, not words.
Jon nodded . [BOS] Does it have a name, my lord? [EOS]
It did, once . Longclaw, it was called.
Claw,  the raven cried .  Claw.
Jon tried a practice cut . He was clumsy and uncomfortable with his left hand, yet even so the steel seemed to flow through the air, as if it had a will of its own . [BOS] Longclaw is an apt name. Wolves have claws, as much as bears . [EOS]
The Old Bear seemed pleased by that .  I suppose they do . You ’ ll want to wear that over the shoulder, I imagine . It ’ s too long for the hip, at least until you ’ ve put on a few inches . And you ’ ll need to work at your two-handed strikes as well . Ser Endrew can show you some moves, when your burns have healed.
Ser Endrew?  Jon did not know the name.
Ser Endrew Tarth, a good man . He ’ s on his way from the Shadow Tower to assume the duties of master-at-arms . Ser Alliser Thorne left yestermorn for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
Jon lowered the sword . [BOS] Why? [EOS] he said, stupidly.
Mormont snorted .  Because I sent him, why do you think? He ’ s bringing the hand your Ghost tore off the end of Jafer Flowers ’ s wrist . I have commanded him to take ship to King ’ s Landing and lay it before this boy king . That should get young Joffrey ’ s attention, I ’ d think … and Ser Alliser ’ s a knight, highborn, anointed, with old friends at court, altogether harder to ignore than a glorified crow.
Crow.  Jon thought the raven sounded faintly indignant.
As well,  the Lord Commander continued, ignoring the bird ’ s protest,  it puts a thousand leagues twixt him and you without it seeming a rebuke.  He jabbed a finger up at Jon ’ s face .  And don ’ t think this means I approve of that nonsense in the common hall . Valor makes up for a fair amount of folly, but you ’ re not a boy anymore, however many years you ’ ve seen . That ’ s a man ’ s sword you have there, and it will take a man to wield her . I ’ ll expect you to act the part, henceforth.
Yes, my lord.  Jon slid the sword back into the silver-banded scabbard . If not the blade he would have chosen, it was nonetheless a noble gift, and freeing him from Alliser Thorne ’ s malignance was nobler still.
The Old Bear scratched at his chin .  I had forgotten how much a new beard itches,  he said .  Well, no help for that . Is that hand of yours healed enough to resume your duties?
Yes, my lord.
Good . The night will be cold, I ’ ll want hot spice wine . Find me a flagon of red, not too sour, and don ’ t skimp on the spices . And tell Hobb that if he sends me boiled mutton again I ’ m like to boil him . That last haunch was grey . Even the bird wouldn ’ t touch it.  He stroked the raven ’ s head with his thumb, and the bird made a contented quorking sound .  Away with you . I ’ ve work to do.
The guards smiled at him from their niches as he wound his way down the turret stair, carrying the sword in his good hand .  Sweet steel,  one man said .  You earned that, Snow,  another told him . Jon made himself smile back at them, but his heart was not in it . He knew he should be pleased, yet he did not feel it . His hand ached, and the taste of anger was in his mouth, though he could not have said who he was angry with or why.
A half dozen of his friends were lurking outside when he left the King ’ s Tower, where Lord Commander Mormont now made his residence . They ’ d hung a target on the granary doors, so they could seem to be honing their skills as archers, but he knew lurkers when he saw them . No sooner did he emerge than Pyp called out,  Well, come about, let ’ s have a look.
Jon said . [BOS] At what? [EOS]
Toad sidled close .  Your rosy butt cheeks, what else?
The sword,  Grenn stated .  We want to see the sword.
Jon raked them with an accusing look . [BOS] You knew . [EOS]
Pyp grinned .  We ’ re not all as dumb as Grenn.
You are so,  insisted Grenn .  You ’ re dumber.
Halder gave an apologetic shrug .  I helped Pate carve the stone for the pommel,  the builder said,  and your friend Sam bought the garnets in Mole ’ s Town.
We knew even before that, though,  Grenn said .  Rudge has been helping Donal Noye in the forge . He was there when the Old Bear brought him the burnt blade.
The sword!  Matt insisted . The others took up the chant .  The sword, the sword, the sword.
Jon unsheathed Longclaw and showed it to them, turning it this way and that so they could admire it . The bastard blade glittered in the pale sunlight, dark and deadly . [BOS] Valyrian steel, [EOS] he declared solemnly, trying to sound as pleased and proud as he ought to have felt.
I heard of a man who had a razor made of Valyrian steel,  declared Toad .  He cut his head off trying to shave.
Pyp grinned .  The Night ’ s Watch is thousands of years old,  he said,  but I ’ ll wager Lord Snow ’ s the first brother ever honored for burning down the Lord Commander ’ s Tower.
The others laughed, and even Jon had to smile . The fire he ’ d started had not, in truth, burned down that formidable stone tower, but it had done a fair job of gutting the interior of the top two floors, where the Old Bear had his chambers . No one seemed to mind that very much, since it had also destroyed Othor ’ s murderous corpse.
The other wight, the one-handed thing that had once been a ranger named Jafer Flowers, had also been destroyed, cut near to pieces by a dozen swords … but not before it had slain Ser Jaremy Rykker and four other men . Ser Jaremy had finished the job of hacking its head off, yet had died all the same when the headless corpse pulled his own dagger from its sheath and buried it in his bowels . Strength and courage did not avail much against foemen who would not fall because they were already dead; even arms and armor offered small protection.
That grim thought soured Jon ’ s fragile mood .  I need to see Hobb about the Old Bear ’ s supper,  he announced brusquely, sliding Longclaw back into its scabbard . His friends meant well, but they did not understand . It was not their fault, truly; they had not had to face Othor, they had not seen the pale glow of those dead blue eyes, had not felt the cold of those dead black fingers . Nor did they know of the fighting in the riverlands . How could they hope to comprehend? He turned away from them abruptly and strode off, sullen . Pyp called after him, but Jon paid him no mind.
They had moved him back to his old cell in tumbledown Hardin ’ s Tower after the fire, and it was there he returned . Ghost was curled up asleep beside the door, but he lifted his head at the sound of Jon ’ s boots . The direwolf ’ s red eyes were darker than garnets and wiser than men . Jon knelt, scratched his ear, and showed him the pommel of the sword .  Look . It ’ s you.
Ghost sniffed at his carved stone likeness and tried a lick . Jon smiled .  You ’ re the one deserves an honor,  he told the wolf … and suddenly he found himself remembering how he ’ d found him, that day in the late summer snow . They had been riding off with the other pups, but Jon had heard a noise and turned back, and there he was, white fur almost invisible against the drifts . He was all alone, he thought, apart from the others in the litter . He was different, so they drove him out.
Jon?  He looked up . Samwell Tarly stood rocking nervously on his heels . His cheeks were red, and he was wrapped in a heavy fur cloak that made him look ready for hibernation.
Sam.  Jon stood .  What is it? Do you want to see the sword?  If the others had known, no doubt Sam did too.
The fat boy shook his head .  I was heir to my father ’ s blade once,  he said mournfully .  Heartsbane . Lord Randyll let me hold it a few times, but it always scared me . It was Valyrian steel, beautiful but so sharp I was afraid I ’ d hurt one of my sisters . Dickon will have it now.  He wiped sweaty hands on his cloak .  I … ah … Maester Aemon wants to see you.
It was not time for his bandages to be changed . Jon frowned suspiciously .  Why?  he demanded . Sam looked miserable . That was answer enough .  You told him, didn ’ t you?  Jon said angrily .  You told him that you told me.
I … he … Jon, I didn ’ t want to … he asked … I mean … I think he knew, he sees things no one else sees …
Jon pointed out forcefully, disgusted . [BOS] He ’ s blind, I can find the way myself. [EOS] He left Sam standing there, openmouthed and quivering.
He found Maester Aemon up in the rookery, feeding the ravens . Clydas was with him, carrying a bucket of chopped meat as they shuffled from cage to cage .  Sam said you wanted me?
The maester nodded .  I did indeed . Clydas, give Jon the bucket . Perhaps he will be kind enough to assist me.  The hunched, pink-eyed brother handed Jon the bucket and scurried down the ladder .  Toss the meat into the cages,  Aemon instructed him .  The birds will do the rest.
Jon shifted the bucket to his right hand and thrust his left down into the bloody bits . The ravens began to scream noisily and fly at the bars, beating at the metal with night-black wings . The meat had been chopped into pieces no larger than a finger joint . He filled his fist and tossed the raw red morsels into the cage, and the squawking and squabbling grew hotter . Feathers flew as two of the larger birds fought over a choice piece . Quickly Jon grabbed a second handful and threw it in after the first . [BOS] Lord Mormont ’ s raven likes fruit and corn . [EOS]
He is a rare bird,  the maester said .  Most ravens will eat grain, but they prefer flesh . It makes them strong, and I fear they relish the taste of blood . In that they are like men … and like men, not all ravens are alike.
Jon had nothing to say to that . He threw meat, wondering why he ’ d been summoned . No doubt the old man would tell him, in his own good time . Maester Aemon was not a man to be hurried.
Doves and pigeons can also be trained to carry messages,  the maester went on,  though the raven is a stronger flyer, larger, bolder, far more clever, better able to defend itself against hawks … yet ravens are black, and they eat the dead, so some godly men abhor them . Baelor the Blessed tried to replace all the ravens with doves, did you know?  The maester turned his white eyes on Jon, smiling .  The Night ’ s Watch prefers ravens.
Jon ’ s fingers were in the bucket, blood up to the wrist . [BOS] Dywen says the wildlings call us crows, [EOS] he said uncertainly.
The crow is the raven ’ s poor cousin . They are both beggars in black, hated and misunderstood.
Jon wished he understood what they were talking about, and why . What did he care about ravens and doves? If the old man had something to say to him, why couldn ’ t he just say it?
Jon, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night ’ s Watch take no wives and father no children?  Maester Aemon asked.
Jon shrugged . [BOS] No. [EOS] He scattered more meat . The fingers of his left hand were slimy with blood, and his right throbbed from the weight of the bucket.
So they will not love,  the old man answered,  for love is the bane of honor, the death of duty.
That did not sound right to Jon, yet he said nothing . The maester was a hundred years old, and a high officer of the Night ’ s Watch; it was not his place to contradict him.
The old man seemed to sense his doubts .  Tell me, Jon, if the day should ever come when your lord father must needs choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?
Jon hesitated . He wanted to say that Lord Eddard would never dishonor himself, not even for love, yet inside a small sly voice whispered, He fathered a bastard, where was the honor in that? And your mother, what of his duty to her, he will not even say her name .  He would do whatever was right,  he said … ringingly, to make up for his hesitation .  No matter what.
Then Lord Eddard is a man in ten thousand . Most of us are not so strong . What is honor compared to a woman ’ s love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms … or the memory of a brother ’ s smile? Wind and words . Wind and words . We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love . That is our great glory, and our great tragedy.
The men who formed the Night ’ s Watch knew that only their courage shielded the realm from the darkness to the north . They knew they must have no divided loyalties to weaken their resolve . So they vowed they would have no wives nor children.
Yet brothers they had, and sisters . Mothers who gave them birth, fathers who gave them names . They came from a hundred quarrelsome kingdoms, and they knew times may change, but men do not . So they pledged as well that the Night ’ s Watch would take no part in the battles of the realms it guarded.
They kept their pledge . When Aegon slew Black Harren and claimed his kingdom, Harren ’ s brother was Lord Commander on the Wall, with ten thousand swords to hand . He did not march . In the days when the Seven Kingdoms were seven kingdoms, not a generation passed that three or four of them were not at war . The Watch took no part . When the Andals crossed the narrow sea and swept away the kingdoms of the First Men, the sons of the fallen kings held true to their vows and remained at their posts . So it has always been, for years beyond counting . Such is the price of honor.
A craven can be as brave as any man, when there is nothing to fear . And we all do our duty, when there is no cost to it . How easy it seems then, to walk the path of honor . Yet soon or late in every man ’ s life comes a day when it is not easy, a day when he must choose.
Some of the ravens were still eating, long stringy bits of meat dangling from their beaks . The rest seemed to be watching him . Jon could feel the weight of all those tiny black eyes .  And this is my day … is that what you ’ re saying?
Maester Aemon turned his head and looked at him with those dead white eyes . It was as if he were seeing right into his heart . Jon felt naked and exposed . He took the bucket in both hands and flung the rest of the slops through the bars . Strings of meat and blood flew everywhere, scattering the ravens . They took to the air, shrieking wildly . The quicker birds snatched morsels on the wing and gulped them down greedily . Jon let the empty bucket clang to the floor.
The old man laid a withered, spotted hand on his shoulder .  It hurts, boy,  he said softly .  Oh, yes . Choosing … it has always hurt . And always will . I know.
Jon said bitterly . [BOS] You don ’ t know, No one knows . Even if I am his bastard, he ’ s still my father … [EOS]
Maester Aemon sighed .  Have you heard nothing I ’ ve told you, Jon? Do you think you are the first?  He shook his ancient head, a gesture weary beyond words .  Three times the gods saw fit to test my vows . Once when I was a boy, once in the fullness of my manhood, and once when I had grown old . By then my strength was fled, my eyes grown dim, yet that last choice was as cruel as the first . My ravens would bring the news from the south, words darker than their wings, the ruin of my House, the death of my kin, disgrace and desolation . What could I have done, old, blind, frail? I was helpless as a suckling babe, yet still it grieved me to sit forgotten as they cut down my brother ’ s poor grandson, and his son, and even the little children …
Jon was shocked to see the shine of tears in the old man ’ s eyes . [BOS] Who are you? [EOS] he asked quietly, almost in dread.
A toothless smile quivered on the ancient lips .  Only a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night ’ s Watch . In my order, we put aside our house names when we take our vows and don the collar.  The old man touched the maester ’ s chain that hung loosely around his thin, fleshless neck .  My father was Maekar, the First of his Name, and my brother Aegon reigned after him in my stead . My grandfather named me for Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, who was his uncle, or his father, depending on which tale you believe . Aemon, he called me …
Aemon … Targaryen?  Jon could scarcely believe it.
Once,  the old man said .  Once . So you see, Jon, I do know … and knowing, I will not tell you stay or go . You must make that choice yourself, and live with it all the rest of your days . As I have.  His voice fell to a whisper .  As I have …
The mare whickered softly as Jon Snow tightened the cinch .  Easy, sweet lady,  he said in a soft voice, quieting her with a touch . Wind whispered through the stable, a cold dead breath on his face, but Jon paid it no mind . He strapped his roll to the saddle, his scarred fingers stiff and clumsy .  Ghost,  he called softly,  to me.  And the wolf was there, eyes like embers.
Jon, please . You must not do this.
He mounted, the reins in his hand, and wheeled the horse around to face the night . Samwell Tarly stood in the stable door, a full moon peering over his shoulder . He threw a giant ’ s shadow, immense and black .  Get out of my way, Sam.
Jon, you can ’ t,  Sam said .  I won ’ t let you.
Jon told him . [BOS] I would sooner not hurt you, Move aside, Sam, or I ’ ll ride you down . [EOS]
You won ’ t . You have to listen to me . Please …
Jon put his spurs to horseflesh, and the mare bolted for the door . For an instant Sam stood his ground, his face as round and pale as the moon behind him, his mouth a widening O of surprise . At the last moment, when they were almost on him, he jumped aside as Jon had known he would, stumbled, and fell . The mare leapt over him, out into the night.
Jon raised the hood of his heavy cloak and gave the horse her head . Castle Black was silent and still as he rode out, with Ghost racing at his side . Men watched from the Wall behind him, he knew, but their eyes were turned north, not south . No one would see him go, no one but Sam Tarly, struggling back to his feet in the dust of the old stables . He hoped Sam hadn ’ t hurt himself, falling like that . He was so heavy and so ungainly, it would be just like him to break a wrist or twist his ankle getting out of the way . Jon said aloud . [BOS] I warned him, It was nothing to do with him, anyway. [EOS] He flexed his burned hand as he rode, opening and closing the scarred fingers . They still pained him, but it felt good to have the wrappings off.
Moonlight silvered the hills as he followed the twisting ribbon of the kingsroad . He needed to get as far from the Wall as he could before they realized he was gone . On the morrow he would leave the road and strike out overland through field and bush and stream to throw off pursuit, but for the moment speed was more important than deception . It was not as though they would not guess where he was going.
The Old Bear was accustomed to rise at first light, so Jon had until dawn to put as many leagues as he could between him and the Wall … if Sam Tarly did not betray him . The fat boy was dutiful and easily frightened, but he loved Jon like a brother . If questioned, Sam would doubtless tell them the truth, but Jon could not imagine him braving the guards in front of the King ’ s Tower to wake Mormont from sleep.
When Jon did not appear to fetch the Old Bear ’ s breakfast from the kitchen, they ’ d look in his cell and find Longclaw on the bed . It had been hard to abandon it, but Jon was not so lost to honor as to take it with him . Even Jorah Mormont had not done that, when he fled in disgrace . Doubtless Lord Mormont would find someone more worthy of the blade . Jon felt bad when he thought of the old man . He knew his desertion would be salt in the still-raw wound of his son ’ s disgrace . That seemed a poor way to repay him for his trust, but it couldn ’ t be helped . No matter what he did, Jon felt as though he were betraying someone.
Even now, he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing . The southron had it easier . They had their septons to talk to, someone to tell them the gods ’ will and help sort out right from wrong . But the Starks worshiped the old gods, the nameless gods, and if the heart trees heard, they did not speak.
When the last lights of Castle Black vanished behind him, Jon slowed his mare to a walk . He had a long journey ahead and only the one horse to see him through . There were holdfasts and farming villages along the road south where he might be able to trade the mare for a fresh mount when he needed one, but not if she were injured or blown.
He would need to find new clothes soon; most like, he ’ d need to steal them . He was clad in black from head to heel; high leather riding boots, roughspun breeches and tunic, sleeveless leather jerkin, and heavy wool cloak . His longsword and dagger were sheathed in black moleskin, and the hauberk and coif in his saddlebag were black ringmail . Any bit of it could mean his death if he were taken . A stranger wearing black was viewed with cold suspicion in every village and holdfast north of the Neck, and men would soon be watching for him . Once Maester Aemon ’ s ravens took flight, Jon knew he would find no safe haven . Not even at Winterfell . Bran might want to let him in, but Maester Luwin had better sense . He would bar the gates and send Jon away, as he should . Better not to call there at all.
Yet he saw the castle clear in his mind ’ s eye, as if he had left it only yesterday; the towering granite walls, the Great Hall with its smells of smoke and dog and roasting meat, his father ’ s solar, the turret room where he had slept . Part of him wanted nothing so much as to hear Bran laugh again, to sup on one of Gage ’ s beef-and-bacon pies, to listen to Old Nan tell her tales of the children of the forest and Florian the Fool.
But he had not left the Wall for that; he had left because he was after all his father ’ s son, and Robb ’ s brother . The gift of a sword, even a sword as fine as Longclaw, did not make him a Mormont . Nor was he Aemon Targaryen . Three times the old man had chosen, and three times he had chosen honor, but that was him . Even now, Jon could not decide whether the maester had stayed because he was weak and craven, or because he was strong and true . Yet he understood what the old man had meant, about the pain of choosing; he understood that all too well.
Tyrion Lannister had claimed that most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, but Jon was done with denials . He was who he was; Jon Snow, bastard and oathbreaker, motherless, friendless, and damned . For the rest of his life—however long that might be—he would be condemned to be an outsider, the silent man standing in the shadows who dares not speak his true name . Wherever he might go throughout the Seven Kingdoms, he would need to live a lie, lest every man ’ s hand be raised against him . But it made no matter, so long as he lived long enough to take his place by his brother ’ s side and help avenge his father.
He remembered Robb as he had last seen him, standing in the yard with snow melting in his auburn hair . Jon would have to come to him in secret, disguised . He tried to imagine the look on Robb ’ s face when he revealed himself . His brother would shake his head and smile, and he ’ d say … he ’ d say …
He could not see the smile . Hard as he tried, he could not see it . He found himself thinking of the deserter his father had beheaded the day they ’ d found the direwolves .  You said the words,  Lord Eddard had told him .  You took a vow, before your brothers, before the old gods and the new.  Desmond and Fat Tom had dragged the man to the stump . Bran ’ s eyes had been wide as saucers, and Jon had to remind him to keep his pony in hand . He remembered the look on Father ’ s face when Theon Greyjoy brought forth Ice, the spray of blood on the snow, the way Theon had kicked the head when it came rolling at his feet.
He wondered what Lord Eddard might have done if the deserter had been his brother Benjen instead of that ragged stranger . Would it have been any different? It must, surely, surely … and Robb would welcome him, for a certainty . He had to, or else …
It did not bear thinking about . Pain throbbed, deep in his fingers, as he clutched the reins . Jon put his heels into his horse and broke into a gallop, racing down the kingsroad, as if to outrun his doubts . Jon was not afraid of death, but he did not want to die like that, trussed and bound and beheaded like a common brigand . If he must perish, let it be with a sword in his hand, fighting his father ’ s killers . He was no true Stark, had never been one … but he could die like one . Let them say that Eddard Stark had fathered four sons, not three.
Ghost kept pace with them for almost half a mile, red tongue lolling from his mouth . Man and horse alike lowered their heads as he asked the mare for more speed . The wolf slowed, stopped, watching, his eyes glowing red in the moonlight . He vanished behind, but Jon knew he would follow, at his own pace.
Scattered lights flickered through the trees ahead of him, on both sides of the road: Mole ’ s Town . A dog barked as he rode through, and he heard a mule ’ s raucous haw from the stable, but otherwise the village was still . Here and there the glow of hearth fires shone through shuttered windows, leaking between wooden slats, but only a few.
Mole ’ s Town was bigger than it seemed, but three quarters of it was under the ground, in deep warm cellars connected by a maze of tunnels . Even the whorehouse was down there, nothing on the surface but a wooden shack no bigger than a privy, with a red lantern hung over the door . On the Wall, he ’ d heard men call the whores  buried treasures.  He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down there tonight, mining . That was oathbreaking too, yet no one seemed to care.
Not until he was well beyond the village did Jon slow again . By then both he and the mare were damp with sweat . He dismounted, shivering, his burned hand aching . A bank of melting snow lay under the trees, bright in the moonlight, water trickling off to form small shallow pools . Jon squatted and brought his hands together, cupping the runoff between his fingers . The snowmelt was icy cold . He drank, and splashed some on his face, until his cheeks tingled . His fingers were throbbing worse than they had in days, and his head was pounding too . I am doing the right thing, he told himself, so why do I feel so bad?
The horse was well lathered, so Jon took the lead and walked her for a while . The road was scarcely wide enough for two riders to pass abreast, its surface cut by tiny streams and littered with stone . That run had been truly stupid, an invitation to a broken neck . Jon wondered what had gotten into him . Was he in such a great rush to die?
Off in the trees, the distant scream of some frightened animal made him look up . His mare whinnied nervously . Had his wolf found some prey? He cupped his hands around his mouth .  Ghost!  he shouted .  Ghost, to me.  The only answer was a rush of wings behind him as an owl took flight.
Frowning, Jon continued on his way . He led the mare for half an hour, until she was dry . Ghost did not appear . Jon wanted to mount up and ride again, but he was concerned about his missing wolf .  Ghost,  he called again .  Where are you? To me! Ghost!  Nothing in these woods could trouble a direwolf, even a half-grown direwolf, unless … no, Ghost was too smart to attack a bear, and if there was a wolf pack anywhere close Jon would have surely heard them howling.
He should eat, he decided . Food would settle his stomach and give Ghost the chance to catch up . There was no danger yet; Castle Black still slept . In his saddlebag, he found a biscuit, a piece of cheese, and a small withered brown apple . He ’ d brought salt beef as well, and a rasher of bacon he ’ d filched from the kitchens, but he would save the meat for the morrow . After it was gone he ’ d need to hunt, and that would slow him.
Jon sat under the trees and ate his biscuit and cheese while his mare grazed along the kingsroad . He kept the apple for last . It had gone a little soft, but the flesh was still tart and juicy . He was down to the core when he heard the sounds: horses, and from the north . Quickly Jon leapt up and strode to his mare . Could he outrun them? No, they were too close, they ’ d hear him for a certainty, and if they were from Castle Black …
He led the mare off the road, behind a thick stand of grey-green sentinels .  Quiet now,  he said in a hushed voice, crouching down to peer through the branches . If the gods were kind, the riders would pass by . Likely as not, they were only smallfolk from Mole ’ s Town, farmers on their way to their fields, although what they were doing out in the middle of the night …
He listened to the sound of hooves growing steadily louder as they trotted briskly down the kingsroad . From the sound, there were five or six of them at the least . Their voices drifted through the trees.
… certain he came this way?
We can ’ t be certain.
He could have ridden east, for all you know . Or left the road to cut through the woods . That ’ s what I ’ d do.
In the dark? Stupid . If you didn ’ t fall off your horse and break your neck, you ’ d get lost and wind up back at the Wall when the sun came up.
I would not.  Grenn sounded peeved .  I ’ d just ride south, you can tell south by the stars.
What if the sky was cloudy?  Pyp asked.
Then I wouldn ’ t go.
Another voice broke in .  You know where I ’ d be if it was me? I ’ d be in Mole ’ s Town, digging for buried treasure.  Toad ’ s shrill laughter boomed through the trees . Jon ’ s mare snorted.
Keep quiet, all of you,  Halder said .  I thought I heard something.
Where? I didn ’ t hear anything.  The horses stopped.
You can ’ t hear yourself fart.
I can too,  Grenn insisted.
They all fell silent, listening . Jon found himself holding his breath . Sam, he thought . He hadn ’ t gone to the Old Bear, but he hadn ’ t gone to bed either, he ’ d woken the other boys . Damn them all . Come dawn, if they were not in their beds, they ’ d be named deserters too . What did they think they were doing?
The hushed silence seemed to stretch on and on . From where Jon crouched, he could see the legs of their horses through the branches . Finally Pyp spoke up .  What did you hear?
I don ’ t know,  Halder admitted .  A sound, I thought it might have been a horse but …
There ’ s nothing here.
Out of the corner of his eye, Jon glimpsed a pale shape moving through the trees . Leaves rustled, and Ghost came bounding out of the shadows, so suddenly that Jon ’ s mare started and gave a whinny .  There!  Halder shouted.
I heard it too!
Jon told the direwolf as he swung up into the saddle . He turned the mare ’ s head to slide off through the trees, but they were on him before he had gone ten feet . [BOS] Traitor, [EOS]
Jon!  Pyp shouted after him.
Pull up,  Grenn said .  You can ’ t outrun us all.
Jon wheeled around to face them, drawing his sword . [BOS] Get back . I don ’ t wish to hurt you, but I will if I have to . [EOS]
One against seven?  Halder gave a signal . The boys spread out, surrounding him.
Jon demanded . [BOS] What do you want with me? [EOS]
We want to take you back where you belong,  Pyp said.
I belong with my brother.
We ’ re your brothers now,  Grenn said.
They ’ ll cut off your head if they catch you, you know,  Toad put in with a nervous laugh .  This is so stupid, it ’ s like something the Aurochs would do.
I would not,  Grenn said .  I ’ m no oathbreaker . I said the words and I meant them.
Jon told them . [BOS] So did I, Don ’ t you understand? They murdered my father . It ’ s war, my brother Robb is fighting in the riverlands— [EOS]
We know,  said Pyp solemnly .  Sam told us everything.
We ’ re sorry about your father,  Grenn said,  but it doesn ’ t matter . Once you say the words, you can ’ t leave, no matter what.
Jon said fervently . [BOS] I have to, [EOS]
You said the words,  Pyp reminded him .  Now my watch begins, you said it . It shall not end until my death.
I shall live and die at my post,  Grenn added, nodding.
You don ’ t have to tell me the words, I know them as well as you do.  He was angry now . Why couldn ’ t they let him go in peace? They were only making it harder.
I am the sword in the darkness,  Halder intoned.
The watcher on the walls,  piped Toad.
Jon cursed them all to their faces . They took no notice . Pyp spurred his horse closer, reciting, [BOS] I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men . [EOS]
Jon warned him, brandishing his sword . [BOS] Stay back, I mean it, Pyp. [EOS] They weren ’ t even wearing armor, he could cut them to pieces if he had to.
Matthar had circled behind him . He joined the chorus .  I pledge my life and honor to the Night ’ s Watch.
Jon kicked his mare, spinning her in a circle . The boys were all around him now, closing from every side.
For this night …,  Halder trotted in from the left.
… and all the nights to come,  finished Pyp . He reached over for Jon ’ s reins .  So here are your choices . Kill me, or come back with me.
Jon lifted his sword … and lowered it, helpless .  Damn you,  he said .  Damn you all.
Do we have to bind your hands, or will you give us your word you ’ ll ride back peaceful?  asked Halder.
I won ’ t run, if that ’ s what you mean.  Ghost moved out from under the trees and Jon glared at him .  Small help you were,  he said . The deep red eyes looked at him knowingly.
We had best hurry,  Pyp said .  If we ’ re not back before first light, the Old Bear will have all our heads.
Of the ride back, Jon Snow remembered little . It seemed shorter than the journey south, perhaps because his mind was elsewhere . Pyp set the pace, galloping, walking, trotting, and then breaking into another gallop . Mole ’ s Town came and went, the red lantern over the brothel long extinguished . They made good time . Dawn was still an hour off when Jon glimpsed the towers of Castle Black ahead of them, dark against the pale immensity of the Wall . It did not seem like home this time.
They could take him back, Jon told himself, but they could not make him stay . The war would not end on the morrow, or the day after, and his friends could not watch him day and night . He would bide his time, make them think he was content to remain here … and then, when they had grown lax, he would be off again . Next time he would avoid the kingsroad . He could follow the Wall east, perhaps all the way to the sea, a longer route but a safer one . Or even west, to the mountains, and then south over the high passes . That was the wildling ’ s way, hard and perilous, but at least no one would follow him . He wouldn ’ t stray within a hundred leagues of Winterfell or the kingsroad.
Samwell Tarly awaited them in the old stables, slumped on the ground against a bale of hay, too anxious to sleep . He rose and brushed himself off .  I … I ’ m glad they found you, Jon.
Jon said, dismounting . [BOS] I ’ m not, [EOS]
Pyp hopped off his horse and looked at the lightening sky with disgust .  Give us a hand bedding down the horses, Sam,  the small boy said .  We have a long day before us, and no sleep to face it on, thanks to Lord Snow.
When day broke, Jon walked to the kitchens as he did every dawn . Three-Finger Hobb said nothing as he gave him the Old Bear ’ s breakfast . Today it was three brown eggs boiled hard, with fried bread and ham steak and a bowl of wrinkled plums . Jon carried the food back to the King ’ s Tower . He found Mormont at the window seat, writing . His raven was walking back and forth across his shoulders, muttering,  Corn, corn, corn.  The bird shrieked when Jon entered .  Put the food on the table,  the Old Bear said, glancing up .  I ’ ll have some beer.
Jon opened a shuttered window, took the flagon of beer off the outside ledge, and filled a horn . Hobb had given him a lemon, still cold from the Wall . Jon crushed it in his fist . The juice trickled through his fingers . Mormont drank lemon in his beer every day, and claimed that was why he still had his own teeth.
Doubtless you loved your father,  Mormont said when Jon brought him his horn .  The things we love destroy us every time, lad . Remember when I told you that?
Jon said sullenly . He did not care to talk of his father ’ s death, not even to Mormont . [BOS] I remember, [EOS]
See that you never forget it . The hard truths are the ones to hold tight . Fetch me my plate . Is it ham again? So be it . You look weary . Was your moonlight ride so tiring?
Jon ’ s throat was dry . [BOS] You know? [EOS]
Know,  the raven echoed from Mormont ’ s shoulder .  Know.
The Old Bear snorted .  Do you think they chose me Lord Commander of the Night ’ s Watch because I ’ m dumb as a stump, Snow? Aemon told me you ’ d go . I told him you ’ d be back . I know my men … and my boys too . Honor set you on the kingsroad … and honor brought you back.
Jon said . [BOS] My friends brought me back, [EOS]
Did I say it was your honor?  Mormont inspected his plate.
They killed my father . Did you expect me to do nothing?
If truth be told, we expected you to do just as you did.  Mormont tried a plum, spit out the pit .  I ordered a watch kept over you . You were seen leaving . If your brothers had not fetched you back, you would have been taken along the way, and not by friends . Unless you have a horse with wings like a raven . Do you?
Jon felt like a fool . [BOS] No. [EOS]
Pity, we could use a horse like that.
Jon stood tall . He told himself that he would die well; that much he could do, at the least . [BOS] I know the penalty for desertion, my lord . I ’ m not afraid to die . [EOS]
Die!  the raven cried.
Nor live, I hope,  Mormont said, cutting his ham with a dagger and feeding a bite to the bird .  You have not deserted—yet . Here you stand . If we beheaded every boy who rode to Mole ’ s Town in the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall . Yet maybe you mean to flee again on the morrow, or a fortnight from now . Is that it? Is that your hope, boy?
Jon kept silent.
I thought so.  Mormont peeled the shell off a boiled egg .  Your father is dead, lad . Do you think you can bring him back?
No,  he answered, sullen.
Good,  Mormont said .  We ’ ve seen the dead come back, you and me, and it ’ s not something I care to see again.  He ate the egg in two bites and flicked a bit of shell out from between his teeth .  Your brother is in the field with all the power of the north behind him . Any one of his lords bannermen commands more swords than you ’ ll find in all the Night ’ s Watch . Why do you imagine that they need your help? Are you such a mighty warrior, or do you carry a grumkin in your pocket to magic up your sword?
Jon had no answer for him . The raven was pecking at an egg, breaking the shell . Pushing his beak through the hole, he pulled out morsels of white and yoke.
The Old Bear sighed .  You are not the only one touched by this war . Like as not, my sister is marching in your brother ’ s host, her and those daughters of hers, dressed in men ’ s mail . Maege is a hoary old snark, stubborn, short-tempered, and willful . Truth be told, I can hardly stand to be around the wretched woman, but that does not mean my love for her is any less than the love you bear your half sisters.  Frowning, Mormont took his last egg and squeezed it in his fist until the shell crunched .  Or perhaps it does . Be that as it may, I ’ d still grieve if she were slain, yet you don ’ t see me running off . I said the words, just as you did . My place is here … where is yours, boy?
I have no place, Jon wanted to say, I ’ m a bastard, I have no rights, no name, no mother, and now not even a father . The words would not come .  I don ’ t know.
I do,  said Lord Commander Mormont .  The cold winds are rising, Snow . Beyond the Wall, the shadows lengthen . Cotter Pyke writes of vast herds of elk, streaming south and east toward the sea, and mammoths as well . He says one of his men discovered huge, misshapen footprints not three leagues from Eastwatch . Rangers from the Shadow Tower have found whole villages abandoned, and at night Ser Denys says they see fires in the mountains, huge blazes that burn from dusk till dawn . Quorin Halfhand took a captive in the depths of the Gorge, and the man swears that Mance Rayder is massing all his people in some new, secret stronghold he ’ s found, to what end the gods only know . Do you think your uncle Benjen was the only ranger we ’ ve lost this past year?
Ben Jen,  the raven squawked, bobbing its head, bits of egg dribbling from its beak .  Ben Jen . Ben Jen.
Jon said . There had been others . Too many . [BOS] No, [EOS]
Do you think your brother ’ s war is more important than ours?  the old man barked.
Jon chewed his lip . The raven flapped its wings at him . [BOS] War, war, war, war, [EOS] it sang.
It ’ s not,  Mormont told him .  Gods save us, boy, you ’ re not blind and you ’ re not stupid . When dead men come hunting in the night, do you think it matters who sits the Iron Throne?
No.  Jon had not thought of it that way.
Your lord father sent you to us, Jon . Why, who can say?
Why? Why? Why?  the raven called.
All I know is that the blood of the First Men flows in the veins of the Starks . The First Men built the Wall, and it ’ s said they remember things otherwise forgotten . And that beast of yours … he led us to the wights, warned you of the dead man on the steps . Ser Jaremy would doubtless call that happenstance, yet Ser Jaremy is dead and I ’ m not.  Lord Mormont stabbed a chunk of ham with the point of his dagger .  I think you were meant to be here, and I want you and that wolf of yours with us when we go beyond the Wall.
His words sent a chill of excitement down Jon ’ s back .  Beyond the Wall?
You heard me . I mean to find Ben Stark, alive or dead.  He chewed and swallowed .  I will not sit here meekly and wait for the snows and the ice winds . We must know what is happening . This time the Night ’ s Watch will ride in force, against the King-beyond-the-Wall, the Others, and anything else that may be out there . I mean to command them myself.  He pointed his dagger at Jon ’ s chest .  By custom, the Lord Commander ’ s steward is his squire as well … but I do not care to wake every dawn wondering if you ’ ve run off again . So I will have an answer from you, Lord Snow, and I will have it now . Are you a brother of the Night ’ s Watch … or only a bastard boy who wants to play at war?
Jon Snow straightened himself and took a long deep breath . Forgive me, Father . Robb, Arya, Bran … forgive me, I cannot help you . He has the truth of it . This is my place . [BOS] I am … yours, my lord . Your man . I swear it . I will not run again . [EOS]
The Old Bear snorted .  Good . Now go put on your sword.
Sam?  Jon called softly.
The air smelled of paper and dust and years . Before him, tall wooden shelves rose up into dimness, crammed with leatherbound books and bins of ancient scrolls . A faint yellow glow filtered through the stacks from some hidden lamp . Jon blew out the taper he carried, preferring not to risk an open flame amidst so much old dry paper . Instead he followed the light, wending his way down the narrow aisles beneath barrel-vaulted ceilings . All in black, he was a shadow among shadows, dark of hair, long of face, grey of eye . Black moleskin gloves covered his hands; the right because it was burned, the left because a man felt half a fool wearing only one glove.
Samwell Tarly sat hunched over a table in a niche carved into the stone of the wall . The glow came from the lamp hung over his head . He looked up at the sound of Jon ’ s steps.
Have you been here all night?
Have I?  Sam looked startled.
You didn ’ t break your fast with us, and your bed hadn ’ t been slept in.  Rast suggested that maybe Sam had deserted, but Jon never believed it . Desertion required its own sort of courage, and Sam had little enough of that.
Is it morning? Down here there ’ s no way to know.
Jon said . [BOS] Sam, you ’ re a sweet fool, You ’ ll miss that bed when we ’ re sleeping on the cold hard ground, I promise you . [EOS]
Sam yawned .  Maester Aemon sent me to find maps for the Lord Commander . I never thought . . . Jon, the books, have you ever seen their like? There are thousands!
He gazed about him .  The library at Winterfell has more than a hundred . Did you find the maps?
Oh, yes.  Sam ’ s hand swept over the table, fingers plump as sausages indicating the clutter of books and scrolls before him .  A dozen, at the least.  He unfolded a square of parchment .  The paint has faded, but you can see where the mapmaker marked the sites of wildling villages, and there ’ s another book . . . where is it now? I was reading it a moment ago.  He shoved some scrolls aside to reveal a dusty volume bound in rotted leather .  This,  he said reverently,  is the account of a journey from the Shadow Tower all the way to Lorn Point on the Frozen Shore, written by a ranger named Redwyn . It ’ s not dated, but he mentions a Dorren Stark as King in the North, so it must be from before the Conquest . Jon, they fought giants! Redwyn even traded with the children of the forest, it ’ s all here.  Ever so delicately, he turned pages with a finger .  He drew maps as well, see . . .
Maybe you could write an account of our ranging, Sam.
He ’ d meant to sound encouraging, but it was the wrong thing to say . The last thing Sam needed was to be reminded of what faced them on the morrow . He shuffled the scrolls about aimlessly .  There ’ s more maps . If I had time to search . . . everything ’ s a jumble . I could set it all to order, though; I know I could, but it would take time . . . well, years, in truth.
Jon plucked a scroll from a bin, blew off the worst of the dust . A corner flaked off between his fingers as he unrolled it . [BOS] Mormont wanted those maps a little sooner than that. Look, this one is crumbling, [EOS] he said, frowning over the faded script.
Be gentle.  Sam came around the table and took the scroll from his hand, holding it as if it were a wounded animal .  The important books used to be copied over when they needed them . Some of the oldest have been copied half a hundred times, probably.
Well, don ’ t bother copying that one . Twenty-three barrels of pickled cod, eighteen jars of fish oil, a cask of salt . . .
An inventory,  Sam said,  or perhaps a bill of sale.
Jon wondered . [BOS] Who cares how much pickled cod they ate six hundred years ago? [EOS]
I would.  Sam carefully replaced the scroll in the bin from which Jon had plucked it .  You can learn so much from ledgers like that, truly you can . It can tell you how many men were in the Night ’ s Watch then, how they lived, what they ate . . .
They ate food,  said Jon,  and they lived as we live.
You ’ d be surprised . This vault is a treasure, Jon.
If you say so.  Jon was doubtful . Treasure meant gold, silver, and jewels, not dust, spiders, and rotting leather.
I do,  the fat boy blurted . He was older than Jon, a man grown by law, but it was hard to think of him as anything but a boy .  I found drawings of the faces in the trees, and a book about the tongue of the children of the forest . . . works that even the Citadel doesn ’ t have, scrolls from old Valyria, counts of the seasons written by maesters dead a thousand years . . .
The books will still be here when we return.
If we return . . .
The Old Bear is taking two hundred seasoned men, three-quarters of them rangers . Qhorin Halfhand will be bringing another hundred brothers from the Shadow Tower . You ’ ll be as safe as if you were back in your lord father ’ s castle at Horn Hill.
Samwell Tarly managed a sad little smile .  I was never very safe in my father ’ s castle either.
The gods play cruel jests, Jon thought . Pyp and Toad, all a lather to be a part of the great ranging, were to remain at Castle Black . It was Samwell Tarly, the self-proclaimed coward, grossly fat, timid, and near as bad a rider as he was with a sword, who must face the haunted forest . The Old Bear was taking two cages of ravens, so they might send back word as they went . Maester Aemon was blind and far too frail to ride with them, so his steward must go in his place .  We need you for the ravens, Sam . And someone has to help me keep Grenn humble.
Sam ’ s chins quivered .  You could care for the ravens, or Grenn could, or anyone,  he said with a thin edge of desperation in his voice .  I could show you how . You know your letters too, you could write down Lord Mormont ’ s messages as well as I.
I ’ m the Old Bear ’ s steward . I ’ ll need to squire for him, tend his horse, set up his tent; I won ’ t have time to watch over birds as well . Sam, you said the words . You ’ re a brother of the Night ’ s Watch now.
A brother of the Night ’ s Watch shouldn ’ t be so scared.
We ’ re all scared . We ’ d be fools if we weren ’ t.  Too many rangers had been lost the past two years, even Benjen Stark, Jon ’ s uncle . They had found two of his uncle ’ s men in the wood, slain, but the corpses had risen in the chill of night . Jon ’ s burnt fingers twitched as he remembered . He still saw the wight in his dreams, dead Othor with the burning blue eyes and the cold black hands, but that was the last thing Sam needed to be reminded of .  There ’ s no shame in fear, my father told me, what matters is how we face it . Come, I ’ ll help you gather up the maps.
Sam nodded unhappily . The shelves were so closely spaced that they had to walk single file as they left . The vault opened onto one of the tunnels the brothers called the wormwalks, winding subterranean passages that linked the keeps and towers of Castle Black under the earth . In summer the wormwalks were seldom used, save by rats and other vermin, but winter was a different matter . When the snows drifted forty and fifty feet high and the ice winds came howling out of the north, the tunnels were all that held Castle Black together.
Soon, Jon thought as they climbed . He ’ d seen the harbinger that had come to Maester Aemon with word of summer ’ s end, the great raven of the Citadel, white and silent as Ghost . He had seen a winter once, when he was very young, but everyone agreed that it had been a short one, and mild . This one would be different . He could feel it in his bones.
The steep stone steps had Sam puffing like a blacksmith ’ s bellows by the time they reached the surface . They emerged into a brisk wind that made Jon ’ s cloak swirl and snap . Ghost was stretched out asleep beneath the wattle-and-daub wall of the granary, but he woke when Jon appeared, bushy white tail held stiffly upright as he trotted to them.
Sam squinted up at the Wall . It loomed above them, an icy cliff seven hundred feet high . Sometimes it seemed to Jon almost a living thing, with moods of its own . The color of the ice was wont to change with every shift of the light . Now it was the deep blue of frozen rivers, now the dirty white of old snow, and when a cloud passed before the sun it darkened to the pale grey of pitted stone . The Wall stretched east and west as far as the eye could see, so huge that it shrunk the timbered keeps and stone towers of the castle to insignificance . It was the end of the world.
And we are going beyond it.
The morning sky was streaked by thin grey clouds, but the pale red line was there behind them . The black brothers had dubbed the wanderer Mormont ’ s Torch, saying (only half in jest) that the gods must have sent it to light the old man ’ s way through the haunted forest.
The comet ’ s so bright you can see it by day now,  Sam said, shading his eyes with a fistful of books.
Never mind about comets, it ’ s maps the Old Bear wants.
Ghost loped ahead of them . The grounds seemed deserted this morning, with so many rangers off at the brothel in Mole ’ s Town, digging for buried treasure and drinking themselves blind . Grenn had gone with them . Pyp and Halder and Toad had offered to buy him his first woman to celebrate his first ranging . They ’ d wanted Jon and Sam to come as well, but Sam was almost as frightened of whores as he was of the haunted forest, and Jon had wanted no part of it .  Do what you want,  he told Toad,  I took a vow.
As they passed the sept, he heard voices raised in song . Some men want whores on the eve of battle, and some want gods . Jon wondered who felt better afterward . The sept tempted him no more than the brothel; his own gods kept their temples in the wild places, where the weirwoods spread their bone-white branches . The Seven have no power beyond the Wall, he thought, but my gods will be waiting.
Outside the armory, Ser Endrew Tarth was working with some raw recruits . They ’ d come in last night with Conwy, one of the wandering crows who roamed the Seven Kingdoms collecting men for the Wall . This new crop consisted of a greybeard leaning on a staff, two blond boys with the look of brothers, a foppish youth in soiled satin, a raggy man with a clubfoot, and some grinning loon who must have fancied himself a warrior . Ser Endrew was showing him the error of that presumption . He was a gentler master-at-arms than Ser Alliser Thorne had been, but his lessons would still raise bruises . Sam winced at every blow, but Jon Snow watched the swordplay closely.
What do you make of them, Snow?  Donal Noye stood in the door of his armory, bare-chested under a leather apron, the stump of his left arm uncovered for once . With his big gut and barrel chest, his flat nose and bristly black jaw, Noye did not make a pretty sight, but he was a welcome one nonetheless . The armorer had proved himself a good friend.
Jon said as Ser Endrew bullrushed his foe and knocked him sprawling . [BOS] They smell of summer, Where did Conwy find them? [EOS]
A lord ’ s dungeon near Gulltown,  the smith replied .  A brigand, a barber, a beggar, two orphans, and a boy whore . With such do we defend the realms of men.
They ’ ll do.  Jon gave Sam a private smile .  We did.
Noye drew him closer .  You ’ ve heard these tidings of your brother?
Last night.  Conwy and his charges had brought the news north with them, and the talk in the common room had been of little else . Jon was still not certain how he felt about it . Robb a king? The brother he ’ d played with, fought with, shared his first cup of wine with? But not mother ’ s milk, no . So now Robb will sip summerwine from jeweled goblets, while I ’ m kneeling beside some stream sucking snowmelt from cupped hands .  Robb will make a good king,  he said loyally.
Will he now?  The smith eyed him frankly .  I hope that ’ s so, boy, but once I might have said the same of Robert.
Jon remembered . [BOS] They say you forged his warhammer, [EOS]
Aye . I was his man, a Baratheon man, smith and armorer at Storm ’ s End until I lost the arm . I ’ m old enough to remember Lord Steffon before the sea took him, and I knew those three sons of his since they got their names . I tell you this—Robert was never the same after he put on that crown . Some men are like swords, made for fighting . Hang them up and they go to rust.
Jon asked . [BOS] And his brothers? [EOS]
The armorer considered that a moment .  Robert was the true steel . Stannis is pure iron, black and hard and strong, yes, but brittle, the way iron gets . He ’ ll break before he bends . And Renly, that one, he ’ s copper, bright and shiny, pretty to look at but not worth all that much at the end of the day.
And what metal is Robb? Jon did not ask . Noye was a Baratheon man; likely he thought Joffrey the lawful king and Robb a traitor . Among the brotherhood of the Night ’ s Watch, there was an unspoken pact never to probe too deeply into such matters . Men came to the Wall from all of the Seven Kingdoms, and old loves and loyalties were not easily forgotten, no matter how many oaths a man swore . . . as Jon himself had good reason to know . Even Sam—his father ’ s House was sworn to Highgarden, whose Lord Tyrell supported King Renly . Best not to talk of such things . The Night ’ s Watch took no sides . Jon said . [BOS] Lord Mormont awaits us, [EOS]
I won ’ t keep you from the Old Bear.  Noye clapped him on the shoulder and smiled .  May the gods go with you on the morrow, Snow . You bring back that uncle of yours, you hear?
Jon promised him . [BOS] We will, [EOS]
Lord Commander Mormont had taken up residence in the King ’ s Tower after the fire had gutted his own . Jon left Ghost with the guards outside the door .  More stairs,  said Sam miserably as they started up .  I hate stairs.
Well, that ’ s one thing we won ’ t face in the wood.
When they entered the solar, the raven spied them at once .  Snow!  the bird shrieked . Mormont broke off his conversation .  Took you long enough with those maps.  He pushed the remains of breakfast out of the way to make room on the table .  Put them here . I ’ ll have a look at them later.
Thoren Smallwood, a sinewy ranger with a weak chin and a weaker mouth hidden under a thin scraggle of beard, gave Jon and Sam a cool look . He had been one of Alliser Thorne ’ s henchmen, and had no love for either of them .  The Lord Commander ’ s place is at Castle Black, lording and commanding,  he told Mormont, ignoring the newcomers,  it seems to me.
The raven flapped big black wings .  Me, me, me.
If you are ever Lord Commander, you may do as you please,  Mormont told the ranger,  but it seems to me that I have not died yet, nor have the brothers put you in my place.
I ’ m First Ranger now, with Ben Stark lost and Ser Jaremy killed,  Smallwood said stubbornly .  The command should be mine.
Mormont would have none of it .  I sent out Ben Stark, and Ser Waymar before him . I do not mean to send you after them and sit wondering how long I must wait before I give you up for lost as well.  He pointed .  And Stark remains First Ranger until we know for a certainty that he is dead . Should that day come, it will be me who names his successor, not you . Now stop wasting my time . We ride at first light, or have you forgotten?
Smallwood pushed to his feet .  As my lord commands.  On the way out, he frowned at Jon, as if it were somehow his fault.
First Ranger!  The Old Bear ’ s eyes lighted on Sam .  I ’ d sooner name you First Ranger . He has the effrontery to tell me to my face that I ’ m too old to ride with him . Do I look old to you, boy?  The hair that had retreated from Mormont ’ s spotted scalp had regrouped beneath his chin in a shaggy grey beard that covered much of his chest . He thumped it hard .  Do I look frail?
Sam opened his mouth, gave a little squeak . The Old Bear terrified him . Jon offered quickly . [BOS] No, my lord, You look strong as a . . . a . . . [EOS]
Don ’ t cozen me, Snow, you know I won ’ t have it . Let me have a look at these maps.  Mormont pawed through them brusquely, giving each no more than a glance and a grunt .  Was this all you could find?
I . . . m-m-my lord,  Sam stammered,  there . . . there were more, b-b-but . . . the dis-disorder . . .
These are old,  Mormont complained, and his raven echoed him with a sharp cry of  Old, old.
Jon pointed out . [BOS] The villages may come and go, but the hills and rivers will be in the same places, [EOS]
True enough . Have you chosen your ravens yet, Tarly?
M-m-maester Aemon m-means to p-pick them come evenfall, after the f-f-feeding.
I ’ ll have his best . Smart birds, and strong.
Strong,  his own bird said, preening .  Strong, strong.
If it happens that we ’ re all butchered out there, I mean for my successor to know where and how we died.
Talk of butchery reduced Samwell Tarly to speechlessness . Mormont leaned forward .  Tarly, when I was a lad half your age, my lady mother told me that if I stood about with my mouth open, a weasel was like to mistake it for his lair and run down my throat . If you have something to say, say it . Otherwise, beware of weasels.  He waved a brusque dismissal .  Off with you, I ’ m too busy for folly . No doubt the maester has some work you can do.
Sam swallowed, stepped back, and scurried out so quickly he almost tripped over the rushes.
Is that boy as big a fool as he seems?  the Lord Commander asked when he ’ d gone .  Fool,  the raven complained . Mormont did not wait for Jon to answer .  His lord father stands high in King Renly ’ s councils, and I had half a notion to dispatch him . . . no, best not . Renly is not like to heed a quaking fat boy . I ’ ll send Ser Arnell . He ’ s a deal steadier, and his mother was one of the green-apple Fossoways.
If it please my lord, what would you have of King Renly?
The same things I ’ d have of all of them, lad . Men, horses, swords, armor, grain, cheese, wine, wool, nails . . . the Night ’ s Watch is not proud, we take what is offered.  His fingers drummed against the rough-hewn planks of the table .  If the winds have been kind, Ser Alliser should reach King ’ s Landing by the turn of the moon, but whether this boy Joffrey will pay him any heed, I do not know . House Lannister has never been a friend to the Watch.
Thorne has the wight ’ s hand to show them.  A grisly pale thing with black fingers, it was, that twitched and stirred in its jar as if it were still alive.
Would that we had another hand to send to Renly.
Dywen says you can find anything beyond the Wall.
Aye, Dywen says . And the last time he went ranging, he says he saw a bear fifteen feet tall.  Mormont snorted .  My sister is said to have taken a bear for her lover . I ’ d believe that before I ’ d believe one fifteen feet tall . Though in a world where dead come walking . . . ah, even so, a man must believe his eyes . I have seen the dead walk . I ’ ve not seen any giant bears.  He gave Jon a long, searching look .  But we were speaking of hands . How is yours?
Jon peeled off his moleskin glove and showed him . Scars covered his arm halfway to the elbow, and the mottled pink flesh still felt tight and tender, but it was healing . [BOS] Better. It itches, though . Maester Aemon says that ’ s good . He gave me a salve to take with me when we ride . [EOS]
You can wield Longclaw despite the pain?
Jon flexed his fingers, opening and closing his fist the way the maester had shown him . [BOS] Well enough. I ’ m to work the fingers every day to keep them nimble, as Maester Aemon said . [EOS]
Blind he may be, but Aemon knows what he ’ s about . I pray the gods let us keep him another twenty years . Do you know that he might have been king?
Jon was taken by surprise . [BOS] He told me his father was king, but not . . . I thought him perhaps a younger son . [EOS]
So he was . His father ’ s father was Daeron Targaryen, the Second of His Name, who brought Dorne into the realm . Part of the pact was that he wed a Dornish princess . She gave him four sons . Aemon ’ s father Maekar was the youngest of those, and Aemon was his third son . Mind you, all this happened long before I was born, ancient as Smallwood would make me.
Maester Aemon was named for the Dragonknight.
So he was . Some say Prince Aemon was King Daeron ’ s true father, not Aegon the Unworthy . Be that as it may, our Aemon lacked the Dragonknight ’ s martial nature . He likes to say he had a slow sword but quick wits . Small wonder his grandfather packed him off to the Citadel . He was nine or ten, I believe . . . and ninth or tenth in the line of succession as well.
Maester Aemon had counted more than a hundred name days, Jon knew . Frail, shrunken, wizened, and blind, it was hard to imagine him as a little boy no older than Arya.
Mormont continued .  Aemon was at his books when the eldest of his uncles, the heir apparent, was slain in a tourney mishap . He left two sons, but they followed him to the grave not long after, during the Great Spring Sickness . King Daeron was also taken, so the crown passed to Daeron ’ s second son, Aerys.
The Mad King?  Jon was confused . Aerys had been king before Robert, that wasn ’ t so long ago.
No, this was Aerys the First . The one Robert deposed was the second of that name.
How long ago was this?
Eighty years or close enough,  the Old Bear said,  and no, I still hadn ’ t been born, though Aemon had forged half a dozen links of his maester ’ s chain by then . Aerys wed his own sister, as the Targaryens were wont to do, and reigned for ten or twelve years . Aemon took his vows and left the Citadel to serve at some lordling ’ s court . . . until his royal uncle died without issue . The Iron Throne passed to the last of King Daeron ’ s four sons . That was Maekar, Aemon ’ s father . The new king summoned all his sons to court and would have made Aemon part of his councils, but he refused, saying that would usurp the place rightly belonging to the Grand Maester . Instead he served at the keep of his eldest brother, another Daeron . Well, that one died too, leaving only a feeble-witted daughter as heir . Some pox he caught from a whore, I believe . The next brother was Aerion.
Aerion the Monstrous?  Jon knew that name .  The Prince Who Thought He Was a Dragon  was one of Old Nan ’ s more gruesome tales . His little brother Bran had loved it.
The very one, though he named himself Aerion Brightflame . One night, in his cups, he drank a jar of wildfire, after telling his friends it would transform him into a dragon, but the gods were kind and it transformed him into a corpse . Not quite a year after, King Maekar died in battle against an outlaw lord.
Jon was not entirely innocent of the history of the realm; his own maester had seen to that .  That was the year of the Great Council,  he said .  The lords passed over Prince Aerion ’ s infant son and Prince Daeron ’ s daughter and gave the crown to Aegon.
Yes and no . First they offered it, quietly, to Aemon . And quietly he refused . The gods meant for him to serve, not to rule, he told them . He had sworn a vow and would not break it, though the High Septon himself offered to absolve him . Well, no sane man wanted any blood of Aerion ’ s on the throne, and Daeron ’ s girl was a lackwit besides being female, so they had no choice but to turn to Aemon ’ s younger brother—Aegon, the Fifth of His Name . Aegon the Unlikely, they called him, born the fourth son of a fourth son . Aemon knew, and rightly, that if he remained at court those who disliked his brother ’ s rule would seek to use him, so he came to the Wall . And here he has remained, while his brother and his brother ’ s son and his son each reigned and died in turn, until Jaime Lannister put an end to the line of the Dragonkings.
King,  croaked the raven . The bird flapped across the solar to land on Mormont ’ s shoulder .  King,  it said again, strutting back and forth.
Jon said, smiling . [BOS] He likes that word, [EOS]
An easy word to say . An easy word to like.
King,  the bird said again.
I think he means for you to have a crown, my lord.
The realm has three kings already, and that ’ s two too many for my liking.  Mormont stroked the raven under the beak with a finger, but all the while his eyes never left Jon Snow.
It made him feel odd .  My lord, why have you told me this, about Maester Aemon?
Must I have a reason?  Mormont shifted in his seat, frowning .  Your brother Robb has been crowned King in the North . You and Aemon have that in common . A king for a brother.
And this too,  said Jon .  A vow.
The Old Bear gave a loud snort, and the raven took flight, flapping in a circle about the room .  Give me a man for every vow I ’ ve seen broken and the Wall will never lack for defenders.
I ’ ve always known that Robb would be Lord of Winterfell.
Mormont gave a whistle, and the bird flew to him again and settled on his arm .  A lord ’ s one thing, a king ’ s another.  He offered the raven a handful of corn from his pocket .  They will garb your brother Robb in silks, satins, and velvets of a hundred different colors, while you live and die in black ringmail . He will wed some beautiful princess and father sons on her . You ’ ll have no wife, nor will you ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms . Robb will rule, you will serve . Men will call you a crow . Him they ’ ll call Your Grace . Singers will praise every little thing he does, while your greatest deeds all go unsung . Tell me that none of this troubles you, Jon . . . and I ’ ll name you a liar, and know I have the truth of it.
Jon drew himself up, taut as a bowstring . [BOS] And if it did trouble me, what might I do, bastard as I am? [EOS]
What will you do?  Mormont asked .  Bastard as you are?
Be troubled,  said Jon,  and keep my vows.
Whitetree, the village was named on Sam ’ s old maps . Jon did not think it much of a village . Four tumbledown one-room houses of unmortared stone surrounded an empty sheepfold and a well . The houses were roofed with sod, the windows shuttered with ragged pieces of hide . And above them loomed the pale limbs and dark red leaves of a monstrous great weirwood.
It was the biggest tree Jon Snow had ever seen, the trunk near eight feet wide, the branches spreading so far that the entire village was shaded beneath their canopy . The size did not disturb him so much as the face . . . the mouth especially, no simple carved slash, but a jagged hollow large enough to swallow a sheep.
Those are not sheep bones, though . Nor is that a sheep ’ s skull in the ashes.
An old tree.  Mormont sat his horse, frowning .  Old,  his raven agreed from his shoulder .  Old, old, old.
And powerful.  Jon could feel the power.
Thoren Smallwood dismounted beside the trunk, dark in his plate and mail .  Look at that face . Small wonder men feared them, when they first came to Westeros . I ’ d like to take an axe to the bloody thing myself.
Jon said, [BOS] My lord father believed no man could tell a lie in front of a heart tree . The old gods know when men are lying . [EOS]
My father believed the same,  said the Old Bear .  Let me have a look at that skull.
Jon dismounted . Slung across his back in a black leather shoulder sheath was Longclaw, the hand-and-a-half bastard blade the Old Bear had given him for saving his life . A bastard sword for a bastard, the men joked . The hilt had been fashioned new for him, adorned with a wolf ’ s-head pommel in pale stone, but the blade itself was Valyrian steel, old and light and deadly sharp.
He knelt and reached a gloved hand down into the maw . The inside of the hollow was red with dried sap and blackened by fire . Beneath the skull he saw another, smaller, the jaw broken off . It was half-buried in ash and bits of bone.
When he brought the skull to Mormont, the Old Bear lifted it in both hands and stared into the empty sockets .  The wildlings burn their dead . We ’ ve always known that . Now I wished I ’ d asked them why, when there were still a few around to ask.
Jon Snow remembered the wight rising, its eyes shining blue in the pale dead face . He knew why, he was certain.
Would that bones could talk,  the Old Bear grumbled .  This fellow could tell us much . How he died . Who burned him, and why . Where the wildlings have gone.  He sighed .  The children of the forest could speak to the dead, it ’ s said . But I can ’ t.  He tossed the skull back into the mouth of the tree, where it landed with a puff of fine ash .  Go through all these houses . Giant, get to the top of this tree, have a look . I ’ ll have the hounds brought up too . Perchance this time the trail will be fresher.  His tone did not suggest that he held out much hope of the last.
Two men went through each house, to make certain nothing was missed . Jon was paired with dour Eddison Tollett, a squire grey of hair and thin as a pike, whom the other brothers called Dolorous Edd .  Bad enough when the dead come walking,  he said to Jon as they crossed the village,  now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will come of that, I ’ ll warrant . And who ’ s to say the bones wouldn ’ t lie? Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely dull fellows, full of tedious complaints—the ground ’ s too cold, my gravestone should be larger, why does he get more worms than I do . . .
Jon had to stoop to pass through the low door . Within he found a packed dirt floor . There were no furnishings, no sign that people had lived here but for some ashes beneath the smoke hole in the roof . [BOS] What a dismal place to live, [EOS] he said.
I was born in a house much like this,  declared Dolorous Edd .  Those were my enchanted years . Later I fell on hard times.  A nest of dry straw bedding filled one corner of the room . Edd looked at it with longing .  I ’ d give all the gold in Casterly Rock to sleep in a bed again.
You call that a bed?
If it ’ s softer than the ground and has a roof over it, I call it a bed.  Dolorous Edd sniffed the air .  I smell dung.
The smell was very faint .  Old dung,  said Jon . The house felt as though it had been empty for some time . Kneeling, he searched through the straw with his hands to see if anything had been concealed beneath, then made a round of the walls . It did not take very long .  There ’ s nothing here.
Nothing was what he had expected; Whitetree was the fourth village they had passed, and it had been the same in all of them . The people were gone, vanished with their scant possessions and whatever animals they may have had . None of the villages showed any signs of having been attacked . They were simply . . . empty . Jon asked . [BOS] What do you think happened to them all? [EOS]
Something worse than we can imagine,  suggested Dolorous Edd .  Well, I might be able to imagine it, but I ’ d sooner not . Bad enough to know you ’ re going to come to some awful end without thinking about it aforetime.
Two of the hounds were sniffing around the door as they reemerged . Other dogs ranged through the village . Chett was cursing them loudly, his voice thick with the anger he never seemed to put aside . The light filtering through the red leaves of the weirwood made the boils on his face look even more inflamed than usual . When he saw Jon his eyes narrowed; there was no love lost between them.
The other houses had yielded no wisdom .  Gone,  cried Mormont ’ s raven, flapping up into the weirwood to perch above them .  Gone, gone, gone.
There were wildlings at Whitetree only a year ago.  Thoren Smallwood looked more a lord than Mormont did, clad in Ser Jaremy Rykker ’ s gleaming black mail and embossed breastplate . His heavy cloak was richly trimmed with sable, and clasped with the crossed hammers of the Rykkers, wrought in silver . Ser Jaremy ’ s cloak, once . . . but the wight had claimed Ser Jaremy, and the Night ’ s Watch wasted nothing.
A year ago Robert was king, and the realm was at peace,  declared Jarman Buckwell, the square stolid man who commanded the scouts .  Much can change in a year ’ s time.
One thing hasn ’ t changed,  Ser Mallador Locke insisted .  Fewer wildlings means fewer worries . I won ’ t mourn, whatever ’ s become of them . Raiders and murderers, the lot of them.
Jon heard a rustling from the red leaves above . Two branches parted, and he glimpsed a little man moving from limb to limb as easily as a squirrel . Bedwyck stood no more than five feet tall, but the grey streaks in his hair showed his age . The other rangers called him Giant . He sat in a fork of the tree over their heads and said, [BOS] There ’ s water to the north . A lake, might be . A few flint hills rising to the west, not very high . Nothing else to see, my lords . [EOS]
We might camp here tonight,  Smallwood suggested.
The Old Bear glanced up, searching for a glimpse of sky through the pale limbs and red leaves of the weirwood .  No,  he declared .  Giant, how much daylight remains to us?
Three hours, my lord.
We ’ ll press on north,  Mormont decided .  If we reach this lake, we can make camp by the shore, perchance catch a few fish . Jon, fetch me paper, it ’ s past time I wrote Maester Aemon.
Jon found parchment, quill, and ink in his saddlebag and brought them to the Lord Commander . At Whitetree, Mormont scrawled . The fourth village . All empty . The wildlings are gone .  Find Tarly and see that he gets this on its way,  he said as he handed Jon the message . When he whistled, his raven came flapping down to land on his horse ’ s head .  Corn,  the raven suggested, bobbing . The horse whickered.
Jon mounted his garron, wheeled him about, and trotted off . Beyond the shade of the great weirwood the men of the Night ’ s Watch stood beneath lesser trees, tending their horses, chewing strips of salt beef, pissing, scratching, and talking . When the command was given to move out again, the talk died, and they climbed back into their saddles . Jarman Buckwell ’ s scouts rode out first, with the vanguard under Thoren Smallwood heading the column proper . Then came the Old Bear with the main force, Ser Mallador Locke with the baggage train and packhorses, and finally Ser Ottyn Wythers and the rear guard . Two hundred men all told, with half again as many mounts.
By day they followed game trails and streambeds, the  ranger ’ s roads  that led them ever deeper into the wilderness of leaf and root . At night they camped beneath a starry sky and gazed up at the comet . The black brothers had left Castle Black in good spirits, joking and trading tales, but of late the brooding silence of the wood seemed to have sombered them all . Jests had grown fewer and tempers shorter . No one would admit to being afraid—they were men of the Night ’ s Watch, after all—but Jon could feel the unease . Four empty villages, no wildlings anywhere, even the game seemingly fled . The haunted forest had never seemed more haunted, even veteran rangers agreed.
As he rode, Jon peeled off his glove to air his burned fingers . Ugly things . He remembered suddenly how he used to muss Arya ’ s hair . His little stick of a sister . He wondered how she was faring . It made him a little sad to think that he might never muss her hair again . He began to flex his hand, opening and closing the fingers . If he let his sword hand stiffen and grow clumsy, it well might be the end of him, he knew . A man needed his sword beyond the Wall.
Jon found Samwell Tarly with the other stewards, watering his horses . He had three to tend: his own mount, and two packhorses, each bearing a large wire-and-wicker cage full of ravens . The birds flapped their wings at Jon ’ s approach and screamed at him through the bars . A few shrieks sounded suspiciously like words . [BOS] Have you been teaching them to talk? [EOS] he asked Sam.
A few words . Three of them can say snow.
One bird croaking my name was bad enough,  said Jon,  and snow ’ s nothing a black brother wants to hear about.  Snow often meant death in the north.
Was there anything in Whitetree?
Jon handed Sam the roll of parchment . [BOS] Bones, ashes, and empty houses. The Old Bear wants word sent back to Aemon . [EOS]
Sam took a bird from one of the cages, stroked its feathers, attached the message, and said,  Fly home now, brave one . Home.  The raven quorked something unintelligible back at him, and Sam tossed it into the air . Flapping, it beat its way skyward through the trees .  I wish he could carry me with him.
Well,  said Sam,  yes, but . . . I ’ m not as frightened as I was, truly . The first night, every time I heard someone getting up to make water, I thought it was wildlings creeping in to slit my throat . I was afraid that if I closed my eyes, I might never open them again, only . . . well . . . dawn came after all.  He managed a wan smile .  I may be craven, but I ’ m not stupid . I ’ m sore and my back aches from riding and from sleeping on the ground, but I ’ m hardly scared at all . Look.  He held out a hand for Jon to see how steady it was .  I ’ ve been working on my maps.
The world is strange, Jon thought . Two hundred brave men had left the Wall, and the only one who was not growing more fearful was Sam, the self-confessed coward .  We ’ ll make a ranger of you yet,  he joked .  Next thing, you ’ ll want to be an outrider like Grenn . Shall I speak to the Old Bear?
Don ’ t you dare!  Sam pulled up the hood of his enormous black cloak and clambered awkwardly back onto his horse . It was a plow horse, big and slow and clumsy, but better able to bear his weight than the little garrons the rangers rode .  I had hoped we might stay the night in the village,  he said wistfully .  It would be nice to sleep under a roof again.
Jon mounted again, gave Sam a parting smile, and rode off . The column was well under way, so he swung wide around the village to avoid the worst of the congestion . He had seen enough of Whitetree . [BOS] Too few roofs for all of us. [EOS]
Ghost emerged from the undergrowth so suddenly that the garron shied and reared . The white wolf hunted well away from the line of march, but he was not having much better fortune than the foragers Smallwood sent out after game . The woods were as empty as the villages, Dywen had told him one night around the fire .  We ’ re a large party,  Jon had said .  The game ’ s probably been frightened away by all the noise we make on the march.
Frightened away by something, no doubt,  Dywen said.
Once the horse had settled, Ghost loped along easily beside him . Jon caught up to Mormont as he was wending his way around a hawthorn thicket .  Is the bird away?  the Old Bear asked.
Yes, my lord . Sam is teaching them to talk.
The Old Bear snorted .  He ’ ll regret that . Damned things make a lot of noise, but they never say a thing worth hearing.
They rode in silence, until Jon said,  If my uncle found all these villages empty as well—
—he would have made it his purpose to learn why,  Lord Mormont finished for him,  and it may well be someone or something did not want that known . Well, we ’ ll be three hundred when Qhorin joins us . Whatever enemy waits out here will not find us so easy to deal with . We will find them, Jon, I promise you.
Or they will find us, thought Jon.
A blowing rain lashed at Jon ’ s face as he spurred his horse across the swollen stream . Beside him, Lord Commander Mormont gave the hood of his cloak a tug, muttering curses on the weather . His raven sat on his shoulder, feathers ruffled, as soaked and grumpy as the Old Bear himself . A gust of wind sent wet leaves flapping round them like a flock of dead birds . The haunted forest, Jon thought ruefully . The drowned forest, more like it.
He hoped Sam was holding up, back down the column . He was not a good rider even in fair weather, and six days of rain had made the ground treacherous, all soft mud and hidden rocks . When the wind blew, it drove the water right into their eyes . The Wall would be flowing off to the south, the melting ice mingling with warm rain to wash down in sheets and rivers . Pyp and Toad would be sitting near the fire in the common room, drinking cups of mulled wine before their supper . Jon envied them . His wet wool clung to him sodden and itching, his neck and shoulders ached fiercely from the weight of mail and sword, and he was sick of salt cod, salt beef, and hard cheese.
Up ahead a hunting horn sounded a quavering note, half drowned beneath the constant patter of the rain .  Buckwell ’ s horn,  the Old Bear announced .  The gods are good; Craster ’ s still there.  His raven gave a single flap of his big wings, croaked  Corn,  and ruffled his feathers up again.
Jon had often heard the black brothers tell tales of Craster and his keep . Now he would see it with his own eyes . After seven empty villages, they had all come to dread finding Craster ’ s as dead and desolate as the rest, but it seemed they would be spared that . Perhaps the Old Bear will finally get some answers, he thought . Anyway, we ’ ll be out of the rain.
Thoren Smallwood swore that Craster was a friend to the Watch, despite his unsavory reputation .  The man ’ s half-mad, I won ’ t deny it,  he ’ d told the Old Bear,  but you ’ d be the same if you ’ d spent your life in this cursed wood . Even so, he ’ s never turned a ranger away from his fire, nor does he love Mance Rayder . He ’ ll give us good counsel.
So long as he gives us a hot meal and a chance to dry our clothes, I ’ ll be happy . Dywen said Craster was a kinslayer, liar, raper, and craven, and hinted that he trafficked with slavers and demons .  And worse,  the old forester would add, clacking his wooden teeth .  There ’ s a cold smell to that one, there is.
Jon,  Lord Mormont commanded,  ride back along the column and spread the word . And remind the officers that I want no trouble about Craster ’ s wives . The men are to mind their hands and speak to these women as little as need be.
Jon turned his horse back the way they ’ d come . It was pleasant to have the rain out of his face, if only for a little while . Everyone he passed seemed to be weeping . The march was strung out through half a mile of woods . [BOS] Aye, my lord. [EOS]
In the midst of the baggage train, Jon passed Samwell Tarly, slumped in his saddle under a wide floppy hat . He was riding one dray horse and leading the others . The drumming of the rain against the hoods of their cages had the ravens squawking and fluttering . Jon called out . [BOS] You put a fox in with them? [EOS]
Water ran off the brim of Sam ’ s hat as he lifted his head .  Oh, hullo, Jon . No, they just hate the rain, the same as us.
How are you faring, Sam?
Wetly.  The fat boy managed a smile .  Nothing has killed me yet, though.
Good . Craster ’ s Keep is just ahead . If the gods are good, he ’ ll let us sleep by his fire.
Sam looked dubious .  Dolorous Edd says Craster ’ s a terrible savage . He marries his daughters and obeys no laws but those he makes himself . And Dywen told Grenn he ’ s got black blood in his veins . His mother was a wildling woman who lay with a ranger, so he ’ s a bas . . .  Suddenly he realized what he was about to say.
A bastard,  Jon said with a laugh .  You can say it, Sam . I ’ ve heard the word before.  He put the spurs to his surefooted little garron .  I need to hunt down Ser Ottyn . Be careful around Craster ’ s women.  As if Samwell Tarly needed warning on that score .  We ’ ll talk later, after we ’ ve made camp.
Jon carried the word back to Ser Ottyn Wythers, plodding along with the rear guard . A small prune-faced man of an age with Mormont, Ser Ottyn always looked tired, even at Castle Black, and the rain had beaten him down unmercifully .  Welcome tidings,  he said .  This wet has soaked my bones, and even my saddle sores complain of saddle sores.
On his way back, Jon swung wide of the column ’ s line of march and took a shorter path through the thick of the wood . The sounds of man and horse diminished, swallowed up by the wet green wild, and soon enough he could hear only the steady wash of rain against leaf and tree and rock . It was midafternoon, yet the forest seemed as dark as dusk . Jon wove a path between rocks and puddles, past great oaks, grey-green sentinels, and black-barked ironwoods . In places the branches wove a canopy overhead and he was given a moment ’ s respite from the drumming of the rain against his head . As he rode past a lightning-blasted chestnut tree overgrown with wild white roses, he heard something rustling in the underbrush .  Ghost,  he called out .  Ghost, to me.
But it was Dywen who emerged from the greenery, forking a shaggy grey garron with Grenn ahorse beside him . The Old Bear had deployed outriders to either side of the main column, to screen their march and warn of the approach of any enemies, and even there he took no chances, sending the men out in pairs.
Ah, it ’ s you, Lord Snow.  Dywen smiled an oaken smile; his teeth were carved of wood, and fit badly .  Thought me and the boy had us one o ’ them Others to deal with . Lose your wolf?
He ’ s off hunting.  Ghost did not like to travel with the column, but he would not be far . When they made camp for the night, he ’ d find his way to Jon at the Lord Commander ’ s tent.
Fishing, I ’ d call it, in this wet,  Dywen said.
My mother always said rain was good for growing crops,  Grenn put in hopefully.
Aye, a good crop of mildew,  Dywen said .  The best thing about a rain like this, it saves a man from taking baths.  He made a clacking sound on his wooden teeth.
Jon told them . [BOS] Buckwell ’ s found Craster, [EOS]
Had he lost him?  Dywen chuckled .  See that you young bucks don ’ t go nosing about Craster ’ s wives, you hear?
Jon smiled . [BOS] Want them all for yourself, Dywen? [EOS]
Dywen clacked his teeth some more .  Might be I do . Craster ’ s got ten fingers and one cock, so he don ’ t count but to eleven . He ’ d never miss a couple.
How many wives does he have, truly?  Grenn asked.
More ’ n you ever will, brother . Well, it ’ s not so hard when you breed your own . There ’ s your beast, Snow.
Ghost was trotting along beside Jon ’ s horse with tail held high, his white fur ruffed up thick against the rain . He moved so silently Jon could not have said just when he appeared . Grenn ’ s mount shied at the scent of him; even now, after more than a year, the horses were uneasy in the presence of the direwolf . Jon spurred off to Craster ’ s Keep . [BOS] With me, Ghost. [EOS]
He had never thought to find a stone castle on the far side of the Wall, but he had pictured some sort of motte-and-bailey with a wooden palisade and a timber tower keep . What they found instead was a midden heap, a pigsty, an empty sheepfold, and a windowless daub-and-wattle hall scarce worthy of the name . It was long and low, chinked together from logs and roofed with sod . The compound stood atop a rise too modest to name a hill, surrounded by an earthen dike . Brown rivulets flowed down the slope where the rain had eaten gaping holes in the defenses, to join a rushing brook that curved around to the north, its thick waters turned into a murky torrent by the rains.
On the southwest, he found an open gate flanked by a pair of animal skulls on high poles: a bear to one side, a ram to the other . Bits of flesh still clung to the bear skull, Jon noted as he joined the line riding past . Within, Jarmen Buckwell ’ s scouts and men from Thoren Smallwood ’ s van were setting up horse lines and struggling to raise tents . A host of piglets rooted about three huge sows in the sty . Nearby, a small girl pulled carrots from a garden, naked in the rain, while two women tied a pig for slaughter . The animal ’ s squeals were high and horrible, almost human in their distress . Chett ’ s hounds barked wildly in answer, snarling and snapping despite his curses, with a pair of Craster ’ s dogs barking back . When they saw Ghost, some of the dogs broke off and ran, while others began to bay and growl . The direwolf ignored them, as did Jon.
Well, thirty of us will be warm and dry, Jon thought once he ’ d gotten a good look at the hall . Perhaps as many as fifty . The place was much too small to sleep two hundred men, so most would need to remain outside . And where to put them? The rain had turned half the compound yard to ankle-deep puddles and the rest to sucking mud . Another dismal night was in prospect.
The Lord Commander had entrusted his mount to Dolorous Edd . He was cleaning mud out of the horse ’ s hooves as Jon dismounted .  Lord Mormont ’ s in the hall,  he announced .  He said for you to join him . Best leave the wolf outside, he looks hungry enough to eat one of Craster ’ s children . Well, truth be told, I ’ m hungry enough to eat one of Craster ’ s children, so long as he was served hot . Go on, I ’ ll see to your horse . If it ’ s warm and dry inside, don ’ t tell me, I wasn ’ t asked in.  He flicked a glob of wet mud out from under a horseshoe .  Does this mud look like shit to you? Could it be that this whole hill is made of Craster ’ s shit?
Jon smiled . [BOS] Well, I hear he ’ s been here a long time . [EOS]
You cheer me not . Go see the Old Bear.
Ghost, stay,  he commanded . The door to Craster ’ s Keep was made of two flaps of deerhide . Jon shoved between them, stooping to pass under the low lintel . Two dozen of the chief rangers had preceded him, and were standing around the firepit in the center of the dirt floor while puddles collected about their boots . The hall stank of soot, dung, and wet dog . The air was heavy with smoke, yet somehow still damp . Rain leaked through the smoke hole in the roof . It was all a single room, with a sleeping loft above reached by a pair of splintery ladders.
Jon remembered how he ’ d felt the day they had left the Wall: nervous as a maiden, but eager to glimpse the mysteries and wonders beyond each new horizon . Well, here ’ s one of the wonders, he told himself, gazing about the squalid, foul-smelling hall . The acrid smoke was making his eyes water . A pity that Pyp and Toad can ’ t see all they ’ re missing.
Craster sat above the fire, the only man to enjoy his own chair . Even Lord Commander Mormont must seat himself on the common bench, with his raven muttering on his shoulder . Jarman Buckwell stood behind, dripping from patched mail and shiny wet leather, beside Thoren Smallwood in the late Ser Jaremy ’ s heavy breastplate and sable-trimmed cloak.
Craster ’ s sheepskin jerkin and cloak of sewn skins made a shabby contrast, but around one thick wrist was a heavy ring that had the glint of gold . He looked to be a powerful man, though well into the winter of his days now, his mane of hair grey going to white . A flat nose and a drooping mouth gave him a cruel look, and one of his ears was missing . So this is a wildling . Jon remembered Old Nan ’ s tales of the savage folk who drank blood from human skulls . Craster seemed to be drinking a thin yellow beer from a chipped stone cup . Perhaps he had not heard the stories.
I ’ ve not seen Benjen Stark for three years,  he was telling Mormont .  And if truth be told, I never once missed him.  A half-dozen black puppies and the odd pig or two skulked among the benches, while women in ragged deerskins passed horns of beer, stirred the fire, and chopped carrots and onions into a kettle.
He ought to have passed here last year,  said Thoren Smallwood . A dog came sniffing round his leg . He kicked it and sent it off yipping.
Lord Mormont said,  Ben was searching for Ser Waymar Royce, who ’ d vanished with Gared and young Will.
Aye, those three I recall . The lordling no older than one of these pups . Too proud to sleep under my roof, him in his sable cloak and black steel . My wives give him big cow eyes all the same.  He turned his squint on the nearest of the women .  Gared says they were chasing raiders . I told him, with a commander that green, best not catch ’ em . Gared wasn ’ t half-bad, for a crow . Had less ears than me, that one . The ’ bite took ’ em, same as mine.  Craster laughed .  Now I hear he got no head neither . The ’ bite do that too?
Jon remembered a spray of red blood on white snow, and the way Theon Greyjoy had kicked the dead man ’ s head . The man was a deserter . On the way back to Winterfell, Jon and Robb had raced, and found six direwolf pups in the snow . A thousand years ago.
When Ser Waymar left you, where was he bound?
Craster gave a shrug .  Happens I have better things to do than tend to the comings and goings of crows.  He drank a pull of beer and set the cup aside .  Had no good southron wine up here for a bear ’ s night . I could use me some wine, and a new axe . Mine ’ s lost its bite, can ’ t have that, I got me women to protect.  He gazed around at his scurrying wives.
You are few here, and isolated,  Mormont said .  If you like, I ’ ll detail some men to escort you south to the Wall.
The raven seemed to like the notion .  Wall,  it screamed, spreading black wings like a high collar behind Mormont ’ s head.
Their host gave a nasty smile, showing a mouthful of broken brown teeth .  And what would we do there, serve you at supper? We ’ re free folk here . Craster serves no man.
These are bad times to dwell alone in the wild . The cold winds are rising.
Let them rise . My roots are sunk deep.  Craster grabbed a passing woman by the wrist .  Tell him, wife . Tell the Lord Crow how well content we are.
The woman licked at thin lips .  This is our place . Craster keeps us safe . Better to die free than live a slave.
Slave,  muttered the raven.
Mormont leaned forward .  Every village we have passed has been abandoned . Yours are the first living faces we ’ ve seen since we left the Wall . The people are gone . . . whether dead, fled, or taken, I could not say . The animals as well . Nothing is left . And earlier, we found the bodies of two of Ben Stark ’ s rangers only a few leagues from the Wall . They were pale and cold, with black hands and black feet and wounds that did not bleed . Yet when we took them back to Castle Black they rose in the night and killed . One slew Ser Jaremy Rykker and the other came for me, which tells me that they remember some of what they knew when they lived, but there was no human mercy left in them.
The woman ’ s mouth hung open, a wet pink cave, but Craster only gave a snort .  We ’ ve had no such troubles here . . . and I ’ ll thank you not to tell such evil tales under my roof . I ’ m a godly man, and the gods keep me safe . If wights come walking, I ’ ll know how to send them back to their graves . Though I could use me a sharp new axe.  He sent his wife scurrying with a slap on her leg and a shout of  More beer, and be quick about it.
No trouble from the dead,  Jarmen Buckwell said,  but what of the living, my lord? What of your king?
King!  cried Mormont ’ s raven .  King, king, king.
That Mance Rayder?  Craster spit into the fire .  King-beyond-the-Wall . What do free folk want with kings?  He turned his squint on Mormont .  There ’ s much I could tell you o ’ Rayder and his doings, if I had a mind . This o ’ the empty villages, that ’ s his work . You would have found this hall abandoned as well, if I were a man to scrape to such . He sends a rider, tells me I must leave my own keep to come grovel at his feet . I sent the man back, but kept his tongue . It ’ s nailed to that wall there.  He pointed .  Might be that I could tell you where to seek Mance Rayder . If I had a mind.  The brown smile again .  But we ’ ll have time enough for that . You ’ ll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, belike, and eat me out of pigs.
A roof would be most welcome, my lord,  Mormont said .  We ’ ve had hard riding, and too much wet.
Then you ’ ll guest here for a night . No longer, I ’ m not that fond o ’ crows . The loft ’ s for me and mine, but you ’ ll have all the floor you like . I ’ ve meat and beer for twenty, no more . The rest o ’ your black crows can peck after their own corn.
We ’ ve packed in our own supplies, my lord,  said the Old Bear .  We should be pleased to share our food and wine.
Craster wiped his drooping mouth with the back of a hairy hand .  I ’ ll taste your wine, Lord Crow, that I will . One more thing . Any man lays a hand on my wives, he loses the hand.
Your roof, your rule,  said Thoren Smallwood, and Lord Mormont nodded stiffly, though he looked none too pleased.
That ’ s settled, then.  Craster grudged them a grunt .  D ’ ya have a man can draw a map?
Jon pushed forward . [BOS] Sam Tarly can. Sam loves maps . [EOS]
Mormont beckoned him closer .  Send him here after he ’ s eaten . Have him bring quill and parchment . And find Tollett as well . Tell him to bring my axe . A guest gift for our host.
Who ’ s this one now?  Craster said before Jon could go .  He has the look of a Stark.
My steward and squire, Jon Snow.
A bastard, is it?  Craster looked Jon up and down .  Man wants to bed a woman, seems like he ought to take her to wife . That ’ s what I do.  He shooed Jon off with a wave .  Well, run and do your service, bastard, and see that axe is good and sharp now, I ’ ve no use for dull steel.
Jon Snow bowed stiffly and took his leave . Ser Ottyn Wythers was coming in as he was leaving, and they almost collided at the deerhide door . Outside, the rain seemed to have slackened . Tents had gone up all over the compound . Jon could see the tops of others under the trees.
Dolorous Edd was feeding the horses .  Give the wildling an axe, why not?  He pointed out Mormont ’ s weapon, a short-hafted battle-axe with gold scrollwork inlaid on the black steel blade .  He ’ ll give it back, I vow . Buried in the Old Bear ’ s skull, like as not . Why not give him all our axes, and our swords as well? I mislike the way they clank and rattle as we ride . We ’ d travel faster without them, straight to hell ’ s door . Does it rain in hell, I wonder? Perhaps Craster would like a nice hat instead.
Jon smiled . [BOS] He wants an axe . And wine as well . [EOS]
See, the Old Bear ’ s clever . If we get the wildling well and truly drunk, perhaps he ’ ll only cut off an ear when he tries to slay us with that axe . I have two ears but only one head.
Smallwood says Craster is a friend to the Watch.
Do you know the difference between a wildling who ’ s a friend to the Watch and one who ’ s not?  asked the dour squire .  Our enemies leave our bodies for the crows and the wolves . Our friends bury us in secret graves . I wonder how long that bear ’ s been nailed up on that gate, and what Craster had there before we came hallooing?  Edd looked at the axe doubtfully, the rain running down his long face .  Is it dry in there?
Drier than out here.
If I lurk about after, not too close to the fire, belike they ’ ll take no note of me till morn . The ones under his roof will be the first he murders, but at least we ’ ll die dry.
Jon had to laugh . [BOS] Craster ’ s one man . We ’ re two hundred . I doubt he ’ ll murder anyone . [EOS]
You cheer me,  said Edd, sounding utterly morose .  And besides, there ’ s much to be said for a good sharp axe . I ’ d hate to be murdered with a maul . I saw a man hit in the brow with a maul once . Scarce split the skin at all, but his head turned mushy and swelled up big as a gourd, only purply-red . A comely man, but he died ugly . It ’ s good that we ’ re not giving them mauls.  Edd walked away shaking his head, his sodden black cloak shedding rain behind him.
Jon got the horses fed before he stopped to think of his own supper . He was wondering where to find Sam when he heard a shout of fear .  Wolf!  He sprinted around the hall toward the cry, the earth sucking at his boots . One of Craster ’ s women was backed up against the mud-spattered wall of the keep .  Keep away,  she was shouting at Ghost .  You keep away!  The direwolf had a rabbit in his mouth and another dead and bloody on the ground before him .  Get it away, m ’ lord,  she pleaded when she saw him.
He won ’ t hurt you.  He knew at once what had happened; a wooden hutch, its slats shattered, lay on its side in the wet grass .  He must have been hungry . We haven ’ t seen much game.  Jon whistled . The direwolf bolted down the rabbit, crunching the small bones between his teeth, and padded over to him.
The woman regarded them with nervous eyes . She was younger than he ’ d thought at first . A girl of fifteen or sixteen years, he judged, dark hair plastered across a gaunt face by the falling rain, her bare feet muddy to the ankles . The body under the sewn skins was showing in the early turns of pregnancy .  Are you one of Craster ’ s daughters?  he asked.
She put a hand over her belly .  Wife now.  Edging away from the wolf, she knelt mournfully beside the broken hutch .  I was going to breed them rabbits . There ’ s no sheep left.
The Watch will make good for them.  Jon had no coin of his own, or he would have offered it to her . . . though he was not sure what good a few coppers or even a silver piece would do her beyond the Wall .  I ’ ll speak to Lord Mormont on the morrow.
She wiped her hands on her skirt .  M ’ lord—
I ’ m no lord.
But others had come crowding round, drawn by the woman ’ s scream and the crash of the rabbit hutch .  Don ’ t you believe him, girl,  called out Lark the Sisterman, a ranger mean as a cur .  That ’ s Lord Snow himself.
Bastard of Winterfell and brother to kings,  mocked Chett, who ’ d left his hounds to see what the commotion was about.
That wolf ’ s looking at you hungry, girl,  Lark said .  Might be it fancies that tender bit in your belly.
Jon was not amused . [BOS] You ’ re scaring her . [EOS]
Warning her, more like.  Chett ’ s grin was as ugly as the boils that covered most of his face.
We ’ re not to talk to you,  the girl remembered suddenly.
Jon said, too late . She bolted, ran . [BOS] Wait, [EOS]
Lark made a grab for the second rabbit, but Ghost was quicker . When he bared his teeth, the Sisterman slipped in the mud and went down on his bony butt . The others laughed . The direwolf took the rabbit in his mouth and brought it to Jon.
There was no call to scare the girl,  he told them.
We ’ ll hear no scolds from you, bastard.  Chett blamed Jon for the loss of his comfortable position with Maester Aemon, and not without justice . If he had not gone to Aemon about Sam Tarly, Chett would still be tending an old blind man instead of a pack of ill-tempered hunting hounds .  You may be the Lord Commander ’ s pet, but you ’ re not the Lord Commander . . . and you wouldn ’ t talk so bloody bold without that monster of yours always about.
Jon answered, his voice cooler than he felt . [BOS] I ’ ll not fight a brother while we ’ re beyond the Wall, [EOS]
Lark got to one knee .  He ’ s afraid of you, Chett . On the Sisters, we have a name for them like him.
I know all the names . Save your breath.  He walked away, Ghost at his side . The rain had dwindled to a thin drizzle by the time he reached the gate . Dusk would be on them soon, followed by another wet dark dismal night . The clouds would hide moon and stars and Mormont ’ s Torch, turning the woods black as pitch . Every piss would be an adventure, if not quite of the sort Jon Snow had once envisioned.
Out under the trees, some rangers had found enough duff and dry wood to start a fire beneath a slanting ridge of slate . Others had raised tents or made rude shelters by stretching their cloaks over low branches . Giant had crammed himself inside the hollow of a dead oak .  How d ’ ye like my castle, Lord Snow?
It looks snug . You know where Sam is?
Keep on the way you were . If you come on Ser Ottyn ’ s pavilion, you ’ ve gone too far.  Giant smiled .  Unless Sam ’ s found him a tree too . What a tree that would be.
It was Ghost who found Sam in the end . The direwolf shot ahead like a quarrel from a crossbow . Under an outcrop of rock that gave some small degree of shelter from the rain, Sam was feeding the ravens . His boots squished when he moved .  My feet are soaked through,  he admitted miserably .  When I climbed off my horse, I stepped in a hole and went in up to my knees.
Jon showed Sam the rabbit . [BOS] Take off your boots and dry your stockings . I ’ ll find some dry wood . If the ground ’ s not wet under the rock, we might be able to get a fire burning. And we ’ ll feast . [EOS]
Won ’ t you be attending Lord Mormont in the hall?
No, but you will . The Old Bear wants you to map for him . Craster says he ’ ll find Mance Rayder for us.
Oh.  Sam did not look anxious to meet Craster, even if it meant a warm fire.
He said eat first, though . Dry your feet.  Jon went to gather fuel, digging down under deadfalls for the drier wood beneath and peeling back layers of sodden pine needles until he found likely kindling . Even then, it seemed to take forever for a spark to catch . He hung his cloak from the rock to keep the rain off his smoky little fire, making them a small snug alcove.
As he knelt to skin the rabbit, Sam pulled off his boots .  I think there ’ s moss growing between my toes,  he declared mournfully, wriggling the toes in question .  The rabbit will taste good . I don ’ t even mind about the blood and all.  He looked away .  Well, only a little . . .
Jon spitted the carcass, banked the fire with a pair of rocks, and balanced their meal atop them . The rabbit had been a scrawny thing, but as it cooked it smelled like a king ’ s feast . Other rangers gave them envious looks . Even Ghost looked up hungrily, flames shining in his red eyes as he sniffed . [BOS] You had yours before, [EOS] Jon reminded him.
Is Craster as savage as the rangers say?  Sam asked . The rabbit was a shade underdone, but tasted wonderful .  What ’ s his castle like?
Jon told Sam what he had seen and heard in Craster ’ s Keep . [BOS] A midden heap with a roof and a firepit. [EOS]
By the time the telling was done, it was dark outside and Sam was licking his fingers .  That was good, but now I ’ d like a leg of lamb . A whole leg, just for me, sauced with mint and honey and cloves . Did you see any lambs?
There was a sheepfold, but no sheep.
How does he feed all his men?
I didn ’ t see any men . Just Craster and his women and a few small girls . I wonder he ’ s able to hold the place . His defenses were nothing to speak of, only a muddy dike . You had better go up to the hall and draw that map . Can you find the way?
If I don ’ t fall in the mud.  Sam struggled back into his boots, collected quill and parchment, and shouldered out into the night, the rain pattering down on his cloak and floppy hat.
Ghost laid his head on his paws and went to sleep by the fire . Jon stretched out beside him, grateful for the warmth . He was cold and wet, but not so cold and wet as he ’ d been a short time before . Perhaps tonight the Old Bear will learn something that will lead us to Uncle Benjen.
He woke to the sight of his own breath misting in the cold morning air . When he moved, his bones ached . Ghost was gone, the fire burnt out . Jon reached to pull aside the cloak he ’ d hung over the rock, and found it stiff and frozen . He crept beneath it and stood up in a forest turned to crystal.
The pale pink light of dawn sparkled on branch and leaf and stone . Every blade of grass was carved from emerald, every drip of water turned to diamond . Flowers and mushrooms alike wore coats of glass . Even the mud puddles had a bright brown sheen . Through the shimmering greenery, the black tents of his brothers were encased in a fine glaze of ice.
So there is magic beyond the Wall after all . He found himself thinking of his sisters, perhaps because he ’ d dreamed of them last night . Sansa would call this an enchantment, and tears would fill her eyes at the wonder of it, but Arya would run out laughing and shouting, wanting to touch it all.
Lord Snow?  he heard . Soft and meek . He turned.
Crouched atop the rock that had sheltered him during the night was the rabbit keeper, wrapped in a black cloak so large it drowned her . Sam ’ s cloak, Jon realized at once . Why is she wearing Sam ’ s cloak?  The fat one told me I ’ d find you here, m ’ lord,  she said.
We ate the rabbit, if that ’ s what you came for.  The admission made him feel absurdly guilty.
Old Lord Crow, him with the talking bird, he gave Craster a crossbow worth a hundred rabbits.  Her arms closed over the swell of her belly .  Is it true, m ’ lord? Are you brother to a king?
A half brother,  he admitted .  I ’ m Ned Stark ’ s bastard . My brother Robb is the King in the North . Why are you here?
The fat one, that Sam, he said to see you . He give me his cloak, so no one would say I didn ’ t belong.
Won ’ t Craster be angry with you?
My father drank overmuch of the Lord Crow ’ s wine last night . He ’ ll sleep most of the day.  Her breath frosted the air in small nervous puffs .  They say the king gives justice and protects the weak.  She started to climb off the rock, awkwardly, but the ice had made it slippery and her foot went out from under her . Jon caught her before she could fall, and helped her safely down . The woman knelt on the icy ground .  M ’ lord, I beg you—
Don ’ t beg me anything . Go back to your hall, you shouldn ’ t be here . We were commanded not to speak to Craster ’ s women.
You don ’ t have to speak with me, m ’ lord . Just take me with you, when you go, that ’ s all I ask.
All she asks, he thought . As if that were nothing.
I ’ ll . . . I ’ ll be your wife, if you like . My father, he ’ s got nineteen now, one less won ’ t hurt him none.
Black brothers are sworn never to take wives, don ’ t you know that? And we ’ re guests in your father ’ s hall besides.
Not you,  she said .  I watched . You never ate at his board, nor slept by his fire . He never gave you guest-right, so you ’ re not bound to him . It ’ s for the baby I have to go.
I don ’ t even know your name.
Gilly, he called me . For the gillyflower.
That ’ s pretty.  He remembered Sansa telling him once that he should say that whenever a lady told him her name . He could not help the girl, but perhaps the courtesy would please her .  Is it Craster who frightens you, Gilly?
For the baby, not for me . If it ’ s a girl, that ’ s not so bad, she ’ ll grow a few years and he ’ ll marry her . But Nella says it ’ s to be a boy, and she ’ s had six and knows these things . He gives the boys to the gods . Come the white cold, he does, and of late it comes more often . That ’ s why he started giving them sheep, even though he has a taste for mutton . Only now the sheep ’ s gone too . Next it will be dogs, till . . .  She lowered her eyes and stroked her belly.
What gods?  Jon was remembering that they ’ d seen no boys in Craster ’ s Keep, nor men either, save Craster himself.
The cold gods,  she said .  The ones in the night . The white shadows.
And suddenly Jon was back in the Lord Commander ’ s Tower again . A severed hand was climbing his calf and when he pried it off with the point of his longsword, it lay writhing, fingers opening and closing . The dead man rose to his feet, blue eyes shining in that gashed and swollen face . Ropes of torn flesh hung from the great wound in his belly, yet there was no blood.
What color are their eyes?  he asked her.
Blue . As bright as blue stars, and as cold.
She has seen them, he thought . Craster lied.
Will you take me? Just so far as the Wall—
We do not ride for the Wall . We ride north, after Mance Rayder and these Others, these white shadows and their wights . We seek them, Gilly . Your babe would not be safe with us.
Her fear was plain on her face .  You will come back, though . When your warring ’ s done, you ’ ll pass this way again.
We may.  If any of us still live .  That ’ s for the Old Bear to say, the one you call the Lord Crow . I ’ m only his squire . I do not choose the road I ride.
No.  He could hear the defeat in her voice .  Sorry to be of trouble, m ’ lord . I only . . . they said the king keeps people safe, and I thought . . .  Despairing, she ran, Sam ’ s cloak flapping behind her like great black wings.
Jon watched her go, his joy in the morning ’ s brittle beauty gone . Damn her, he thought resentfully, and damn Sam twice for sending her to me . What did he think I could do for her? We ’ re here to fight wildlings, not save them.
Other men were crawling from their shelters, yawning and stretching . The magic was already faded, icy brightness turning back to common dew in the light of the rising sun . Someone had gotten a fire started; he could smell woodsmoke drifting through the trees, and the smoky scent of bacon . Jon took down his cloak and snapped it against the rock, shattering the thin crust of ice that had formed in the night, then gathered up Longclaw and shrugged an arm through a shoulder strap . A few yards away he made water into a frozen bush, his piss steaming in the cold air and melting the ice wherever it fell . Afterward he laced up his black wool breeches and followed the smells.
Grenn and Dywen were among the brothers who had gathered round the fire . Hake handed Jon a hollow heel of bread filled with burnt bacon and chunks of salt fish warmed in bacon grease . He wolfed it down while listening to Dywen boast of having three of Craster ’ s women during the night.
You did not,  Grenn said, scowling .  I would have seen.
Dywen whapped him up alongside his ear with the back of his hand .  You? Seen? You ’ re blind as Maester Aemon . You never even saw that bear.
What bear? Was there a bear?
There ’ s always a bear,  declared Dolorous Edd in his usual tone of gloomy resignation .  One killed my brother when I was young . Afterward it wore his teeth around its neck on a leather thong . And they were good teeth too, better than mine . I ’ ve had nothing but trouble with my teeth.
Jon asked him . [BOS] Did Sam sleep in the hall last night? [EOS]
I ’ d not call it sleeping . The ground was hard, the rushes ill-smelling, and my brothers snore frightfully . Speak of bears if you will, none ever growled so fierce as Brown Bernarr . I was warm, though . Some dogs crawled atop me during the night . My cloak was almost dry when one of them pissed in it . Or perhaps it was Brown Bernarr . Have you noticed that the rain stopped the instant I had a roof above me? It will start again now that I ’ m back out . Gods and dogs alike delight to piss on me.
I ’ d best go see to Lord Mormont,  said Jon.
The rain might have stopped, but the compound was still a morass of shallow lakes and slippery mud . Black brothers were folding their tents, feeding their horses, and chewing on strips of salt beef . Jarman Buckwell ’ s scouts were tightening the girths on their saddles before setting out .  Jon,  Buckwell greeted him from horseback .  Keep a good edge on that bastard sword of yours . We ’ ll be needing it soon enough.
Craster ’ s hall was dim after daylight . Inside, the night ’ s torches had burned low, and it was hard to know that the sun had risen . Lord Mormont ’ s raven was the first to spy him enter . Three lazy flaps of its great black wings, and it perched atop Longclaw ’ s hilt .  Corn?  It nipped at a strand of Jon ’ s hair.
Ignore that wretched beggar bird, Jon, it ’ s just had half my bacon.  The Old Bear sat at Craster ’ s board, breaking his fast with the other officers on fried bread, bacon, and sheepgut sausage . Craster ’ s new axe was on the table, its gold inlay gleaming faintly in the torchlight . Its owner was sprawled unconscious in the sleeping loft above, but the women were all up, moving about and serving .  What sort of day do we have?
Cold, but the rain has stopped.
Very good . See that my horse is saddled and ready . I mean for us to ride within the hour . Have you eaten? Craster serves plain fare, but filling.
I will not eat Craster ’ s food, he decided suddenly . Jon shooed the raven off Longclaw . The bird hopped back to Mormont ’ s shoulder, where it promptly shat . [BOS] I broke my fast with the men, my lord. You might have done that on Snow instead of saving it for me, [EOS] the Old Bear grumbled . The raven quorked.
He found Sam behind the hall, standing with Gilly at the broken rabbit hutch . She was helping him back into his cloak, but when she saw Jon she stole away . Sam gave him a look of wounded reproach .  I thought you would help her.
Jon said sharply . [BOS] And how was I to do that? Take her with us, wrapped up in your cloak? We were commanded not to— [EOS]
I know,  said Sam guiltily,  but she was afraid . I know what it is to be afraid . I told her . . .  He swallowed.
What? That we ’ d take her with us?
Sam ’ s fat face blushed a deep red .  On the way home.  He could not meet Jon ’ s eyes .  She ’ s going to have a baby.
Sam, have you taken leave of all your sense? We may not even return this way . And if we do, do you think the Old Bear is going to let you pack off one of Craster ’ s wives?
I thought . . . maybe by then I could think of a way . . .
Jon walked away as confused as he was angry . Sam ’ s heart was as big as the rest of him, but for all his reading he could be as thick as Grenn at times . It was impossible, and dishonorable besides . So why do I feel so ashamed? [BOS] I have no time for this, I have horses to groom and saddle. [EOS]
Jon took his accustomed position at Mormont ’ s side as the Night ’ s Watch streamed out past the skulls on Craster ’ s gate . They struck off north and west along a crooked game trail . Melting ice dripped down all about them, a slower sort of rain with its own soft music . North of the compound, the brook was in full spate, choked with leaves and bits of wood, but the scouts had found where the ford lay and the column was able to splash across . The water ran as high as a horse ’ s belly . Ghost swam, emerging on the bank with his white fur dripping brown . When he shook, spraying mud and water in all directions, Mormont said nothing, but on his shoulder the raven screeched.
Jon said quietly as the wood closed in around them once more . [BOS] My lord, Craster has no sheep . Nor any sons . [EOS]
Mormont made no answer.
At Winterfell one of the serving women told us stories,  Jon went on .  She used to say that there were wildlings who would lay with the Others to birth half-human children.
Hearth tales . Does Craster seem less than human to you?
In half a hundred ways .  He gives his sons to the wood.
A long silence . Then:  Yes.  And  Yes,  the raven muttered, strutting .  Yes, yes, yes.
You knew?
Smallwood told me . Long ago . All the rangers know, though few will talk of it.
Did my uncle know?
All the rangers,  Mormont repeated .  You think I ought to stop him . Kill him if need be.  The Old Bear sighed .  Were it only that he wished to rid himself of some mouths, I ’ d gladly send Yoren or Conwys to collect the boys . We could raise them to the black and the Watch would be that much the stronger . But the wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I . These boys are Craster ’ s offerings . His prayers, if you will.
His wives must offer different prayers, Jon thought.
How is it you came to know this?  the Old Bear asked him .  From one of Craster ’ s wives?
Jon confessed . [BOS] Yes, my lord, I would sooner not tell you which . She was frightened and wanted help . [EOS]
The wide world is full of people wanting help, Jon . Would that some could find the courage to help themselves . Craster sprawls in his loft even now, stinking of wine and lost to sense . On his board below lies a sharp new axe . Were it me, I ’ d name it  Answered Prayer ’ and make an end.
Yes . Jon thought of Gilly . She and her sisters . They were nineteen, and Craster was one, but . . .
Yet it would be an ill day for us if Craster died . Your uncle could tell you of the times Craster ’ s Keep made the difference between life and death for our rangers.
My father . . .  He hesitated.
Go on, Jon . Say what you would say.
Jon finished . [BOS] My father once told me that some men are not worth having, A bannerman who is brutal or unjust dishonors his liege lord as well as himself . [EOS]
Craster is his own man . He has sworn us no vows . Nor is he subject to our laws . Your heart is noble, Jon, but learn a lesson here . We cannot set the world to rights . That is not our purpose . The Night ’ s Watch has other wars to fight.
Other wars . Yes . I must remember .  Jarman Buckwell said I might have need of my sword soon.
Did he?  Mormont did not seem pleased .  Craster said much and more last night, and confirmed enough of my fears to condemn me to a sleepless night on his floor . Mance Rayder is gathering his people together in the Frostfangs . That ’ s why the villages are empty . It is the same tale that Ser Denys Mallister had from the wildling his men captured in the Gorge, but Craster has added the where, and that makes all the difference.
Is he making a city, or an army?
Now, that is the question . How many wildlings are there? How many men of fighting age? No one knows with certainty . The Frostfangs are cruel, inhospitable, a wilderness of stone and ice . They will not long sustain any great number of people . I can see only one purpose in this gathering . Mance Rayder means to strike south, into the Seven Kingdoms.
Wildlings have invaded the realm before.  Jon had heard the tales from Old Nan and Maester Luwin both, back at Winterfell .  Raymun Redbeard led them south in the time of my grandfather ’ s grandfather, and before him there was a king named Bael the Bard.
Aye, and long before them came the Horned Lord and the brother kings Gendel and Gorne, and in ancient days Joramun, who blew the Horn of Winter and woke giants from the earth . Each man of them broke his strength on the Wall, or was broken by the power of Winterfell on the far side . . . but the Night ’ s Watch is only a shadow of what we were, and who remains to oppose the wildlings besides us? The Lord of Winterfell is dead, and his heir has marched his strength south to fight the Lannisters . The wildlings may never again have such a chance as this . I knew Mance Rayder, Jon . He is an oathbreaker, yes . . . but he has eyes to see, and no man has ever dared to name him faintheart.
What will we do?  asked Jon.
Find him,  said Mormont .  Fight him . Stop him.
Three hundred, thought Jon, against the fury of the wild . His fingers opened and closed.
The hill jutted above the dense tangle of forest, rising solitary and sudden, its windswept heights visible from miles off . The wildlings called it the Fist of the First Men, rangers said . It did look like a fist, Jon Snow thought, punching up through earth and wood, its bare brown slopes knuckled with stone.
He rode to the top with Lord Mormont and the officers, leaving Ghost below under the trees . The direwolf had run off three times as they climbed, twice returning reluctantly to Jon ’ s whistle . The third time, the Lord Commander lost patience and snapped,  Let him go, boy . I want to reach the crest before dusk . Find the wolf later.
The way up was steep and stony, the summit crowned by a chest-high wall of tumbled rocks . They had to circle some distance west before they found a gap large enough to admit the horses .  This is good ground, Thoren,  the Old Bear proclaimed when at last they attained the top .  We could scarce hope for better . We ’ ll make our camp here to await Halfhand.  The Lord Commander swung down off his saddle, dislodging the raven from his shoulder . Complaining loudly, the bird took to the air.
The views atop the hill were bracing, yet it was the ringwall that drew Jon ’ s eye, the weathered grey stones with their white patches of lichen, their beards of green moss . It was said that the Fist had been a ringfort of the First Men in the Dawn Age .  An old place, and strong,  Thoren Smallwood said.
Old,  Mormont ’ s raven screamed as it flapped in noisy circles about their heads .  Old, old, old.
Quiet,  Mormont growled up at the bird . The Old Bear was too proud to admit to weakness, but Jon was not deceived . The strain of keeping up with younger men was taking its toll.
These heights will be easy to defend, if need be,  Thoren pointed out as he walked his horse along the ring of stones, his sable-trimmed cloak stirring in the wind.
Yes, this place will do.  The Old Bear lifted a hand to the wind, and raven landed on his forearm, claws scrabbling against his black ringmail.
Jon wondered . [BOS] What about water, my lord? [EOS]
We crossed a brook at the foot of the hill.
Jon pointed out, [BOS] A long climb for a drink, and outside the ring of stones . [EOS]
Thoren said,  Are you too lazy to climb a hill, boy?
When Lord Mormont said,  We ’ re not like to find another place as strong . We ’ ll carry water, and make certain we are well supplied,  Jon knew better than to argue . So the command was given, and the brothers of the Night ’ s Watch raised their camp behind the stone ring the First Men had made . Black tents sprouted like mushrooms after a rain, and blankets and bedrolls covered the bare ground . Stewards tethered the garrons in long lines, and saw them fed and watered . Foresters took their axes to the trees in the waning afternoon light to harvest enough wood to see them through the night . A score of builders set to clearing brush, digging latrines, and untying their bundles of fire-hardened stakes .  I will have every opening in the ringwall ditched and staked before dark,  the Old Bear had commanded.
Once he ’ d put up the Lord Commander ’ s tent and seen to their horses, Jon Snow descended the hill in search of Ghost . The direwolf came at once, all in silence . One moment Jon was striding beneath the trees, whistling and shouting, alone in the green, pinecones and fallen leaves under his feet; the next, the great white direwolf was walking beside him, pale as morning mist.
But when they reached the ringfort, Ghost balked again . He padded forward warily to sniff at the gap in the stones, and then retreated, as if he did not like what he ’ d smelled . Jon tried to grab him by the scruff of his neck and haul him bodily inside the ring, no easy task; the wolf weighed as much as he did, and was stronger by far .  Ghost, what ’ s wrong with you?  It was not like him to be so unsettled . In the end Jon had to give it up .  As you will,  he told the wolf .  Go, hunt.  The red eyes watched him as he made his way back through the mossy stones.
They ought to be safe here . The hill offered commanding views, and the slopes were precipitous to the north and west and only slightly more gentle to the east . Yet as the dusk deepened and darkness seeped into the hollows between the trees, Jon ’ s sense of foreboding grew . This is the haunted forest, he told himself . Maybe there are ghosts here, the spirits of the First Men . This was their place, once.
Stop acting the boy,  he told himself . Clambering atop the piled rocks, Jon gazed off toward the setting sun . He could see the light shimmering like hammered gold off the surface of the Milkwater as it curved away to the south . Upriver the land was more rugged, the dense forest giving way to a series of bare stony hills that rose high and wild to the north and west . On the horizon stood the mountains like a great shadow, range on range of them receding into the blue-grey distance, their jagged peaks sheathed eternally in snow . Even from afar they looked vast and cold and inhospitable.
Closer at hand, it was the trees that ruled . To south and east the wood went on as far as Jon could see, a vast tangle of root and limb painted in a thousand shades of green, with here and there a patch of red where a weirwood shouldered through the pines and sentinels, or a blush of yellow where some broadleafs had begun to turn . When the wind blew, he could hear the creak and groan of branches older than he was . A thousand leaves fluttered, and for a moment the forest seemed a deep green sea, storm-tossed and heaving, eternal and unknowable.
Ghost was not like to be alone down there, he thought . Anything could be moving under that sea, creeping toward the ringfort through the dark of the wood, concealed beneath those trees . Anything . How would they ever know? He stood there for a long time, until the sun vanished behind the saw-toothed mountains and darkness began to creep through the forest.
Jon?  Samwell Tarly called up .  I thought it looked like you . Are you well?
Jon hopped down . [BOS] Well enough. How did you fare today? [EOS]
Well . I fared well . Truly.
Jon was not about to share his disquiet with his friend, not when Samwell Tarly was at last beginning to find his courage . [BOS] The Old Bear means to wait here for Qhorin Halfhand and the men from the Shadow Tower . [EOS]
It seems a strong place,  said Sam .  A ringfort of the First Men . Do you think there were battles fought here?
No doubt . You ’ d best get a bird ready . Mormont will want to send back word.
I wish I could send them all . They hate being caged.
You would too, if you could fly.
If I could fly, I ’ d be back at Castle Black eating a pork pie,  said Sam.
Jon clapped him on the shoulder with his burned hand . They walked back through the camp together . Cookfires were being lit all around them . Overhead, the stars were coming out . The long red tail of Mormont ’ s Torch burned as bright as the moon . Jon heard the ravens before he saw them . Some were calling his name . The birds were not shy when it came to making noise.
They feel it too .  I ’ d best see to the Old Bear,  he said .  He gets noisy when he isn ’ t fed as well.
He found Mormont talking with Thoren Smallwood and half a dozen other officers .  There you are,  the old man said gruffly .  Bring us some hot wine, if you would . The night is chilly.
Yes, my lord.  Jon built a cookfire, claimed a small cask of Mormont ’ s favorite robust red from stores, and poured it into a kettle . He hung the kettle above the flames while he gathered the rest of his ingredients . The Old Bear was particular about his hot spiced wine . So much cinnamon and so much nutmeg and so much honey, not a drop more . Raisins and nuts and dried berries, but no lemon, that was the rankest sort of southron heresy—which was queer, since he always took lemon in his morning beer . The drink must be hot to warm a man properly, the Lord Commander insisted, but the wine must never be allowed to come to a boil . Jon kept a careful eye on the kettle.
As he worked, he could hear the voices from inside the tent . Jarman Buckwell said,  The easiest road up into the Frostfangs is to follow the Milkwater back to its source . Yet if we go that path, Rayder will know of our approach, certain as sunrise.
The Giant ’ s Stair might serve,  said Ser Mallador Locke,  or the Skirling Pass, if it ’ s clear.
The wine was steaming . Jon lifted the kettle off the fire, filled eight cups, and carried them into the tent . The Old Bear was peering at the crude map Sam had drawn him that night back in Craster ’ s Keep . He took a cup from Jon ’ s tray, tried a swallow of wine, and gave a brusque nod of approval . His raven hopped down his arm .  Corn,  it said .  Corn . Corn.
Ser Ottyn Wythers waved the wine away .  I would not go into the mountains at all,  he said in a thin, tired voice .  The Frostfangs have a cruel bite even in summer, and now . . . if we should be caught by a storm . . .
I do not mean to risk the Frostfangs unless I must,  said Mormont .  Wildlings can no more live on snow and stone than we can . They will emerge from the heights soon, and for a host of any size, the only route is along the Milkwater . If so, we are strongly placed here . They cannot hope to slip by us.
They may not wish to . They are thousands, and we will be three hundred when the Halfhand reaches us.  Ser Mallador accepted a cup from Jon.
If it comes to battle, we could not hope for better ground than here,  declared Mormont .  We ’ ll strengthen the defenses . Pits and spikes, caltrops scattered on the slopes, every breach mended . Jarman, I ’ ll want your sharpest eyes as watchers . A ring of them, all around us and along the river, to warn of any approach . Hide them up in trees . And we had best start bringing up water too, more than we need . We ’ ll dig cisterns . It will keep the men occupied, and may prove needful later.
My rangers—  started Thoren Smallwood.
Your rangers will limit their ranging to this side of the river until the Halfhand reaches us . After that, we ’ ll see . I will not lose more of my men.
Mance Rayder might be massing his host a day ’ s ride from here, and we ’ d never know,  Smallwood complained.
We know where the wildlings are massing,  Mormont came back .  We had it from Craster . I mislike the man, but I do not think he lied to us in this.
As you say.  Smallwood took a sullen leave . The others finished their wine and followed, more courteously.
Jon asked . [BOS] Shall I bring you supper, my lord? [EOS]
Corn,  the raven cried . Mormont did not answer at once . When he did he said only,  Did your wolf find game today?
He ’ s not back yet.
We could do with fresh meat.  Mormont dug into a sack and offered his raven a handful of corn .  You think I ’ m wrong to keep the rangers close?
That ’ s not for me to say, my lord.
It is if you ’ re asked.
Jon admitted . [BOS] If the rangers must stay in sight of the Fist, I don ’ t see how they can hope to find my uncle, [EOS]
They can ’ t.  The raven pecked at the kernels in the Old Bear ’ s palm .  Two hundred men or ten thousand, the country is too vast.  The corn gone, Mormont turned his hand over.
You would not give up the search?
Maester Aemon thinks you clever.  Mormont moved the raven to his shoulder . The bird tilted its head to one side, little eyes a-glitter.
The answer was there .  Is it . . . it seems to me that it might be easier for one man to find two hundred than for two hundred to find one.
The raven gave a cackling scream, but the Old Bear smiled through the grey of his beard .  This many men and horses leave a trail even Aemon could follow . On this hill, our fires ought to be visible as far off as the foothills of the Frostfangs . If Ben Stark is alive and free, he will come to us, I have no doubt.
Yes,  said Jon,  but . . . what if . . .
. . . he ’ s dead?  Mormont asked, not unkindly.
Jon nodded, reluctantly.
Dead,  the raven said .  Dead . Dead.
He may come to us anyway,  the Old Bear said .  As Othor did, and Jafer Flowers . I dread that as much as you, Jon, but we must admit the possibility.
Dead,  his raven cawed, ruffling its wings . Its voice grew louder and more shrill .  Dead.
Mormont stroked the bird ’ s black feathers, and stifled a sudden yawn with the back of his hand .  I will forsake supper, I believe . Rest will serve me better . Wake me at first light.
Jon gathered up the empty cups and stepped outside . He heard distant laughter, the plaintive sound of pipes . A great blaze was crackling in the center of the camp, and he could smell stew cooking . The Old Bear might not be hungry, but Jon was . He drifted over toward the fire . [BOS] Sleep well, my lord. [EOS]
Dywen was holding forth, spoon in hand .  I know this wood as well as any man alive, and I tell you, I wouldn ’ t care to ride through it alone tonight . Can ’ t you smell it?
Grenn was staring at him with wide eyes, but Dolorous Edd said,  All I smell is the shit of two hundred horses . And this stew . Which has a similar aroma, now that I come to sniff it.
I ’ ve got your similar aroma right here.  Hake patted his dirk . Grumbling, he filled Jon ’ s bowl from the kettle.
The stew was thick with barley, carrot, and onion, with here and there a ragged shred of salt beef, softened in the cooking.
What is it you smell, Dywen?  asked Grenn.
The forester sucked on his spoon a moment . He had taken out his teeth . His face was leathery and wrinkled, his hands gnarled as old roots .  Seems to me like it smells . . . well . . . cold.
Your head ’ s as wooden as your teeth,  Hake told him .  There ’ s no smell to cold.
There is, thought Jon, remembering the night in the Lord Commander ’ s chambers . It smells like death . Suddenly he was not hungry anymore . He gave his stew to Grenn, who looked in need of an extra supper to warm him against the night.
The wind was blowing briskly when he left . By morning, frost would cover the ground, and the tent ropes would be stiff and frozen . A few fingers of spiced wine sloshed in the bottom of the kettle . Jon fed fresh wood to the fire and put the kettle over the flames to reheat . He flexed his fingers as he waited, squeezing and spreading until the hand tingled . The first watch had taken up their stations around the perimeter of the camp . Torches flickered all along the ringwall . The night was moonless, but a thousand stars shone overhead.
A sound rose out of the darkness, faint and distant, but unmistakable: the howling of wolves . Their voices rose and fell, a chilly song, and lonely . It made the hairs rise along the back of his neck . Across the fire, a pair of red eyes regarded him from the shadows . The light of the flames made them glow.
Ghost,  Jon breathed, surprised .  So you came inside after all, eh?  The white wolf often hunted all night; he had not expected to see him again till daybreak .  Was the hunting so bad?  he asked .  Here . To me, Ghost.
The direwolf circled the fire, sniffing Jon, sniffing the wind, never still . It did not seem as if he were after meat right now . When the dead came walking, Ghost knew . He woke me, warned me . Alarmed, he got to his feet .  Is something out there? Ghost, do you have a scent?  Dywen said he smelled cold.
The direwolf loped off, stopped, looked back . He wants me to follow . Pulling up the hood of his cloak, Jon walked away from the tents, away from the warmth of his fire, past the lines of shaggy little garrons . One of the horses whickered nervously when Ghost padded by . Jon soothed him with a word and paused to stroke his muzzle . He could hear the wind whistling through cracks in the rocks as they neared the ringwall . A voice called out a challenge . Jon stepped into the torchlight .  I need to fetch water for the Lord Commander.
Go on, then,  the guard said .  Be quick about it.  Huddled beneath his black cloak, with his hood drawn up against the wind, the man never even looked to see if he had a bucket.
Jon slipped sideways between two sharpened stakes while Ghost slid beneath them . A torch had been thrust down into a crevice, its flames flying pale orange banners when the gusts came . He snatched it up as he squeezed through the gap between the stones . Ghost went racing down the hill . Jon followed more slowly, the torch thrust out before him as he made his descent . The camp sounds faded behind him . The night was black, the slope steep, stony, and uneven . A moment ’ s inattention would be a sure way to break an ankle . . . or his neck . What am I doing? he asked himself as he picked his way down.
The trees stood beneath him, warriors armored in bark and leaf, deployed in their silent ranks awaiting the command to storm the hill . Black, they seemed . . . it was only when his torchlight brushed against them that Jon glimpsed a flash of green . Faintly, he heard the sound of water flowing over rocks . Ghost vanished in the underbrush . Jon struggled after him, listening to the call of the brook, to the leaves sighing in the wind . Branches clutched at his cloak, while overhead thick limbs twined together and shut out the stars.
He found Ghost lapping from the stream .  Ghost,  he called,  to me . Now.  When the direwolf raised his head, his eyes glowed red and baleful, and water streamed down from his jaws like slaver . There was something fierce and terrible about him in that instant . And then he was off, bounding past Jon, racing through the trees .  Ghost, no, stay,  he shouted, but the wolf paid no heed . The lean white shape was swallowed by the dark, and Jon had only two choices—to climb the hill again, alone, or to follow.
He followed, angry, holding the torch out low so he could see the rocks that threatened to trip him with every step, the thick roots that seemed to grab at his feet, the holes where a man could twist an ankle . Every few feet he called again for Ghost, but the night wind was swirling amongst the trees and it drank the words . This is madness, he thought as he plunged deeper into the trees . He was about to turn back when he glimpsed a flash of white off ahead and to the right, back toward the hill . He jogged after it, cursing under his breath.
A quarter way around the Fist he chased the wolf before he lost him again . Finally he stopped to catch his breath amidst the scrub, thorns, and tumbled rocks at the base of the hill . Beyond the torchlight, the dark pressed close.
A soft scrabbling noise made him turn . Jon moved toward the sound, stepping carefully among boulders and thornbushes . Behind a fallen tree, he came on Ghost again . The direwolf was digging furiously, kicking up dirt.
Jon lowered the torch, revealing a rounded mound of soft earth . A grave, he thought . But whose? [BOS] What have you found? [EOS]
He knelt, jammed the torch into the ground beside him . The soil was loose, sandy . Jon pulled it out by the fistful . There were no stones, no roots . Whatever was here had been put here recently . Two feet down, his fingers touched cloth . He had been expecting a corpse, fearing a corpse, but this was something else . He pushed against the fabric and felt small, hard shapes beneath, unyielding . There was no smell, no sign of graveworms . Ghost backed off and sat on his haunches, watching.
Jon brushed the loose soil away to reveal a rounded bundle perhaps two feet across . He jammed his fingers down around the edges and worked it loose . When he pulled it free, whatever was inside shifted and clinked . Treasure, he thought, but the shapes were wrong to be coins, and the sound was wrong for metal.
A length of frayed rope bound the bundle together . Jon unsheathed his dagger and cut it, groped for the edges of the cloth, and pulled . The bundle turned, and its contents spilled out onto the ground, glittering dark and bright . He saw a dozen knives, leaf-shaped spearheads, numerous arrowheads . Jon picked up a dagger blade, featherlight and shiny black, hiltless . Torchlight ran along its edge, a thin orange line that spoke of razor sharpness . Dragonglass . What the maesters call obsidian . Had Ghost uncovered some ancient cache of the children of the forest, buried here for thousands of years? The Fist of the First Men was an old place, only . . .
Beneath the dragonglass was an old warhorn, made from an auroch ’ s horn and banded in bronze . Jon shook the dirt from inside it, and a stream of arrowheads fell out . He let them fall, and pulled up a corner of the cloth the weapons had been wrapped in, rubbing it between his fingers . Good wool, thick, a double weave, damp but not rotted . It could not have been long in the ground . And it was dark . He seized a handful and pulled it close to the torch . Not dark . Black.
Even before Jon stood and shook it out, he knew what he had: the black cloak of a Sworn Brother of the Night ’ s Watch.
The call came drifting through the black of night . Jon pushed himself onto an elbow, his hand reaching for Longclaw by force of habit as the camp began to stir . The horn that wakes the sleepers, he thought.
The long low note lingered at the edge of hearing . The sentries at the ringwall stood still in their footsteps, breath frosting and heads turned toward the west . As the sound of the horn faded, even the wind ceased to blow . Men rolled from their blankets and reached for spears and swordbelts, moving quietly, listening . A horse whickered and was hushed . For a heartbeat it seemed as if the whole forest were holding its breath . The brothers of the Night ’ s Watch waited for a second blast, praying they should not hear it, fearing that they would.
When the silence had stretched unbearably long and the men knew at last that the horn would not wind again, they grinned at one another sheepishly, as if to deny that they had been anxious . Jon Snow fed a few sticks to the fire, buckled on his swordbelt, pulled on his boots, shook the dirt and dew from the cloak, and fastened it around his shoulders . The flames blazed up beside him, welcome heat beating against his face as he dressed . He could hear the Lord Commander moving inside the tent . After a moment Mormont lifted the flap .  One blast?  On his shoulder, his raven sat fluffed and silent, looking miserable.
Jon agreed . [BOS] One, my lord, Brothers returning . [EOS]
Mormont moved to the fire .  The Halfhand . And past time.  He had grown more restive every day they waited; much longer and he would have been fit to whelp cubs .  See that there ’ s hot food for the men and fodder for the horses . I ’ ll see Qhorin at once.
I ’ ll bring him, my lord.  The men from the Shadow Tower had been expected days ago . When they had not appeared, the brothers had begun to wonder . Jon had heard gloomy mutterings around the cookfire, and not just from Dolorous Edd . Ser Ottyn Wythers was for retreating to Castle Black as soon as possible . Ser Mallador Locke would strike for the Shadow Tower, hoping to pick up Qhorin ’ s trail and learn what had befallen him . And Thoren Smallwood wanted to push on into the mountains .  Mance Rayder knows he must battle the Watch,  Thoren had declared,  but he will never look for us so far north . If we ride up the Milkwater, we can take him unawares and cut his host to ribbons before he knows we are on him.
The numbers would be greatly against us,  Ser Ottyn had objected .  Craster said he was gathering a great host . Many thousands . Without Qhorin, we are only two hundred.
Send two hundred wolves against ten thousand sheep, ser, and see what happens,  said Smallwood confidently.
There are goats among these sheep, Thoren,  warned Jarman Buckwell .  Aye, and maybe a few lions . Rattleshirt, Harma the Dogshead, Alfyn Crowkiller . . .
I know them as well as you do, Buckwell,  Thoren Smallwood snapped back .  And I mean to have their heads, every one . These are wildlings . No soldiers . A few hundred heroes, drunk most like, amidst a great horde of women, children, and thralls . We will sweep over them and send them howling back to their hovels.
They had argued for many hours, and reached no agreement . The Old Bear was too stubborn to retreat, but neither would he rush headlong up the Milkwater, seeking battle . In the end, nothing had been decided but to wait a few more days for the men from the Shadow Tower, and talk again if they did not appear.
And now they had, which meant that the decision could be delayed no longer . Jon was glad of that much, at least . If they must battle Mance Rayder, let it be soon.
He found Dolorous Edd at the fire, complaining about how difficult it was for him to sleep when people insisted on blowing horns in the woods . Jon gave him something new to complain about . Together they woke Hake, who received the Lord Commander ’ s orders with a stream of curses, but got up all the same and soon had a dozen brothers cutting roots for a soup.
Sam came puffing up as Jon crossed the camp . Under the black hood his face was as pale and round as the moon .  I heard the horn . Has your uncle come back?
It ’ s only the men from the Shadow Tower.  It was growing harder to cling to the hope of Benjen Stark ’ s safe return . The cloak he had found beneath the Fist could well have belonged to his uncle or one of his men, even the Old Bear admitted as much, though why they would have buried it there, wrapped around the cache of dragonglass, no one could say .  Sam, I have to go.
At the ringwall, he found the guards sliding spikes from the half-frozen earth to make an opening . It was not long until the first of the brothers from the Shadow Tower began wending their way up the slope . All in leather and fur they were, with here and there a bit of steel or bronze; heavy beards covered hard lean faces, and made them look as shaggy as their garrons . Jon was surprised to see some of them were riding two to a horse . When he looked more closely, it was plain that many of them were wounded . There has been trouble on the way.
Jon knew Qhorin Halfhand the instant he saw him, though they had never met . The big ranger was half a legend in the Watch; a man of slow words and swift action, tall and straight as a spear, long-limbed and solemn . Unlike his men, he was clean-shaven . His hair fell from beneath his helm in a heavy braid touched with hoarfrost, and the blacks he wore were so faded they might have been greys . Only thumb and forefinger remained on the hand that held the reins; the other fingers had been sheared off catching a wildling ’ s axe that would otherwise have split his skull . It was told that he had thrust his maimed fist into the face of the axeman so the blood spurted into his eyes, and slew him while he was blind . Since that day, the wildlings beyond the Wall had known no foe more implacable.
Jon hailed him . [BOS] Lord Commander Mormont would see you at once . I ’ ll show you to his tent . [EOS]
Qhorin swung down from his saddle .  My men are hungry, and our horses require tending.
They ’ ll all be seen to.
The ranger gave his horse into the care of one of his men and followed .  You are Jon Snow . You have your father ’ s look.
Did you know him, my lord?
I am no lordling . Only a brother of the Night ’ s Watch . I knew Lord Eddard, yes . And his father before him.
Jon had to hurry his steps to keep up with Qhorin ’ s long strides . [BOS] Lord Rickard died before I was born . [EOS]
He was a friend to the Watch.  Qhorin glanced behind .  It is said that a direwolf runs with you.
Ghost should be back by dawn . He hunts at night.
They found Dolorous Edd frying a rasher of bacon and boiling a dozen eggs in a kettle over the Old Bear ’ s cookfire . Mormont sat in his wood-and-leather camp chair .  I had begun to fear for you . Did you meet with trouble?
We met with Alfyn Crowkiller . Mance had sent him to scout along the Wall, and we chanced on him returning.  Qhorin removed his helm .  Alfyn will trouble the realm no longer, but some of his company escaped us . We hunted down as many as we could, but it may be that a few will win back to the mountains.
And the cost?
Four brothers dead . A dozen wounded . A third as many as the foe . And we took captives . One died quickly from his wounds, but the other lived long enough to be questioned.
Best talk of this inside . Jon will fetch you a horn of ale . Or would you prefer hot spiced wine?
Boiled water will suffice . An egg and a bite of bacon.
As you wish.  Mormont lifted the flap of the tent and Qhorin Halfhand stooped and stepped through.
Edd stood over the kettle swishing the eggs about with a spoon .  I envy those eggs,  he said .  I could do with a bit of boiling about now . If the kettle were larger, I might jump in . Though I would sooner it were wine than water . There are worse ways to die than warm and drunk . I knew a brother drowned himself in wine once . It was a poor vintage, though, and his corpse did not improve it.
You drank the wine?
It ’ s an awful thing to find a brother dead . You ’ d have need of a drink as well, Lord Snow.  Edd stirred the kettle and added a pinch more nutmeg.
Restless, Jon squatted by the fire and poked at it with a stick . He could hear the Old Bear ’ s voice inside the tent, punctuated by the raven ’ s squawks and Qhorin Halfhand ’ s quieter tones, but he could not make out the words . Alfyn Crowkiller dead, that ’ s good . He was one of the bloodiest of the wildling raiders, taking his name from the black brothers he ’ d slain . So why does Qhorin sound so grave, after such a victory?
Jon had hoped that the arrival of men from the Shadow Tower would lift the spirits in the camp . Only last night, he was coming back through the dark from a piss when he heard five or six men talking in low voices around the embers of a fire . When he heard Chett muttering that it was past time they turned back, Jon stopped to listen .  It ’ s an old man ’ s folly, this ranging,  he heard .  We ’ ll find nothing but our graves in them mountains.
There ’ s giants in the Frostfangs, and wargs, and worse things,  said Lark the Sisterman.
I ’ ll not be going there, I promise you.
The Old Bear ’ s not like to give you a choice.
Might be we won ’ t give him one,  said Chett.
Just then one of the dogs had raised his head and growled, and he had to move away quickly, before he was seen . I was not meant to hear that, he thought . He considered taking the tale to Mormont, but he could not bring himself to inform on his brothers, even brothers such as Chett and the Sisterman . It was just empty talk, he told himself . They are cold and afraid; we all are . It was hard waiting here, perched on the stony summit above the forest, wondering what the morrow might bring . The unseen enemy is always the most fearsome.
Jon slid his new dagger from its sheath and studied the flames as they played against the shiny black glass . He had fashioned the wooden hilt himself, and wound hempen twine around it to make a grip . Ugly, but it served . Dolorous Edd opined that glass knives were about as useful as nipples on a knight ’ s breastplate, but Jon was not so certain . The dragonglass blade was sharper than steel, albeit far more brittle.
It must have been buried for a reason.
He had made a dagger for Grenn as well, and another for the Lord Commander . The warhorn he had given to Sam . On closer examination the horn had proved cracked, and even after he had cleaned all the dirt out, Jon had been unable to get any sound from it . The rim was chipped as well, but Sam liked old things, even worthless old things . Jon told him, [BOS] Make a drinking horn out of it, and every time you take a drink you ’ ll remember how you ranged beyond the Wall, all the way to the Fist of the First Men. [EOS] He gave Sam a spearhead and a dozen arrowheads as well, and passed the rest out among his other friends for luck.
The Old Bear had seemed pleased by the dagger, but he preferred a steel knife at his belt, Jon had noticed . Mormont could offer no answers as to who might have buried the cloak or what it might mean . Perhaps Qhorin will know . The Halfhand had ventured deeper into the wild than any other living man.
You want to serve, or shall I?
Jon sheathed the dagger . [BOS] I ’ ll do it. [EOS] He wanted to hear what they were saying.
Edd cut three thick slices off a stale round of oat bread, stacked them on a wooden platter, covered them with bacon and bacon drippings, and filled a bowl with hard-cooked eggs . Jon took the bowl in one hand and the platter in the other and backed into the Lord Commander ’ s tent.
Qhorin was seated cross-legged on the floor, his spine as straight as a spear . Candlelight flickered against the hard flat planes of his cheeks as he spoke .  . . . Rattleshirt, the Weeping Man, and every other chief great and small,  he was saying .  They have wargs as well, and mammoths, and more strength than we would have dreamed . Or so he claimed . I will not swear as to the truth of it . Ebben believes the man was telling us tales to make his life last a little longer.
True or false, the Wall must be warned,  the Old Bear said as Jon placed the platter between them .  And the king.
Which king?
All of them . The true and the false alike . If they would claim the realm, let them defend it.
The Halfhand helped himself to an egg and cracked it on the edge of the bowl .  These kings will do what they will,  he said, peeling away the shell .  Likely it will be little enough . The best hope is Winterfell . The Starks must rally the north.
Yes . To be sure.  The Old Bear unrolled a map, frowned at it, tossed it aside, opened another . He was pondering where the hammer would fall, Jon could see it . The Watch had once manned seventeen castles along the hundred leagues of the Wall, but they had been abandoned one by one as the brotherhood dwindled . Only three were now garrisoned, a fact that Mance Rayder knew as well as they did .  Ser Alliser Thorne will bring back fresh levies from King ’ s Landing, we can hope . If we man Greyguard from the Shadow Tower and the Long Barrow from Eastwatch . . .
Greyguard has largely collapsed . Stonedoor would serve better, if the men could be found . Icemark and Deep Lake as well, mayhaps . With daily patrols along the battlements between.
Patrols, aye . Twice a day, if we can . The Wall itself is a formidable obstacle . Undefended, it cannot stop them, yet it will delay them . The larger the host, the longer they ’ ll require . From the emptiness they ’ ve left behind, they must mean to bring their women with them . Their young as well, and beasts . . . have you ever seen a goat climb a ladder? A rope? They will need to build a stair, or a great ramp . . . it will take a moon ’ s turn at the least, perhaps longer . Mance will know his best chance is to pass beneath the Wall . Through a gate, or . . .
A breach.
Mormont ’ s head came up sharply .  What?
They do not plan to climb the Wall nor to burrow beneath it, my lord . They plan to break it.
The Wall is seven hundred feet high, and so thick at the base that it would take a hundred men a year to cut through it with picks and axes.
Even so.
Mormont plucked at his beard, frowning .  How?
How else? Sorcery.  Qhorin bit the egg in half .  Why else would Mance choose to gather his strength in the Frostfangs? Bleak and hard they are, and a long weary march from the Wall.
I ’ d hoped he chose the mountains to hide his muster from the eyes of my rangers.
Perhaps,  said Qhorin, finishing the egg,  but there is more, I think . He is seeking something in the high cold places . He is searching for something he needs.
Something?  Mormont ’ s raven lifted its head and screamed . The sound was sharp as a knife in the closeness of the tent.
Some power . What it is, our captive could not say . He was questioned perhaps too sharply, and died with much unsaid . I doubt he knew in any case.
Jon could hear the wind outside . It made a high thin sound as it shivered through the stones of the ringwall and tugged at the tent ropes . Mormont rubbed his mouth thoughtfully .  Some power,  he repeated .  I must know.
Then you must send scouts into the mountains.
I am loath to risk more men.
We can only die . Why else do we don these black cloaks, but to die in defense of the realm? I would send fifteen men, in three parties of five . One to probe the Milkwater, one the Skirling Pass, one to climb the Giant ’ s Stair . Jarman Buckwell, Thoren Smallwood, and myself to command . To learn what waits in those mountains.
Waits,  the raven cried .  Waits.
Lord Commander Mormont sighed deep in his chest .  I see no other choice,  he conceded,  but if you do not return . . .
Someone will come down out of the Frostfangs, my lord,  the ranger said .  If us, all well and good . If not, it will be Mance Rayder, and you sit square in his path . He cannot march south and leave you behind, to follow and harry his rear . He must attack . This is a strong place.
Not that strong,  said Mormont.
Belike we shall all die, then . Our dying will buy time for our brothers on the Wall . Time to garrison the empty castles and freeze shut the gates, time to summon lords and kings to their aid, time to hone their axes and repair their catapults . Our lives will be coin well spent.
Die,  the raven muttered, pacing along Mormont ’ s shoulders .  Die, die, die, die.  The Old Bear sat slumped and silent, as if the burden of speech had grown too heavy for him to bear . But at last he said,  May the gods forgive me . Choose your men.
Qhorin Halfhand turned his head . His eyes met Jon ’ s, and held them for a long moment .  Very well . I choose Jon Snow.
Mormont blinked .  He is hardly more than a boy . And my steward besides . Not even a ranger.
Tollett can care for you as well, my lord.  Qhorin lifted his maimed, two-fingered hand .  The old gods are still strong beyond the Wall . The gods of the First Men . . . and the Starks.
Mormont looked at Jon .  What is your will in this?
To go,  he said at once.
The old man smiled sadly .  I thought it might be.
Dawn had broken when Jon stepped from the tent beside Qhorin Halfhand . The wind swirled around them, stirring their black cloaks and sending a scatter of red cinders flying from the fire.
We ride at noon,  the ranger told him .  Best find that wolf of yours.
They could see the fire in the night, glimmering against the side of the mountain like a fallen star . It burned redder than the other stars, and did not twinkle, though sometimes it flared up bright and sometimes dwindled down to no more than a distant spark, dull and faint.
Half a mile ahead and two thousand feet up, Jon judged, and perfectly placed to see anything moving in the pass below.
Watchers in the Skirling Pass,  wondered the oldest among them . In the spring of his youth, he had been squire to a king, so the black brothers still called him Squire Dalbridge .  What is it Mance Rayder fears, I wonder?
If he knew they ’ d lit a fire, he ’ d flay the poor bastards,  said Ebben, a squat bald man muscled like a bag of rocks.
Fire is life up here,  said Qhorin Halfhand,  but it can be death as well.  By his command, they ’ d risked no open flames since entering the mountains . They ate cold salt beef, hard bread, and harder cheese, and slept clothed and huddled beneath a pile of cloaks and furs, grateful for each other ’ s warmth . It made Jon remember cold nights long ago at Winterfell, when he ’ d shared a bed with his brothers . These men were brothers too, though the bed they shared was stone and earth.
They ’ ll have a horn,  said Stonesnake.
The Halfhand said,  A horn they must not blow.
That ’ s a long cruel climb by night,  Ebben said as he eyed the distant spark through a cleft in the rocks that sheltered them . The sky was cloudless, the jagged mountains rising black on black until the very top, where their cold crowns of snow and ice shone palely in the moonlight.
And a longer fall,  said Qhorin Halfhand .  Two men, I think . There are like to be two up there, sharing the watch.
Me.  The ranger they called Stonesnake had already shown that he was the best climber among them . It would have to be him.
And me,  said Jon Snow.
Qhorin Halfhand looked at him . Jon could hear the wind keening as it shivered through the high pass above them . One of the garrons whickered and pawed at the thin stony soil of the hollow where they had taken shelter .  The wolf will remain with us,  Qhorin said .  White fur is seen too easily by moonlight.  He turned to Stonesnake .  When it ’ s done, throw down a burning brand . We ’ ll come when we see it fall.
No better time to start than now,  said Stonesnake.
They each took a long coil of rope . Stonesnake carried a bag of iron spikes as well, and a small hammer with its head wrapped in thick felt . Their garrons they left behind, along with their helms, mail, and Ghost . Jon knelt and let the direwolf nuzzle him before they set off .  Stay,  he commanded .  I ’ ll be back for you.
Stonesnake took the lead . He was a short wiry man, near fifty and grey of beard but stronger than he seemed, and he had the best night eyes of anyone Jon had ever known . He needed them tonight . By day the mountains were blue-grey, brushed with frost, but once the sun vanished behind the jagged peaks they turned black . Now the rising moon had limned them in white and silver.
The black brothers moved through black shadows amidst black rocks, working their way up a steep, twisting trail as their breath frosted in the black air . Jon felt almost naked without his mail, but he did not miss its weight . This was hard going, and slow . To hurry here was to risk a broken ankle or worse . Stonesnake seemed to know where to put his feet as if by instinct, but Jon needed to be more careful on the broken, uneven ground.
The Skirling Pass was really a series of passes, a long twisting course that went up around a succession of icy wind-carved peaks and down through hidden valleys that seldom saw the sun . Apart from his companions, Jon had glimpsed no living man since they ’ d left the wood behind and begun to make their way upward . The Frostfangs were as cruel as any place the gods had made, and as inimical to men . The wind cut like a knife up here, and shrilled in the night like a mother mourning her slain children . What few trees they saw were stunted, grotesque things growing sideways out of cracks and fissures . Tumbled shelves of rock often overhung the trail, fringed with hanging icicles that looked like long white teeth from a distance.
Yet even so, Jon Snow was not sorry he had come . There were wonders here as well . He had seen sunlight flashing on icy thin waterfalls as they plunged over the lips of sheer stone cliffs, and a mountain meadow full of autumn wildflowers, blue coldsnaps and bright scarlet frostfires and stands of piper ’ s grass in russet and gold . He had peered down ravines so deep and black they seemed certain to end in some hell, and he had ridden his garron over a wind-eaten bridge of natural stone with nothing but sky to either side . Eagles nested in the heights and came down to hunt the valleys, circling effortlessly on great blue-grey wings that seemed almost part of the sky . Once he had watched a shadowcat stalk a ram, flowing down the mountainside like liquid smoke until it was ready to pounce.
Now it is our turn to pounce . He wished he could move as sure and silent as that shadowcat, and kill as quickly . Longclaw was sheathed across his back, but he might not have room to use it . He carried dirk and dagger for closer work . They will have weapons as well, and I am not armored . He wondered who would prove the shadowcat by night ’ s end, and who the ram.
For a long way they stayed to the trail, following its twists and turns as it snaked along the side of the mountain, upward, ever upward . Sometimes the mountain folded back on itself and they lost sight of the fire, but soon or late it would always reappear . The path Stonesnake chose would never have served for the horses . In places Jon had to put his back to the cold stone and shuffle along sideways like a crab, inch by inch . Even where the track widened it was treacherous; there were cracks big enough to swallow a man ’ s leg, rubble to stumble over, hollow places where the water pooled by day and froze hard by night . One step and then another, Jon told himself . One step and then another, and I will not fall.
He had not shaved since leaving the Fist of the First Men, and the hair on his lip was soon stiff with frost . Two hours into the climb, the wind kicked up so fiercely that it was all he could do to hunch down and cling to the rock, praying he would not be blown off the mountain . One step and then another, he resumed when the gale subsided . One step and then another, and I will not fall.
Soon they were high enough so that looking down was best not considered . There was nothing below but yawning blackness, nothing above but moon and stars .  The mountain is your mother,  Stonesnake had told him during an easier climb a few days past .  Cling to her, press your face up against her teats, and she won ’ t drop you.  Jon had made a joke of it, saying how he ’ d always wondered who his mother was, but never thought to find her in the Frostfangs . It did not seem nearly so amusing now . One step and then another, he thought, clinging tight.
The narrow track ended abruptly where a massive shoulder of black granite thrust out from the side of the mountain . After the bright moonlight, its shadow was so black that it felt like stepping into a cave .  Straight up here,  the ranger said in a quiet voice .  We want to get above them.  He peeled off his gloves, tucked them through his belt, tied one end of his rope around his waist, the other end around Jon .  Follow me when the rope grows taut.  The ranger did not wait for an answer but started at once, moving upward with fingers and feet, faster than Jon would have believed . The long rope unwound slowly . Jon watched him closely, making note of how he went, and where he found each handhold, and when the last loop of hemp uncoiled, he took off his own gloves and followed, much more slowly.
Stonesnake had passed the rope around the smooth spike of rock he was waiting on, but as soon as Jon reached him he shook it loose and was off again . This time there was no convenient cleft when he reached the end of their tether, so he took out his felt-headed hammer and drove a spike deep into a crack in the stone with a series of gentle taps . Soft as the sounds were, they echoed off the stone so loudly that Jon winced with every blow, certain that the wildlings must hear them too . When the spike was secure, Stonesnake secured the rope to it, and Jon started after him . Suck on the mountain ’ s teat, he reminded himself . Don ’ t look down . Keep your weight above your feet . Don ’ t look down . Look at the rock in front of you . There ’ s a good handhold, yes . Don ’ t look down . I can catch a breath on that ledge there, all I need to do is reach it . Never look down.
Once his foot slipped as he put his weight on it and his heart stopped in his chest, but the gods were good and he did not fall . He could feel the cold seeping off the rock into his fingers, but he dared not don his gloves; gloves would slip, no matter how tight they seemed, cloth and fur moving between skin and stone, and up here that could kill him . His burned hand was stiffening up on him, and soon it began to ache . Then he ripped open his thumbnail somehow, and after that he left smears of blood wherever he put his hand . He hoped he still had all his fingers by the end of the climb.
Up they went, and up, and up, black shadows creeping across the moonlit wall of rock . Anyone down on the floor of the pass could have seen them easily, but the mountain hid them from the view of the wildlings by their fire . They were close now, though . Jon could sense it . Even so, he did not think of the foes who were waiting for him, all unknowing, but of his brother at Winterfell . Bran used to love to climb . I wish I had a tenth part of his courage.
The wall was broken two-thirds of the way up by a crooked fissure of icy stone . Stonesnake reached down a hand to help him up . He had donned his gloves again, so Jon did the same . The ranger moved his head to the left, and the two of them crawled along the shelf three hundred yards or more, until they could see the dull orange glow beyond the lip of the cliff.
The wildlings had built their watchfire in a shallow depression above the narrowest part of the pass, with a sheer drop below and rock behind to shelter them from the worst of the wind . That same windbreak allowed the black brothers to crawl within a few feet of them, creeping along on their bellies until they were looking down on the men they must kill.
One was asleep, curled up tight and buried beneath a great mound of skins . Jon could see nothing of him but his hair, bright red in the firelight . The second sat close to the flames, feeding them twigs and branches and complaining of the wind in a querulous tone . The third watched the pass, though there was little to see, only a vast bowl of darkness ringed by the snowy shoulders of the mountains . It was the watcher who wore the horn.
Three . For a moment Jon was uncertain . There was only supposed to be two . One was asleep, though . And whether there was two or three or twenty, he still must do what he had come to do . Stonesnake touched his arm, pointed at the wildling with the horn . Jon nodded toward the one by the fire . It felt queer, picking a man to kill . Half the days of his life had been spent with sword and shield, training for this moment . Did Robb feel this way before his first battle? he wondered, but there was no time to ponder the question . Stonesnake moved as fast as his namesake, leaping down on the wildlings in a rain of pebbles . Jon slid Longclaw from its sheath and followed.
It all seemed to happen in a heartbeat . Afterward Jon could admire the courage of the wildling who reached first for his horn instead of his blade . He got it to his lips, but before he could sound it Stonesnake knocked the horn aside with a swipe of his shortsword . Jon ’ s man leapt to his feet, thrusting at his face with a burning brand . He could feel the heat of the flames as he flinched back . Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the sleeper stirring, and knew he must finish his man quick . When the brand swung again, he bulled into it, swinging the bastard sword with both hands . The Valyrian steel sheared through leather, fur, wool, and flesh, but when the wildling fell he twisted, ripping the sword from Jon ’ s grasp . On the ground the sleeper sat up beneath his furs . Jon slid his dirk free, grabbing the man by the hair and jamming the point of the knife up under his chin as he reached for his—no, her—
His hand froze .  A girl.
A watcher,  said Stonesnake .  A wildling . Finish her.
Jon could see fear and fire in her eyes . Blood ran down her white throat from where the point of his dirk had pricked her . One thrust and it ’ s done, he told himself . He was so close he could smell onion on her breath . She is no older than I am . Something about her made him think of Arya, though they looked nothing at all alike . [BOS] Will you yield? [EOS] he asked, giving the dirk a half turn . And if she doesn ’ t?
I yield.  Her words steamed in the cold air.
You ’ re our captive, then.  He pulled the dirk away from the soft skin of her throat.
Qhorin said nothing of taking captives,  said Stonesnake.
He never said not to.  Jon let go his grip on the girl ’ s hair, and she scuttled backward, away from them.
She ’ s a spearwife.  Stonesnake gestured at the long-hafted axe that lay beside her sleeping furs .  She was reaching for that when you grabbed her . Give her half a chance and she ’ ll bury it between your eyes.
Jon kicked the axe well out of the girl ’ s reach . [BOS] I won ’ t give her half a chance. Do you have a name? [EOS]
Ygritte.  Her hand rubbed at her throat and came away bloody . She stared at the wetness.
Sheathing his dirk, he wrenched Longclaw free from the body of the man he ’ d killed .  You are my captive, Ygritte.
I gave you my name.
I ’ m Jon Snow.
She flinched .  An evil name.
A bastard name,  he said .  My father was Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell.
The girl watched him warily, but Stonesnake gave a mordant chuckle .  It ’ s the captive supposed to tell things, remember?  The ranger thrust a long branch into the fire .  Not that she will . I ’ ve known wildlings to bite off their own tongues before they ’ d answer a question.  When the end of the branch was blazing merrily, he took two steps and flung it out over the pass . It fell through the night spinning until it was lost to sight.
You ought to burn them you killed,  said Ygritte.
Need a bigger fire for that, and big fires burn bright.  Stonesnake turned, his eyes scanning the black distance for any spark of light .  Are there more wildlings close by, is that it?
Burn them,  the girl repeated stubbornly,  or it might be you ’ ll need them swords again.
Jon remembered dead Othor and his cold black hands . [BOS] Maybe we should do as she says . [EOS]
There are other ways.  Stonesnake knelt beside the man he ’ d slain, stripped him of cloak and boots and belt and vest, then hoisted the body over one thin shoulder and carried it to the edge . He grunted as he tossed it over . A moment later they heard a wet, heavy smack well below them . By then the ranger had the second body down to the skin and was dragging it by the arms . Jon took the feet and together they flung the dead man out in the blackness of the night.
Ygritte watched and said nothing . She was older than he ’ d thought at first, Jon realized; maybe as old as twenty, but short for her age, bandy-legged, with a round face, small hands, and a pug nose . Her shaggy mop of red hair stuck out in all directions . She looked plump as she crouched there, but most of that was layers of fur and wool and leather . Underneath all that she could be as skinny as Arya.
Jon asked her . [BOS] Were you sent to watch for us? [EOS]
You, and others.
Stonesnake warmed his hands over the fire .  What waits beyond the pass?
The free folk.
How many?
Hundreds and thousands . More than you ever saw, crow.  She smiled . Her teeth were crooked, but very white.
She doesn ’ t know how many .  Why come here?
Ygritte fell silent.
What ’ s in the Frostfangs that your king could want? You can ’ t stay here, there ’ s no food.
She turned her face away from him.
Do you mean to march on the Wall? When?
She stared at the flames as if she could not hear him.
Do you know anything of my uncle, Benjen Stark?
Ygritte ignored him . Stonesnake laughed .  If she spits out her tongue, don ’ t say I didn ’ t warn you.
A low rumbling growl echoed off the rock . Shadowcat, Jon knew at once . As he rose he heard another, closer at hand . He pulled his sword and turned, listening.
They won ’ t trouble us,  Ygritte said .  It ’ s the dead they ’ ve come for . Cats can smell blood six miles off . They ’ ll stay near the bodies till they ’ ve eaten every last stringy shred o ’ meat, and cracked the bones for the marrow.
Jon could hear the sounds of their feeding echoing off the rocks . It gave him an uneasy feeling . The warmth of the fire made him realize how bone-tired he was, but he dared not sleep . He had taken a captive, and it was on him to guard her .  Were they your kin?  he asked her quietly .  The two we killed?
No more than you are.
Me?  He frowned .  What do you mean?
You said you were the Bastard o ’ Winterfell.
I am.
Who was your mother?
Some woman . Most of them are.  Someone had said that to him once . He did not remember who.
She smiled again, a flash of white teeth .  And she never sung you the song o ’ the winter rose?
I never knew my mother . Or any such song.
Bael the Bard made it,  said Ygritte .  He was King-beyond-the-Wall a long time back . All the free folk know his songs, but might be you don ’ t sing them in the south.
Jon objected . [BOS] Winterfell ’ s not in the south, [EOS]
Yes it is . Everything below the Wall ’ s south to us.
He had never thought of it that way .  I suppose it ’ s all in where you ’ re standing.
Aye,  Ygritte agreed .  It always is.
Jon urged her . It would be hours before Qhorin came up, and a story would help keep him awake . [BOS] Tell me, I want to hear this tale of yours . [EOS]
Might be you won ’ t like it much.
I ’ ll hear it all the same.
Brave black crow,  she mocked .  Well, long before he was king over the free folk, Bael was a great raider.
Stonesnake gave a snort .  A murderer, robber, and raper, is what you mean.
That ’ s all in where you ’ re standing too,  Ygritte said .  The Stark in Winterfell wanted Bael ’ s head, but never could take him, and the taste o ’ failure galled him . One day in his bitterness he called Bael a craven who preyed only on the weak . When word o ’ that got back, Bael vowed to teach the lord a lesson . So he scaled the Wall, skipped down the kingsroad, and walked into Winterfell one winter ’ s night with harp in hand, naming himself Sygerrik of Skagos . Sygerrik means ‘ deceiver ’ in the Old Tongue, that the First Men spoke, and the giants still speak.
North or south, singers always find a ready welcome, so Bael ate at Lord Stark ’ s own table, and played for the lord in his high seat until half the night was gone . The old songs he played, and new ones he ’ d made himself, and he played and sang so well that when he was done, the lord offered to let him name his own reward . ‘ All I ask is a flower, ’ Bael answered, ‘ the fairest flower that blooms in the gardens o ’ Winterfell . ’
Now as it happened the winter roses had only then come into bloom, and no flower is so rare nor precious . So the Stark sent to his glass gardens and commanded that the most beautiful o ’ the winter roses be plucked for the singer ’ s payment . And so it was done . But when morning come, the singer had vanished . . . and so had Lord Brandon ’ s maiden daughter . Her bed they found empty, but for the pale blue rose that Bael had left on the pillow where her head had lain.
Jon had never heard this tale before . [BOS] Which Brandon was this supposed to be? Brandon the Builder lived in the Age of Heroes, thousands of years before Bael . There was Brandon the Burner and his father Brandon the Shipwright, but— [EOS]
This was Brandon the Daughterless,  Ygritte said sharply .  Would you hear the tale, or no?
He scowled .  Go on.
Lord Brandon had no other children . At his behest, the black crows flew forth from their castles in the hundreds, but nowhere could they find any sign o ’ Bael or this maid . For most a year they searched, till the lord lost heart and took to his bed, and it seemed as though the line o ’ Starks was at its end . But one night as he lay waiting to die, Lord Brandon heard a child ’ s cry . He followed the sound and found his daughter back in her bedchamber, asleep with a babe at her breast.
Bael had brought her back?
No . They had been in Winterfell all the time, hiding with the dead beneath the castle . The maid loved Bael so dearly she bore him a son, the song says . . . though if truth be told, all the maids love Bael in them songs he wrote . Be that as it may, what ’ s certain is that Bael left the child in payment for the rose he ’ d plucked unasked, and that the boy grew to be the next Lord Stark . So there it is—you have Bael ’ s blood in you, same as me.
Jon said . [BOS] It never happened, [EOS]
She shrugged .  Might be it did, might be it didn ’ t . It is a good song, though . My mother used to sing it to me . She was a woman too, Jon Snow . Like yours.  She rubbed her throat where his dirk had cut her .  The song ends when they find the babe, but there is a darker end to the story . Thirty years later, when Bael was King-beyond-the-Wall and led the free folk south, it was young Lord Stark who met him at the Frozen Ford . . . and killed him, for Bael would not harm his own son when they met sword to sword.
So the son slew the father instead,  said Jon.
Aye,  she said,  but the gods hate kinslayers, even when they kill unknowing . When Lord Stark returned from the battle and his mother saw Bael ’ s head upon his spear, she threw herself from a tower in her grief . Her son did not long outlive her . One o ’ his lords peeled the skin off him and wore him for a cloak.
Your Bael was a liar,  he told her, certain now.
No,  Ygritte said,  but a bard ’ s truth is different than yours or mine . Anyway, you asked for the story, so I told it.  She turned away from him, closed her eyes, and seemed to sleep.
Dawn and Qhorin Halfhand arrived together . The black stones had turned to grey and the eastern sky had gone indigo when Stonesnake spied the rangers below, wending their way upward . Jon woke his captive and held her by the arm as they descended to meet them . Thankfully, there was another way off the mountain to the north and west, along paths much gentler than the one that had brought them up here . They were waiting in a narrow defile when their brothers appeared, leading their garrons . Ghost raced ahead at first scent of them . Jon squatted to let the direwolf close his jaws around his wrist, tugging his hand back and forth . It was a game they played . But when he glanced up, he saw Ygritte watching with eyes as wide and white as hen ’ s eggs.
Qhorin Halfhand made no comment when he saw the prisoner .  There were three,  Stonesnake told him . No more than that.
We passed two,  Ebben said,  or what the cats had left of them.  He eyed the girl sourly, suspicion plain on his face.
Jon felt compelled to say . [BOS] She yielded, [EOS]
Qhorin ’ s face was impassive .  Do you know who I am?
Qhorin Halfhand.  The girl looked half a child beside him, but she faced him boldly.
Tell me true . If I fell into the hands of your people and yielded myself, what would it win me?
A slower death than elsewise.
The big ranger looked to Jon .  We have no food to feed her, nor can we spare a man to watch her.
The way before us is perilous enough, lad,  said Squire Dalbridge .  One shout when we need silence, and every man of us is doomed.
Ebben drew his dagger .  A steel kiss will keep her quiet.
Jon ’ s throat was raw . He looked at them all helplessly . [BOS] She yielded herself to me . [EOS]
Then you must do what needs be done,  Qhorin Halfhand said .  You are the blood of Winterfell and a man of the Night ’ s Watch.  He looked at the others .  Come, brothers . Leave him to it . It will go easier for him if we do not watch.  And he led them up the steep twisting trail toward the pale pink glow of the sun where it broke through a mountain cleft, and before very long only Jon and Ghost remained with the wildling girl.
He thought Ygritte might try to run, but she only stood there, waiting, looking at him .  You never killed a woman before, did you?  When he shook his head, she said,  We die the same as men . But you don ’ t need to do it . Mance would take you, I know he would . There ’ s secret ways . Them crows would never catch us.
Jon said . [BOS] I ’ m as much a crow as they are, [EOS]
She nodded, resigned .  Will you burn me, after?
I can ’ t . The smoke might be seen.
That ’ s so.  She shrugged .  Well, there ’ s worse places to end up than the belly of a shadowcat.
He pulled Longclaw over a shoulder .  Aren ’ t you afraid?
Last night I was,  she admitted .  But now the sun ’ s up.  She pushed her hair aside to bare her neck, and knelt before him .  Strike hard and true, crow, or I ’ ll come back and haunt you.
Longclaw was not so long or heavy a sword as his father ’ s Ice, but it was Valyrian steel all the same . He touched the edge of the blade to mark where the blow must fall, and Ygritte shivered .  That ’ s cold,  she said .  Go on, be quick about it.
He raised Longclaw over his head, both hands tight around the grip . One cut, with all my weight behind it . He could give her a quick clean death, at least . He was his father ’ s son . Wasn ’ t he? Wasn ’ t he?
Do it,  she urged him after a moment .  Bastard . Do it . I can ’ t stay brave forever.  When the blow did not fall she turned her head to look at him.
Jon lowered his sword . [BOS] Go, [EOS] he muttered.
Ygritte stared.
Now,  he said,  before my wits return . Go.
She went.
It was dark in the Skirling Pass . The great stone flanks of the mountains hid the sun for most of the day, so they rode in shadow, the breath of man and horse steaming in the cold air . Icy fingers of water trickled down from the snowpack above into small frozen pools that cracked and broke beneath the hooves of their garrons . Sometimes they would see a few weeds struggling from some crack in the rock or a splotch of pale lichen, but there was no grass, and they were above the trees now.
The track was as steep as it was narrow, wending its way ever upward . Where the pass was so constricted that rangers had to go single file, Squire Dalbridge would take the lead, scanning the heights as he went, his longbow ever close to hand . It was said he had the keenest eyes in the Night ’ s Watch.
Ghost padded restlessly by Jon ’ s side . From time to time he would stop and turn, his ears pricked, as if he heard something behind them . Jon did not think the shadowcats would attack living men, not unless they were starving, but he loosened Longclaw in its scabbard even so.
A wind-carved arch of grey stone marked the highest point of the pass . Here the way broadened as it began its long descent toward the valley of the Milkwater . Qhorin decreed that they would rest here until the shadows began to grow again .  Shadows are friends to men in black,  he said.
Jon saw the sense of that . It would be pleasant to ride in the light for a time, to let the bright mountain sun soak through their cloaks and chase the chill from their bones, but they dared not . Where there were three watchers there might be others, waiting to sound the alarm.
Stonesnake curled up under his ragged fur cloak and was asleep almost at once . Jon shared his salt beef with Ghost while Ebben and Squire Dalbridge fed the horses . Qhorin Halfhand sat with his back to a rock, honing the edge of his longsword with long slow strokes . Jon watched the ranger for a few moments, then summoned his courage and went to him .  My lord,  he said,  you never asked me how it went . With the girl.
I am no lord, Jon Snow.  Qhorin slid the stone smoothly along the steel with his two-fingered hand.
She told me Mance would take me, if I ran with her.
She told you true.
She even claimed we were kin . She told me a story . . .
. . . of Bael the Bard and the rose of Winterfell . So Stonesnake told me . It happens I know the song . Mance would sing it of old, when he came back from a ranging . He had a passion for wildling music . Aye, and for their women as well.
You knew him?
We all knew him.  His voice was sad.
They were friends as well as brothers, Jon realized, and now they are sworn foes .  Why did he desert?
For a wench, some say . For a crown, others would have it.  Qhorin tested the edge of his sword with the ball of his thumb .  He liked women, Mance did, and he was not a man whose knees bent easily, that ’ s true . But it was more than that . He loved the wild better than the Wall . It was in his blood . He was wildling born, taken as a child when some raiders were put to the sword . When he left the Shadow Tower he was only going home again.
Was he a good ranger?
He was the best of us,  said the Halfhand,  and the worst as well . Only fools like Thoren Smallwood despise the wildlings . They are as brave as we are, Jon . As strong, as quick, as clever . But they have no discipline . They name themselves the free folk, and each one thinks himself as good as a king and wiser than a maester . Mance was the same . He never learned how to obey.
No more than me,  said Jon quietly.
Qhorin ’ s shrewd grey eyes seemed to see right through him .  So you let her go?  He did not sound the least surprised.
You know?
Now . Tell me why you spared her.
It was hard to put into words . Jon stared down at his hands helplessly . [BOS] My father never used a headsman . He said he owed it to men he killed to look into their eyes and hear their last words . And when I looked into Ygritte ’ s eyes, I . . . I know she was an enemy, but there was no evil in her . [EOS]
No more than in the other two.
Jon said . [BOS] It was their lives or ours, If they had seen us, if they had sounded that horn . . . [EOS]
The wildlings would hunt us down and slay us, true enough.
Stonesnake has the horn now, though, and we took Ygritte ’ s knife and axe . She ’ s behind us, afoot, unarmed . . .
And not like to be a threat,  Qhorin agreed .  If I had needed her dead, I would have left her with Ebben, or done the thing myself.
Then why did you command it of me?
I did not command it . I told you to do what needed to be done, and left you to decide what that would be.  Qhorin stood and slid his longsword back into its scabbard .  When I want a mountain scaled, I call on Stonesnake . Should I need to put an arrow through the eye of some foe across a windy battlefield, I summon Squire Dalbridge . Ebben can make any man give up his secrets . To lead men you must know them, Jon Snow . I know more of you now than I did this morning.
And if I had slain her?  asked Jon.
She would be dead, and I would know you better than I had before . But enough talk . You ought be sleeping . We have leagues to go, and dangers to face . You will need your strength.
Jon did not think sleep would come easily, but he knew the Halfhand was right . He found a place out of the wind, beneath an overhang of rock, and took off his cloak to use it for a blanket .  Ghost,  he called .  Here . To me.  He always slept better with the great white wolf beside him; there was comfort in the smell of him, and welcome warmth in that shaggy pale fur . This time, though, Ghost did no more than look at him . Then he turned away and padded around the garrons, and quick as that he was gone . He wants to hunt, Jon thought . Perhaps there were goats in these mountains . The shadowcats must live on something .  Just don ’ t try and bring down a ’ cat,  he muttered . Even for a direwolf, that would be dangerous . He tugged his cloak over him and stretched out beneath the rock.
When he closed his eyes, he dreamed of direwolves.
There were five of them when there should have been six, and they were scattered, each apart from the others . He felt a deep ache of emptiness, a sense of incompleteness . The forest was vast and cold, and they were so small, so lost . His brothers were out there somewhere, and his sister, but he had lost their scent . He sat on his haunches and lifted his head to the darkening sky, and his cry echoed through the forest, a long lonely mournful sound . As it died away, he pricked up his ears, listening for an answer, but the only sound was the sigh of blowing snow.
The call came from behind him, softer than a whisper, but strong too . Can a shout be silent? He turned his head, searching for his brother, for a glimpse of a lean grey shape moving beneath the trees, but there was nothing, only . . .
A weirwood.
It seemed to sprout from solid rock, its pale roots twisting up from a myriad of fissures and hairline cracks . The tree was slender compared to other weirwoods he had seen, no more than a sapling, yet it was growing as he watched, its limbs thickening as they reached for the sky . Wary, he circled the smooth white trunk until he came to the face . Red eyes looked at him . Fierce eyes they were, yet glad to see him . The weirwood had his brother ’ s face . Had his brother always had three eyes?
Not always, came the silent shout . Not before the crow.
He sniffed at the bark, smelled wolf and tree and boy, but behind that there were other scents, the rich brown smell of warm earth and the hard grey smell of stone and something else, something terrible . Death, he knew . He was smelling death . He cringed back, his hair bristling, and bared his fangs.
Don ’ t be afraid, I like it in the dark . No one can see you, but you can see them . But first you have to open your eyes . See? Like this . And the tree reached down and touched him.
And suddenly he was back in the mountains, his paws sunk deep in a drift of snow as he stood upon the edge of a great precipice . Before him the Skirling Pass opened up into airy emptiness, and a long vee-shaped valley lay spread beneath him like a quilt, awash in all the colors of an autumn afternoon.
A vast blue-white wall plugged one end of the vale, squeezing between the mountains as if it had shouldered them aside, and for a moment he thought he had dreamed himself back to Castle Black . Then he realized he was looking at a river of ice several thousand feet high . Under that glittering cold cliff was a great lake, its deep cobalt waters reflecting the snowcapped peaks that ringed it . There were men down in the valley, he saw now; many men, thousands, a huge host . Some were tearing great holes in the half-frozen ground, while others trained for war . He watched as a swarming mass of riders charged a shield wall, astride horses no larger than ants . The sound of their mock battle was a rustling of steel leaves, drifting faintly on the wind . Their encampment had no plan to it; he saw no ditches, no sharpened stakes, no neat rows of horse lines . Everywhere crude earthen shelters and hide tents sprouted haphazardly, like a pox on the face of the earth . He spied untidy mounds of hay, smelled goats and sheep, horses and pigs, dogs in great profusion . Tendrils of dark smoke rose from a thousand cookfires.
This is no army, no more than it is a town . This is a whole people come together.
Across the long lake, one of the mounds moved . He watched it more closely and saw that it was not dirt at all, but alive, a shaggy lumbering beast with a snake for a nose and tusks larger than those of the greatest boar that had ever lived . And the thing riding it was huge as well, and his shape was wrong, too thick in the leg and hips to be a man.
Then a sudden gust of cold made his fur stand up, and the air thrilled to the sound of wings . As he lifted his eyes to the ice-white mountain heights above, a shadow plummeted out of the sky . A shrill scream split the air . He glimpsed blue-grey pinions spread wide, shutting out the sun . . .
Jon shouted, sitting up . He could still feel the talons, the pain . [BOS] Ghost! Ghost, to me! [EOS]
Ebben appeared, grabbed him, shook him .  Quiet! You mean to bring the wildlings down on us? What ’ s wrong with you, boy?
A dream,  said Jon feebly .  I was Ghost, I was on the edge of the mountain looking down on a frozen river, and something attacked me . A bird . . . an eagle, I think . . .
Squire Dalbridge smiled .  It ’ s always pretty women in my dreams . Would that I dreamed more often.
Qhorin came up beside him .  A frozen river, you say?
The Milkwater flows from a great lake at the foot of a glacier,  Stonesnake put in.
There was a tree with my brother ’ s face . The wildlings . . . there were thousands, more than I ever knew existed . And giants riding mammoths.  From the way the light had shifted, Jon judged that he had been asleep for four or five hours . His head ached, and the back of his neck where the talons had burned through him . But that was in the dream.
Tell me all that you remember, from first to last,  said Qhorin Halfhand.
Jon was confused . [BOS] It was only a dream . [EOS]
A wolf dream,  the Halfhand said .  Craster told the Lord Commander that the wildlings were gathering at the source of the Milkwater . That may be why you dreamed it . Or it may be that you saw what waits for us, a few hours farther on . Tell me.
It made him feel half a fool to talk of such things to Qhorin and the other rangers, but he did as he was commanded . None of the black brothers laughed at him, however . By the time he was done, even Squire Dalbridge was no longer smiling.
Skinchanger?  said Ebben grimly, looking at the Halfhand . Does he mean the eagle? Jon wondered . Or me? Skinchangers and wargs belonged in Old Nan ’ s stories, not in the world he had lived in all his life . Yet here, in this strange bleak wilderness of rock and ice, it was not hard to believe.
The cold winds are rising . Mormont feared as much . Benjen Stark felt it as well . Dead men walk and the trees have eyes again . Why should we balk at wargs and giants?
Does this mean my dreams are true as well?  asked Squire Dalbridge .  Lord Snow can keep his mammoths, I want my women.
Man and boy I ’ ve served the Watch, and ranged as far as any,  said Ebben .  I ’ ve seen the bones of giants, and heard many a queer tale, but no more . I want to see them with my own eyes.
Be careful they don ’ t see you, Ebben,  Stonesnake said.
Ghost did not reappear as they set out again . The shadows covered the floor of the pass by then, and the sun was sinking fast toward the jagged twin peaks of the huge mountain the rangers named Forktop . If the dream was true . . . Even the thought scared him . Could the eagle have hurt Ghost, or knocked him off the precipice? And what about the weirwood with his brother ’ s face, that smelled of death and darkness?
The last ray of sun vanished behind the peaks of Forktop . Twilight filled the Skirling Pass . It seemed to grow colder almost at once . They were no longer climbing . In fact, the ground had begun to descend, though as yet not sharply . It was littered with cracks and broken boulders and tumbled heaps of rock . It will be dark soon, and still no sight of Ghost . It was tearing Jon apart, yet he dare not shout for the direwolf as he would have liked . Other things might be listening as well.
Qhorin,  Squire Dalbridge called softly .  There . Look.
The eagle was perched on a spine of rock far above them, outlined against the darkening sky . We ’ ve seen other eagles, Jon thought . That need not be the one I dreamed of.
Even so, Ebben would have loosed a shaft at it, but the squire stopped him .  The bird ’ s well out of bowshot.
I don ’ t like it watching us.
The squire shrugged .  Nor me, but you won ’ t stop it . Only waste a good arrow.
Qhorin sat in his saddle, studying the eagle for a long time .  We press on,  he finally said . The rangers resumed their descent.
Ghost, Jon wanted to shout, where are you?
He was about to follow Qhorin and the others when he glimpsed a flash of white between two boulders . A patch of old snow, he thought, until he saw it stir . He was off his horse at once . As he went to his knees, Ghost lifted his head . His neck glistened wetly, but he made no sound when Jon peeled off a glove and touched him . The talons had torn a bloody path through fur and flesh, but the bird had not been able to snap his neck.
Qhorin Halfhand was standing over him .  How bad?
As if in answer, Ghost struggled to his feet.
The wolf is strong,  the ranger said .  Ebben, water . Stonesnake, your skin of wine . Hold him still, Jon.
Together they washed the caked blood from the direwolf ’ s fur . Ghost struggled and bared his teeth when Qhorin poured the wine into the ragged red gashes the eagle had left him, but Jon wrapped his arms around him and murmured soothing words, and soon enough the wolf quieted . By the time they ’ d ripped a strip from Jon ’ s cloak to wrap the wounds, full dark had settled . Only a dusting of stars set the black of sky apart from the black of stone .  Do we press on?  Stonesnake wanted to know.
Qhorin went to his garron .  Back, not on.
Back?  Jon was taken by surprise.
Eagles have sharper eyes than men . We are seen . So now we run.  The Halfhand wound a long black scarf around his face and swung up into the saddle.
The other rangers exchanged a look, but no man thought to argue . One by one they mounted and turned their mounts toward home .  Ghost, come,  he called, and the direwolf followed, a pale shadow moving through the night.
All night they rode, feeling their way up the twisting pass and through the stretches of broken ground . The wind grew stronger . Sometimes it was so dark that they dismounted and went ahead on foot, each man leading his garron . Once Ebben suggested that some torches might serve them well, but Qhorin said,  No fire,  and that was the end of that . They reached the stone bridge at the summit and began to descend again . Off in the darkness a shadowcat screamed in fury, its voice bouncing off the rocks so it seemed as though a dozen other ’ cats were giving answer . Once Jon thought he saw a pair of glowing eyes on a ledge overhead, as big as harvest moons.
In the black hour before dawn, they stopped to let the horses drink and fed them each a handful of oats and a twist or two of hay .  We are not far from the place the wildlings died,  said Qhorin .  From there, one man could hold a hundred . The right man.  He looked at Squire Dalbridge.
The squire bowed his head .  Leave me as many arrows as you can spare, brothers.  He stroked his longbow .  And see my garron has an apple when you ’ re home . He ’ s earned it, poor beastie.
He ’ s staying to die, Jon realized.
Qhorin clasped the squire ’ s forearm with a gloved hand .  If the eagle flies down for a look at you . . .
. . . he ’ ll sprout some new feathers.
The last Jon saw of Squire Dalbridge was his back as he clambered up the narrow path to the heights.
When dawn broke, Jon looked up into a cloudless sky and saw a speck moving through the blue . Ebben saw it too, and cursed, but Qhorin told him to be quiet .  Listen.
Jon held his breath, and heard it . Far away and behind them, the call of a hunting horn echoed against the mountains.
And now they come,  said Qhorin.
When Qhorin Halfhand told him to find some brush for a fire, Jon knew their end was near.
It will be good to feel warm again, if only for a little while, he told himself while he hacked bare branches from the trunk of a dead tree . Ghost sat on his haunches watching, silent as ever . Will he howl for me when I ’ m dead, as Bran ’ s wolf howled when he fell? Jon wondered . Will Shaggydog howl, far off in Winterfell, and Grey Wind and Nymeria, wherever they might be?
The moon was rising behind one mountain and the sun sinking behind another as Jon struck sparks from flint and dagger, until finally a wisp of smoke appeared . Qhorin came and stood over him as the first flame rose up flickering from the shavings of bark and dead dry pine needles .  As shy as a maid on her wedding night,  the big ranger said in a soft voice,  and near as fair . Sometimes a man forgets how pretty a fire can be.
He was not a man you ’ d expect to speak of maids and wedding nights . So far as Jon knew, Qhorin had spent his whole life in the Watch . Did he ever love a maid or have a wedding? He could not ask . Instead he fanned the fire . When the blaze was all acrackle, he peeled off his stiff gloves to warm his hands, and sighed, wondering if ever a kiss had felt as good . The warmth spread through his fingers like melting butter.
The Halfhand eased himself to the ground and sat cross-legged by the fire, the flickering light playing across the hard planes of his face . Only the two of them remained of the five rangers who had fled the Skirling Pass, back into the blue-grey wilderness of the Frostfangs.
At first Jon had nursed the hope that Squire Dalbridge would keep the wildlings bottled up in the pass . But when they ’ d heard the call of a far-off horn every man of them knew the squire had fallen . Later they spied the eagle soaring through the dusk on great blue-grey wings and Stonesnake unslung his bow, but the bird flew out of range before he could so much as string it . Ebben spat and muttered darkly of wargs and skinchangers.
They glimpsed the eagle twice more the day after, and heard the hunting horn behind them echoing against the mountains . Each time it seemed a little louder, a little closer . When night fell, the Halfhand told Ebben to take the squire ’ s garron as well as his own, and ride east for Mormont with all haste, back the way they had come . The rest of them would draw off the pursuit .  Send Jon,  Ebben had urged .  He can ride as fast as me.
Jon has a different part to play.
He is half a boy still.
No,  said Qhorin,  he is a man of the Night ’ s Watch.
When the moon rose, Ebben parted from them . Stonesnake went east with him a short way, then doubled back to obscure their tracks, and the three who remained set off toward the southwest.
After that the days and nights blurred one into the other . They slept in their saddles and stopped only long enough to feed and water the garrons, then mounted up again . Over bare rock they rode, through gloomy pine forests and drifts of old snow, over icy ridges and across shallow rivers that had no names . Sometimes Qhorin or Stonesnake would loop back to sweep away their tracks, but it was a futile gesture . They were watched . At every dawn and every dusk they saw the eagle soaring between the peaks, no more than a speck in the vastness of the sky.
They were scaling a low ridge between two snowcapped peaks when a shadowcat came snarling from its lair, not ten yards away . The beast was gaunt and half-starved, but the sight of it sent Stonesnake ’ s mare into a panic; she reared and ran, and before the ranger could get her back under control she had stumbled on the steep slope and broken a leg.
Ghost ate well that day, and Qhorin insisted that the rangers mix some of the garron ’ s blood with their oats, to give them strength . The taste of that foul porridge almost choked Jon, but he forced it down . They each cut a dozen strips of raw stringy meat from the carcass to chew on as they rode, and left the rest for the shadowcats.
There was no question of riding double . Stonesnake offered to lay in wait for the pursuit and surprise them when they came . Perhaps he could take a few of them with him down to hell . Qhorin refused .  If any man in the Night ’ s Watch can make it through the Frostfangs alone and afoot, it is you, brother . You can go over mountains that a horse must go around . Make for the Fist . Tell Mormont what Jon saw, and how . Tell him that the old powers are waking, that he faces giants and wargs and worse . Tell him that the trees have eyes again.
He has no chance, Jon thought when he watched Stonesnake vanish over a snow-covered ridge, a tiny black bug crawling across a rippling expanse of white.
After that, every night seemed colder than the night before, and more lonely . Ghost was not always with them, but he was never far either . Even when they were apart, Jon sensed his nearness . He was glad for that . The Halfhand was not the most companionable of men . Qhorin ’ s long grey braid swung slowly with the motion of his horse . Often they would ride for hours without a word spoken, the only sounds the soft scrape of horseshoes on stone and the keening of the wind, which blew endlessly through the heights . When he slept, he did not dream; not of wolves, nor his brothers, nor anything . Even dreams cannot live up here, he told himself.
Is your sword sharp, Jon Snow?  asked Qhorin Halfhand across the flickering fire.
My sword is Valyrian steel . The Old Bear gave it to me.
Do you remember the words of your vow?
Yes.  They were not words a man was like to forget . Once said, they could never be unsaid . They changed your life forever.
Say them again with me, Jon Snow.
If you like.  Their voices blended as one beneath the rising moon, while Ghost listened and the mountains themselves bore witness .  Night gathers, and now my watch begins . It shall not end until my death . I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children . I shall wear no crowns and win no glory . I shall live and die at my post . I am the sword in the darkness . I am the watcher on the walls . I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men . I pledge my life and honor to the Night ’ s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.
When they were done, there was no sound but the faint crackle of the flames and a distant sigh of wind . Jon opened and closed his burnt fingers, holding tight to the words in his mind, praying that his father ’ s gods would give him the strength to die bravely when his hour came . It would not be long now . The garrons were near the end of their strength . Qhorin ’ s mount would not last another day, Jon suspected.
The flames were burning low by then, the warmth fading .  The fire will soon go out,  Qhorin said,  but if the Wall should ever fall, all the fires will go out.
There was nothing Jon could say to that . He nodded.
We may escape them yet,  the ranger said .  Or not.
I ’ m not afraid to die.  It was only half a lie.
It may not be so easy as that, Jon.
He did not understand .  What do you mean?
If we are taken, you must yield.
Yield?  He blinked in disbelief . The wildlings did not make captives of the men they called the crows . They killed them, except for . . .  They only spare oathbreakers . Those who join them, like Mance Rayder.
And you.
No.  He shook his head .  Never . I won ’ t.
You will . I command it of you.
Command it? But . . .
Our honor means no more than our lives, so long as the realm is safe . Are you a man of the Night ’ s Watch?
Yes, but—
There is no but, Jon Snow . You are, or you are not.
Jon sat up straight . [BOS] I am . [EOS]
Then hear me . If we are taken, you will go over to them, as the wildling girl you captured once urged you . They may demand that you cut your cloak to ribbons, that you swear them an oath on your father ’ s grave, that you curse your brothers and your Lord Commander . You must not balk, whatever is asked of you . Do as they bid you . . . but in your heart, remember who and what you are . Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them, for as long as it takes . And watch.
Jon asked . [BOS] For what? [EOS]
Would that I knew,  said Qhorin .  Your wolf saw their diggings in the valley of the Milkwater . What did they seek, in such a bleak and distant place? Did they find it? That is what you must learn, before you return to Lord Mormont and your brothers . That is the duty I lay on you, Jon Snow.
Jon said reluctantly, [BOS] I ’ ll do as you say, but . . . you will tell them, won ’ t you? The Old Bear, at least? You ’ ll tell him that I never broke my oath . [EOS]
Qhorin Halfhand gazed at him across the fire, his eyes lost in pools of shadow .  When I see him next . I swear it.  He gestured at the fire .  More wood . I want it bright and hot.
Jon went to cut more branches, snapping each one in two before tossing it into the flames . The tree had been dead a long time, but it seemed to live again in the fire, as fiery dancers woke within each stick of wood to whirl and spin in their glowing gowns of yellow, red, and orange.
Enough,  Qhorin said abruptly .  Now we ride.
Ride?  It was dark beyond the fire, and the night was cold .  Ride where?
Back.  Qhorin mounted his weary garron one more time .  The fire will draw them past, I hope . Come, brother.
Jon pulled on his gloves again and raised his hood . Even the horses seemed reluctant to leave the fire . The sun was long gone, and only the cold silver shine of the half-moon remained to light their way over the treacherous ground that lay behind them . He did not know what Qhorin had in mind, but perhaps it was a chance . He hoped so . I do not want to play the oathbreaker, even for good reason.
They went cautiously, moving as silent as man and horse could move, retracing their steps until they reached the mouth of a narrow defile where an icy little stream emerged from between two mountains . Jon remembered the place . They had watered the horses here before the sun went down.
The water ’ s icing up,  Qhorin observed as he turned aside,  else we ’ d ride in the streambed . But if we break the ice, they are like to see . Keep close to the cliffs . There ’ s a crook a half mile on that will hide us.  He rode into the defile . Jon gave one last wistful look to their distant fire, and followed.
The farther in they went, the closer the cliffs pressed to either side . They followed the moonlit ribbon of stream back toward its source . Icicles bearded its stony banks, but Jon could still hear the sound of rushing water beneath the thin hard crust.
A great jumble of fallen rock blocked their way partway up, where a section of the cliff face had fallen, but the surefooted little garrons were able to pick their way through . Beyond, the walls pinched in sharply, and the stream led them to the foot of a tall twisting waterfall . The air was full of mist, like the breath of some vast cold beast . The tumbling waters shone silver in the moonlight . Jon looked about in dismay . There is no way out . He and Qhorin might be able to climb the cliffs, but not with the horses . He did not think they would last long afoot.
Quickly now,  the Halfhand commanded . The big man on the small horse rode over the ice-slick stones, right into the curtain of water, and vanished . When he did not reappear, Jon put his heels into his horse and went after . His garron did his best to shy away . The falling water slapped at them with frozen fists, and the shock of the cold seemed to stop Jon ’ s breath.
Then he was through; drenched and shivering, but through.
The cleft in the rock was barely large enough for man and horse to pass, but beyond, the walls opened up and the floor turned to soft sand . Jon could feel the spray freezing in his beard . Ghost burst through the waterfall in an angry rush, shook droplets from his fur, sniffed at the darkness suspiciously, then lifted a leg against one rocky wall . Qhorin had already dismounted . Jon did the same .  You knew this place was here.
When I was no older than you, I heard a brother tell how he followed a shadowcat through these falls.  He unsaddled his horse, removed her bit and bridle, and ran his fingers through her shaggy mane .  There is a way through the heart of the mountain . Come dawn, if they have not found us, we will press on . The first watch is mine, brother.  Qhorin seated himself on the sand, his back to a wall, no more than a vague black shadow in the gloom of the cave . Over the rush of falling waters, Jon heard a soft sound of steel on leather that could only mean that the Halfhand had drawn his sword.
He took off his wet cloak, but it was too cold and damp here to strip down any further . Ghost stretched out beside him and licked his glove before curling up to sleep . Jon was grateful for his warmth . He wondered if the fire was still burning outside, or if it had gone out by now . If the Wall should ever fall, all the fires will go out . The moon shone through the curtain of falling water to lay a shimmering pale stripe across the sand, but after a time that too faded and went dark.
Sleep came at last, and with it nightmares . He dreamed of burning castles and dead men rising unquiet from their graves . It was still dark when Qhorin woke him . While the Halfhand slept, Jon sat with his back to the cave wall, listening to the water and waiting for the dawn.
At break of day, they each chewed a half-frozen strip of horsemeat, then saddled their garrons once again, and fastened their black cloaks around their shoulders . During his watch the Halfhand had made a half-dozen torches, soaking bundles of dry moss with the oil he carried in his saddlebag . He lit the first one now and led the way down into the dark, holding the pale flame up before him . Jon followed with the horses . The stony path twisted and turned, first down, then up, then down more steeply . In spots it grew so narrow it was hard to convince the garrons they could squeeze through . By the time we come out we will have lost them, he told himself as they went . Not even an eagle can see through solid stone . We will have lost them, and we will ride hard for the Fist, and tell the Old Bear all we know.
But when they emerged back into the light long hours later, the eagle was waiting for them, perched on a dead tree a hundred feet up the slope . Ghost went bounding up the rocks after it, but the bird flapped its wings and took to the air.
Qhorin ’ s mouth tightened as he followed its flight with his eyes .  Here is as good a place as any to make a stand,  he declared .  The mouth of the cave shelters us from above, and they cannot get behind us without passing through the mountain . Is your sword sharp, Jon Snow?
Yes,  he said.
We ’ ll feed the horses . They ’ ve served us bravely, poor beasts.
Jon gave his garron the last of the oats and stroked his shaggy mane while Ghost prowled restlessly amongst the rocks . He pulled his gloves on tighter and flexed his burnt fingers . I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
A hunting horn echoed through the mountains, and a moment later Jon heard the baying of hounds .  They will be with us soon,  announced Qhorin .  Keep your wolf in hand.
Jon called . The direwolf returned reluctantly to his side, tail held stiffly behind him . [BOS] Ghost, to me, [EOS]
The wildlings came boiling over a ridge not half a mile away . Their hounds ran before them, snarling grey-brown beasts with more than a little wolf in their blood . Ghost bared his teeth, his fur bristling . Jon murmured . [BOS] Easy, Stay. [EOS] Overhead he heard a rustle of wings . The eagle landed on an outcrop of rock and screamed in triumph.
The hunters approached warily, perhaps fearing arrows . Jon counted fourteen, with eight dogs . Their large round shields were made of skins stretched over woven wicker and painted with skulls . About half of them hid their faces behind crude helms of wood and boiled leather . On either wing, archers notched shafts to the strings of small wood-and-horn bows, but did not loose . The rest seemed to be armed with spears and mauls . One had a chipped stone axe . They wore only what bits of armor they had looted from dead rangers or stolen during raids . Wildlings did not mine or smelt, and there were few smiths and fewer forges north of the Wall.
Qhorin drew his longsword . The tale of how he had taught himself to fight with his left hand after losing half of his right was part of his legend; it was said that he handled a blade better now than he ever had before . Jon stood shoulder to shoulder with the big ranger and pulled Longclaw from its sheath . Despite the chill in the air, sweat stung his eyes.
Ten yards below the cave mouth the hunters halted . Their leader came on alone, riding a beast that seemed more goat than horse, from the surefooted way it climbed the uneven slope . As man and mount grew nearer Jon could hear them clattering; both were armored in bones . Cow bones, sheep bones, the bones of goats and aurochs and elk, the great bones of the hairy mammoths . . . and human bones as well.
Rattleshirt,  Qhorin called down, icy-polite.
To crows I be the Lord o ’ Bones.  The rider ’ s helm was made from the broken skull of a giant, and all up and down his arms bearclaws had been sewn to his boiled leather.
Qhorin snorted .  I see no lord . Only a dog dressed in chickenbones, who rattles when he rides.
The wildling hissed in anger, and his mount reared . He did rattle, Jon could hear it; the bones were strung together loosely, so they clacked and clattered when he moved .  It ’ s your bones I ’ ll be rattling soon, Halfhand . I ’ ll boil the flesh off you and make a byrnie from your ribs . I ’ ll carve your teeth to cast me runes, and eat me oaten porridge from your skull.
If you want my bones, come get them.
That, Rattleshirt seemed reluctant to do . His numbers meant little in the close confines of the rocks where the black brothers had taken their stand; to winkle them out of the cave the wildlings would need to come up two at a time . But another of his company edged a horse up beside him, one of the fighting women called spearwives .  We are four-and-ten to two, crows, and eight dogs to your wolf,  she called .  Fight or run, you are ours.
Show them,  commanded Rattleshirt.
The woman reached into a bloodstained sack and drew out a trophy . Ebben had been bald as an egg, so she dangled the head by an ear .  He died brave,  she said.
But he died,  said Rattleshirt,  same like you.  He freed his battle-axe, brandishing it above his head . Good steel it was, with a wicked gleam to both blades; Ebben was never a man to neglect his weapons . The other wildlings crowded forward beside him, yelling taunts . A few chose Jon for their mockery .  Is that your wolf, boy?  a skinny youth called, unlimbering a stone flail .  He ’ ll be my cloak before the sun is down.  On the other side of the line, another spearwife opened her ragged furs to show Jon a heavy white breast .  Does the baby want his momma? Come, have a suck o ’ this, boy.  The dogs were barking too.
They would shame us into folly.  Qhorin gave Jon a long look .  Remember your orders.
Belike we need to flush the crows,  Rattleshirt bellowed over the clamor .  Feather them!
No!  The word burst from Jon ’ s lips before the bowmen could loose . He took two quick steps forward .  We yield!
They warned me bastard blood was craven,  he heard Qhorin Halfhand say coldly behind him .  I see it is so . Run to your new masters, coward.
Face reddening, Jon descended the slope to where Rattleshirt sat his horse . The wildling stared at him through the eyeholes of his helm, and said,  The free folk have no need of cravens.
He is no craven.  One of the archers pulled off her sewn sheepskin helm and shook out a head of shaggy red hair .  This is the Bastard o ’ Winterfell, who spared me . Let him live.
Jon met Ygritte ’ s eyes, and had no words.
Let him die,  insisted the Lord of Bones .  The black crow is a tricksy bird . I trust him not.
On a rock above them, the eagle flapped its wings and split the air with a scream of fury.
The bird hates you, Jon Snow,  said Ygritte .  And well he might . He was a man, before you killed him.
I did not know,  said Jon truthfully, trying to remember the face of the man he had slain in the pass .  You told me Mance would take me.
And he will,  Ygritte said.
Mance is not here,  said Rattleshirt .  Ragwyle, gut him.
The big spearwife narrowed her eyes and said,  If the crow would join the free folk, let him show us his prowess and prove the truth of him.
I ’ ll do whatever you ask.  The words came hard, but Jon said them.
Rattleshirt ’ s bone armor clattered loudly as he laughed .  Then kill the Halfhand, bastard.
As if he could,  said Qhorin .  Turn, Snow, and die.
And then Qhorin ’ s sword was coming at him and somehow Longclaw leapt upward to block . The force of impact almost knocked the bastard blade from Jon ’ s hand, and sent him staggering backward . You must not balk, whatever is asked of you . He shifted to a two-hand grip, quick enough to deliver a stroke of his own, but the big ranger brushed it aside with contemptuous ease . Back and forth they went, black cloaks swirling, the youth ’ s quickness against the savage strength of Qhorin ’ s left-hand cuts . The Halfhand ’ s longsword seemed to be everywhere at once, raining down from one side and then the other, driving him where he would, keeping him off balance . Already he could feel his arms growing numb.
Even when Ghost ’ s teeth closed savagely around the ranger ’ s calf, somehow Qhorin kept his feet . But in that instant, as he twisted, the opening was there . Jon planted and pivoted . The ranger was leaning away, and for an instant it seemed that Jon ’ s slash had not touched him . Then a string of red tears appeared across the big man ’ s throat, bright as a ruby necklace, and the blood gushed out of him, and Qhorin Halfhand fell.
Ghost ’ s muzzle was dripping red, but only the point of the bastard blade was stained, the last half inch . Jon pulled the direwolf away and knelt with one arm around him . The light was already fading in Qhorin ’ s eyes .  . . . sharp,  he said, lifting his maimed fingers . Then his hand fell, and he was gone.
He knew, he thought numbly . He knew what they would ask of me . He thought of Samwell Tarly then, of Grenn and Dolorous Edd, of Pyp and Toad back at Castle Black . Had he lost them all, as he had lost Bran and Rickon and Robb? Who was he now? What was he?
Get him up.  Rough hands dragged him to his feet . Jon did not resist .  Do you have a name?
Ygritte answered for him .  His name is Jon Snow . He is Eddard Stark ’ s blood, of Winterfell.
Ragwyle laughed .  Who would have thought it? Qhorin Halfhand slain by some lordling ’ s byblow.
Gut him.  That was Rattleshirt, still ahorse . The eagle flew to him and perched atop his bony helm, screeching.
He yielded,  Ygritte reminded them.
Aye, and slew his brother,  said a short homely man in a rust-eaten iron halfhelm.
Rattleshirt rode closer, bones clattering .  The wolf did his work for him . It were foully done . The Halfhand ’ s death was mine.
We all saw how eager you were to take it,  mocked Ragwyle.
He is a warg,  said the Lord of Bones,  and a crow . I like him not.
A warg he may be,  Ygritte said,  but that has never frightened us.  Others shouted agreement . Behind the eyeholes of his yellowed skull Rattleshirt ’ s stare was malignant, but he yielded grudgingly . These are a free folk indeed, thought Jon.
They burned Qhorin Halfhand where he ’ d fallen, on a pyre made of pine needles, brush, and broken branches . Some of the wood was still green, and it burned slow and smoky, sending a black plume up into the bright hard blue of the sky . Afterward Rattleshirt claimed some charred bones, while the others threw dice for the ranger ’ s gear . Ygritte won his cloak.
Jon asked her . He did not know if he could face those heights again, or if his garron could survive a second crossing . [BOS] Will we return by the Skirling Pass? [EOS]
No,  she said .  There ’ s nothing behind us.  The look she gave him was sad .  By now Mance is well down the Milkwater, marching on your Wall.
