Jon had just been told that he was going to take part in a special mission for the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Jon had asked Benjen aside, to ask permission. Even as a bastard, Bran's heart felt the pull of the Night's Watch when his father died. Jon could see it in his face 


A:You want to be a Ranger, too, My Lord. 
B:We have given our lives... 
C:If I become a bastard, my father's blood will be wasted on others.

  Jon decided. And Benjen smiled 


A:Yes, My Lord, 
B:I'll give you my sword, Your Grace. You'll be safe on it, I promise.. 
C:I will, My Lord, when I climb north.

  Jon said simply. It was love. That night in the muck, even as a bastard they remembered every step. One boy to another beneath the sky, their eyes closed and hands pumping hard for a breath. The first Ranger, Reek told him 


A:If someone will me... 
B:If the red-eyed corpses were right about what had happened … I'd be out of a job. 
C:Is your lord right? Did you kill another boy?

 Then a grunt left his throat and Jon found himself floating face down in the dark, skin pink all over 


A:Let's go now, Maester Aemon. 
B:Come on, 
C:What Are You Doing To Me?

  Jon was powerless to stand or move after that, but his eyes were wide open and blue eyes staring at him 


A:A crippled boy with one hand and no mother to guide them. They will follow us. 
B:Are you listening, Maester Aemon? 
C:Robert had found it, My Lady, and it is a good thing, the long summer is over.

  Jon turned away. All the other lords were silent 


A:Is that what you want? To make us like you? 
B:You know nothing, My Lord. 
C:If you want them to follow, you need to do it yourself.

  Jon took a step forward to help him up 


A:What is it? Come along now, Your Grace.. 
B:It is what I want 
C:Well, my lord, if you say so, Lord Mormont.

 The king turned and spoke angrily to his steward, Ser Alliser Thorne. Lord Eddard Stark stood silently next to Ser Denys Mallister as they pushed Bran out of his way. 


A:I can't give up this. If the boy dies, they'll never know for certain, and the fear of their father. 
B:They do not wish to see the king sent to see Lady Stark, 
C:Lord Lannister cannot allow this to stand unchallenged, Your Grace.

  Jon added, My brother had served another king, and I was sorry. 


A:Sam promised 
B:And where did they go? My father had taken them back to Winterfell. How did you feels that? 
C:A flop of his cloak revealing a hooked face, but there was a proud face.

 We must hold them off, if we can. Once we've took King's Landing, we'll ride south to White Harbor, our ships will be enough to take her back to Westeros, where we belong.. 
alliser said, 


A:And you think I can't do this? 
B:It isn't enough, 
C:This is Gilly, I beg you. If you ever see her again,

  Jon insisted, ” You might be right, but it won't be easy. 


A:We shall find my brother and Otheil," 
B:What else can you do to me? What else can they do to us? 
C:First Sword of Braavos, Lord Glover of Winterfell, Lord Stark's Hand,

  Jon insisted. They would never let me near them again.' Jon could feel the pain in his leg as 


A:We have had enough of that,. You could do better,. 
B:The lads will not give it up for you, not until you cut them free.' 
C:The wolf howled, and there were three more! You hear me?".

  Jon knew there was no answer for her. But she screamed  Jon could hear her screaming and see the tears rolling down her cheeks 


A:Not enough. You cut me, 
B:If you wanted to piss, you should have stopped the fire,, 
C:I How could?

 she said to him. Her voice was sweet and warm, like a mother's. Jon laughed 


A:Good, I hear. Well,. 
B:So sweet. 
C:I don't think she feels sorry for me at all.

  Jon tried to smile, but all she could think was what had happened to their father. 


A:This is strange. You're more like my own little sister than they were. 
B:Is it true? 
C:If I never wanted you back, I did now. You heard it in your voice when you fell from your horse. A woman's words

  Jon remembered her smiling at him.  Half the boys in the North had been orphaned by the time they were eight or nine. It was a new thing to her, to admit that she belonged anywhere, to look others in the eye as they did now. Jon smiled back. 


A:I'm sorry, Aunt Lysa. 
B:I'm sorry, Your Grace. I didn't mean.... 
C:Come on,

  Jon smiled back, trying not to show any of the warmth of his heart. The warmth of his heart 


A:I'm not sorry, I love her, 
B:It was always my color, even when I was a bastard boy. 
C:Come in..

  Jon said softly. At once, all the wildlings looked up to Gilly, their hearts beating. Sam and  Ghost joined them, smiling
